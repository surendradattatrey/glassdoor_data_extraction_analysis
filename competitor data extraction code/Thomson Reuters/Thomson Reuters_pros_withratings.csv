4140,467,"I'm a technology person, working for a company that sells information products to professionals. In my area of the company, those professionals are lawyers. So a lot of what I do revolves around automating the drudgery involved in the practice of law. There are a lot of lawyers and legal editors that work for TR and many of the reviews on the company come from them. But there are also a lot of technology people in... the company working within a very large technology organization.

I've been with TR for almost 10 years and in that time have had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of information processing systems. TR has the most complex systems space I've ever encountered, so much so that it's very hard to get the lay-of-the-land when coming into the company. Documentation is hit-or-miss and like many places I've worked, getting the full story on a particular system requires talking to the right people. With the advent of a new internal company web site - ""theHub"" - finding those people is much easier than it used to be.

TR is big on culture and recently rolled out across-the-board training on values and culture in the workplace. Much of it is obvious stuff but it's nice that the company is investing in making sure everyone knows how to conduct themselves in the work place, understands the basics of human nature, and understands that acting with a certain level of sincerity and trust is important.

The benefits are average, in large part due to cost cutting constantly chipping away at benefits and pay. Some of it reaches the level of absurdity and employee morale at times suffers. Attrition has recently become a problem as the local (and national) job market improves and folks go looking for greener pastures. One of the frustrating decisions from upper management is that senior positions will not be back filled. Instead, new grad hires will be brought in as a way to keep head count steady and cut costs. Like with all companies, every time a senior employee leaves they take a wealth of knowledge and experience with them.

The Rochester office is almost a company-within-a-company with a culture all its own. The mother ship (at least for the legal division) is in Eagan MN and it's there that most of the high-level decisions come from. It's also where most of the big-company, do-it-by-the-book, corporate attitude resides. But I must say, at least in the technology division, there's also some real human compassion for the worker bee and their importance in getting things done.

The people in the Rochester office are terrific. The tech folks are among the best and brightest I’ve ever worked with. The legal folks are great too, but I can’t speak to the work environment they deal with. I know they’ve had to deal with down-sizing and cost cutting changes that have affected their quality of work life. One of the best things about the Rochester office, in my opinion, is the flexibility in work hours that the management team allows. Workers with young families can adjust their hours to accommodate school events, sick kids, etc. Working from home on occasion is also permitted which further enhances the flexibility options.

All in all, my experience at TR has been positive and I would encourage anyone thinking of working here to give it serious consideration.",2

The company is in the midst of a transformation - and has been in a constant state of flux for years....  This change does feel different, however, with a much greater sense of purpose, and results starting to show.  It is very strong on virtual collaboration.  There is a big network of Telepresence and VC, and WebEx connect is used well, as well as the social intranet which is highly trafficked and gives a good opportunity to engage with people globally whom you otherwise wouldn't get to know.

It also has some very strong business resource groups: I'm an active member of Pride at Work, for LGBT employees and friends, which is a close-knit global network.  The company has done a lot to demonstrate its support for LGBT employees, with a big presence at Pride in London, for instance, and statements in support of marriage equality in the UK and Minnesota.

7374,828,"The people are great.  I've never worked in a sales environment that was so positive and my teammates are all really helpful.  It's not your typical cut-throat sales model where the person sitting next to you is trying to take your deals.  Instead they are willing to offer up assistance which is extremely helpful (especially for new hires).  
A healthy work/life balance is strongly encouraged by management which... has lead to good morale and people at all levels are treated with fairness and respect.  It today’s shaky economy, it's definitely a good place to work and one I would recommend to others.",5

Quite a few people, even in senior management, come in early and leave early without it being a career limiting move.  The technology organization is especially competent, and anyone with a good idea that can define the good idea in terms that the technology folks can understand is treated... with respect and sometimes even adulation.  The strategic marketing services organization is bright, strategic, analytical, and continues to be on the cutting edge.  The content operations group and the content technology group are competent professionals led by competent professionals.",4
7384,829,"A truly global company with excellent journalists, many of whom are truly authorities on the subjects they cover. The quality of the news is very high, but not complacent - the organisation has the self-awareness to be healthily self-critical. The journalists are very committed, simply because most of them could earn more elsewhere. So if they don't like it, they quit. Top management is generally open to innovative... ideas about how to improve things, although bureaucracy can stifle efforts for change, just like anywhere. The culture is open and accepting of diversity. Mistakes tend to be dealt with in a sensible way: acknowledged and investigated enough to avoid repetition, but only punished if they are disastrous, repeated and stupid, or go against the code of conduct.
The recent takeover of Reuters by Thomson has opened up huge opportunities for the business, but also for employees, since we now have a much wider range of job opportunities. It is also giving an fresh impetus to reform of the company, including a much-needed revamp of our products and our editorial systems and a clearing of the cobwebs elsewhere.
There are also opportunities to live and work in places that other companies have hardly even heard of.",5

Lots of opportunity for development and career progression: There are plenty of opportunities for internal movement, easy to find new jobs and most managers are supportive of career development. 
Good flexibility if you are a woman: Maternity leave policy is very good and flexible working is at quite a decent level... in the company. Many people work from home 1 or 2 days a week or come back after maternity on a part time basis. 
Environment: quite good environment, not stressing. Offices are open plan and only a few managers at the highest level have their own offices.",2
