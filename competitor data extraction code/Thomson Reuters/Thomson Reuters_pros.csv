"2","Family friendly environment to work in."
"3","Great benefits, excellent leadership, and a very cooperative culture."
"4","Local management is good.  Technologies used are mostly what I want to work with."
"5","Management is O.K. about personal time, Dr. appt's, Denists, something happening at home.  Working from home allowed at times.  Twice yearly review of your job, how are you doing, where do you want to go survey."
"6","Great work environment and professional oportunities."
"7","Industry leader. Decent Compensation. Westlaw is the best product in the market, way better than the competitor Lexis Nexis."
"8","Big global company leader of news service"
"9","Blue chip company. Lots of history and truly international. There are 2 arms to the business - Editorial & Information Technology. The experience will be dependent on which arm you work for. Reasonable career growth. A good name to have on your resume and a great stepping stone to another company."
"10","Working with professional colleagues for a company that is the industry leader."
"11","There are plenty of career opportunities (if you are willing to look for them). With over 50,000 employees and 300 offices in over 90 countries there are jobs out there in every imaginable role."
"12","They don't get trapped into thinking their way is the best/only way to do something. They encourage thinking about new technology and how to leverage it to improve the existing design. 

For me a benefit is the relaxed team atmosphere. I have people to go to for help, but each piece is independent so I'm not constantly having to negotiate around what other people are doing."
"13","A good chance to hone professional skills, and to achieve a varied skill set at a very successful company."
"14","Pay and career growth if you're willing to sell your soul"
"15","The best reason to work for Thomson Reuters is the people. They have done an excellent job of assembling some very talented folks. The problem is after awhile the ineptitude of the senior managment errodes away at that talent so much so that they leave the company."
"16","benefits are good, especially now that vacation time has been made more typical (3 weeks rather than 2 for employees under 5 years)"
"17","i get to work with smart, interesting people in a fast-moving industry. thomson reuters is very good about rotating people through different functions and divisions, to ensure that your skill set is always growing and that you don't get bored easily."
"18","Stable and growing.  The facilities are fantastic.  In my area, at least, there is no real pressure to be married to the job (stay late, work weekends, etc.).  We usually have access to the best resources (computers, supplies, etc.) available."
"19","If you are young and just out of college, it's a good place to start.  But the raises given to employees after five years are puny (2-3%) and without getting a promotion there is little chance for increasing your pay.  In other words, the longer that you are employed the less you are appreciated.  In all fairness, Thomson and Reuters have just merged, so there is hope for some change, although the previous ... acquisitions and mergers have not shown many changes."
"20","Great sense of involvement, ability to work worldwide, good range of options in terms of job role, self accountability in tasks and are trusted to work alone.  Time management flexible and generally job is results based.  Mgt ability is varied from role to role but the ability to manoevre usually allows ways around this."
"21","The free coffee in the C building is pretty good."
"22","It's a stable company. There are many opportunities to move around in the company and there are a lot of challenges."
"23","It's a big company with a lot of different opportunities to move around and try new things. There are many opportunities for training and professional growth."
"24","Benefits are relatively good. The group I worked in had a casual dress code. Company seems to be doing well financially."
"25","At the front of news production, Reuters is/was a globally recognised brand that is/was known for its impartial reporting, hopefully this will continue under the new regime."
"26","Global company: being an international company makes people from all over the world feel welcomed.
Lots of opportunity for development and career progression: There are plenty of opportunities for internal movement, easy to find new jobs and most managers are supportive of career development. 
Good flexibility if you are a woman: Maternity leave policy is very good and flexible working is at quite a decent level... in the company. Many people work from home 1 or 2 days a week or come back after maternity on a part time basis. 
Environment: quite good environment, not stressing. Offices are open plan and only a few managers at the highest level have their own offices."
"27","They hand out generous bonuses at the director level and above.  They make appropriate investments in technology and tools, although the training is often inadequate and implementation is done too quickly."
"28","Large enterprise with many opportunities to move throughout a global company.  The benefits are great for a large company. Great health benefits; great extra learning opportunities, still has a pension plan, 401k with company match;"
"29","The people are respectful and motivated.  Regular hours and the suburban location.  Many in management support taking risks to improve the way we go about our work."
"30","There is career advancement at Thomson West.  However, even though the ""merger"" happened over 5 years ago and Thomson was the acquiring company, the Minnesota-based West Publishing culture still prevails."
"31","Thomson offers good environment for a sales professional with proper balance of compensation, work load and personal life.  Management are approachable and competent but as with all companies of this size politics do exist but not to the level that it is the focus of the company culture.  Opportunities for advancement are good and the turnover in sales is relatively low.  Overall a positive sales environment."
"32","A relaxed and 'informal' culture."
"33","The salary and benefits were very competitive.  The vacation time/paid time-off was excellent.  My immediate manager and his boss both fought for their people instead of for themselves.  Reuters was a large company, and I was at the lower levels where I was shielded from a lot of the politics."
"34","The resilience and financial results of Thomson Tax and Accounting, TTA PS&S, aka, Creative Solution’s (CS) for the last couple of years has provided a job environment that feels secure in these uncertain market times.  The environment at CS is laid back but extremely profession as it comes to our products and deliverables.  Employees of all levels at CS seem to understand the importance of family and a life outside... of work, yet at the same time want to and do deliver excellent services and products.  It is a great place to grow professionally and have the opportunity to learn many aspects of business."
"35","Great benefits, good work / life balance, career growth potential, healthy work environment, great office options including company store, Carabou Coffee, free fruit and milk. There are so many areas of the company that would be good to work for, depending on your skill set and aspirations, it could be the place for you. A big company makes you have to work hard if you have any hope of being promoted. Tuition... reimbursment is great, as well."
"36","Salary and benefits are reasonably good and so is the work/life balance."
"37","Good work/life balance. People from middle management downwards are great at ""keeping the show on the road"" and really dedicated to the product."
"38","Interesting. Good clients, good products. Diverse role and options to study. Room for promotions and flexible working."
"39","Work life balance.  Flextime, and no expectation that ""the best work takes place after five pm"" like there is a lot of places.  Quite a few people, even in senior management, come in early and leave early without it being a career limiting move.  The technology organization is especially competent, and anyone with a good idea that can define the good idea in terms that the technology folks can understand is treated... with respect and sometimes even adulation.  The strategic marketing services organization is bright, strategic, analytical, and continues to be on the cutting edge.  The content operations group and the content technology group are competent professionals led by competent professionals."
"40","A truly global company with excellent journalists, many of whom are truly authorities on the subjects they cover. The quality of the news is very high, but not complacent - the organisation has the self-awareness to be healthily self-critical. The journalists are very committed, simply because most of them could earn more elsewhere. So if they don't like it, they quit. Top management is generally open to innovative... ideas about how to improve things, although bureaucracy can stifle efforts for change, just like anywhere. The culture is open and accepting of diversity. Mistakes tend to be dealt with in a sensible way: acknowledged and investigated enough to avoid repetition, but only punished if they are disastrous, repeated and stupid, or go against the code of conduct.
The recent takeover of Reuters by Thomson has opened up huge opportunities for the business, but also for employees, since we now have a much wider range of job opportunities. It is also giving an fresh impetus to reform of the company, including a much-needed revamp of our products and our editorial systems and a clearing of the cobwebs elsewhere.
There are also opportunities to live and work in places that other companies have hardly even heard of."
"41","No other company in the information industry can match Thomson Reuters breadth and depth of information assets.  The brand is among the world's top 50.  The company is generally supportive of work-life balance and encourages employees to maintain and healthy balance.  Thomson's 'pay-for-performance' culture seems to be carried on to the new organization which is a plus.  Integration of the two firms has been very... smooth for the most part with few bumps.  Overall, there is huge potential for growth and dominance in the next decade as information and the quality of that information grows in importance and demand"
"42","Good work-life balance, decent benefits and nice people. Great choice If you value your non-working hours."
"43","Thomson Reuters is an excellent company for an entry level position or for your first job experience. There are many departments to move around and grab all the knowledge you can. They also, for now, have a decent college tuition program."
"44","Great compensation and large company"
"45","A large corporation with numerous opportunities in a variety of fields. If you want to move around, you would certainly have a wide range of lateral and vertical paths available."
"46","Depending on your position, the salary can be very competitive. Benefits are decent. Training - if you have time for it -- is pretty good. Availability and use of technology was great."
"47","The people were friendly. The company recent;y merged with Reuters so it is a global company. The company is based all over the world. The company has many different occupations. The company has good products, and the customer service is excellent. It also is a company that is not in danger of going bankrupt. It's a billion dollar company. It also has a good brand name. That is identifiable to a lot of people."
"48","Employ many people. They hire entry level. Gives benefits."
"49","The project is very challenge and you can always find a place to apply some new stuffs."
"50","The benefits are great, especially for folks grandfathered into the pension plan. Management isn't horrible, and professional level employees are granted a great deal of respect and consideration.
Senior management is often accessible, approachable, and down to earth. Employees at many levels of the organization often have the opportunity to build a rapport or working relationship with them, from what I have seen....
In my experience, I have found that there are a lot of great people at every level of the organization."
"51","Thomson Reuters is a well known and respected company.  They offer good benefits and compensation and a nice environment to work"
"52","Great adherence to strong values in helping to inform 1B people around the world each day. It feels good, and people deeply care. The company also has good benefits in areas, reflecting its European roots. At the same time, people are driven, and there's a supportive culture. Management is savvy, although it can work harder at offering more transparency to employees. It can be hard to see what's going on at the top... at times. The culture is also somewhat risk-averse, stemming from the traditional (and valuable) trust principles that drive Reuters, but management is receptive to innovative ideas if people want to run with them."
"53","Thomson in Eagan has a great culture, great people, and many interesting business problems to solve from a technology perspective.  There is a lot of collaboration between many departments from NPD to West Tech to the data center and with customer service.  I really do enjoy the work and actually look forward to my job on a regular basis."
"54","Work / life balance is a plus.  Company has advancement opportunities in pockets of the organization.  Company is stable and profitable.  Systems and processes are fairly well-defined.  Some very stong senior leaders."
"55","They allow flexible work time, work from home is allowed."
"56","Its a big and stable company, with good exposure to talented people, functional and technical expertise. Comparable salaries, and good work ethics."

"58","Great company brand. Excellent journalistic content."
"59","Very Family Friendly - They allow one to work from home if needed, especially because of family of children.  As a large company, you have the security of knowing they should be around a while."
"60","There is a great balance between work and life - managers understand that life happens. Also, there is great chemistry with coworkers - always willing to answer questions and assist when needed, awesome support from management to assist in career advancement. they are willing to discuss with you what your career options and goals are, and even recommend career development strategies to achieve these goals."
"61","Relaxed work environment...no need to dress fancy, shave, etc.  Also the people are very friendly and there are some good benefits such as tickets to games, events, and access to the gym."
"62","They are a fair employer and reward those that deserve to be so. The company is on the large side which has its benefits. The company cares about its employees and has done a very good job integrating the two companies."
"63","Global company with good worldwide presence, and well-known brand. Talented people."
"64","Great brand and respect from customers. Thomson Reuters is a good place to work, but not and overly aggressive environment, so if you want to make money, other companies are better.  But, if you need a safe place to work, this would be a good choice."
"65","Benefits are above average, even after the merger of Reuters and Thomson Financial."
"66","The people at Thomson Reuters are some of the brightest and most hard working people I have ever worked with in my professional career. The atmosphere is one of teamwork and perseverance and the achievements are promptly recognized."
"67","It's a large company with many resources when it chooses to use them. Fairly secure job during slow economic times. It's such a conglomerate of disconnected aquired companies that it is somewhat disfunctional. Too many Executives speaking board room eze instead of listening and communicating at all levels of the business."
"68","Thomson Reuters is a globally recognized company which is on the cutting edge of nearly every industry we service."
"69","Reuters used to have a very laid back culture. It will be interesting to see how this changes as the merger progresses."
"70","I feel i have good opportunity for growth.  I am rewarded for my efforts through special bonuses (sometimes big - sometimes small) and I feel I am appreciated by my management.  I am given many opportunities to learn and grow more."

"75","Diversity, Good Benefit and Quality of life"
"76","It is really good to work for such a well known company. There are many opportunities for growth and advancement.

"77","Wide range of technologies and business opportunities, great environment to work in, great people, empowerment, challenging business climate"
"78","Flexibility in timings, option to work from home, laptop, broadband etc are provided to work from home"

"80","If you need time off for personal and or sick leave, then the firm is pretty good about giving it to you."
"81","Strong business (on the Professional side) providing growth opportunities for those willing to put in the work.  Great workplace education programs to compliment core skills.  Great work/life balance policies and benefits."
"82","Thomson Reuters is a very flexible and opportunistic company. It is very family focused and willing to accommodate various lifestyles.  There are many programs available to aid its employees on balancing worklife with family life."
"83","Can make decent money if you hit quotas.  However the company decides to raise quotas by 10-12% every year because that is the growth they have promised corporate.  They do this without taking into account that the market is very competitive and that they haven't come up with new solutions/products that will lead to the new growth they want.  This leads people to try and be creative in the way they make thei... ""number"", which is reviewed ad nauseum by managers on a daily and weekly basis."
"84","They understand that you have a life outside of work.  Especially understanding about being a working mom"
"85","Location, Environment, nice flowers, amenities, spacious cubes"
"86","Benefits were fairly good and not too costly.  I was happy with variety you could choose from for medical, dental, and 401k benefits."
"87","Good co-workers and immediate managers, important work, stable employer, benefits package OK, management appreciates and rewards your hard work, upper management communicates vision pretty well.  It's a name that will look nice on your resume."
"88","The company has a great name to those who do not work there.  It will look great on a resume but it is not a place to work for an entire career.  It is possible that the majority of the company is great, however, my part, the inside sales department is less than desirable."
"89","Good holiday package, discounted share plan."
"90","Offers good employee benefits, better than other multinational companies; certain departments maintain good professional and personal relationships."
"91","Opportunities for advancement and for professional growth:  An ever-changing environment can mean great opportunities for the savvy employee who can identify a need that he/she can fulfill. Getting access to decision makers is key to moving up. Market yourself or build relationships with those who have the ear of senior managers. If you are not satisfied with your job, change your role to meet your needs or seek out... projects that let your strengths show. Talk to your managers (or who you want to be your manager) about your career goals. If you are a valuable employee, they will get the hint that you are not happy and they will want to make you happy so you will stay."
"92","TR has quite generous vacation time off and also good health care benefits. The people that you work with are generally very nice and it is a quiet and low-stress work environment for the most part."
"93","Thomson West has had a reputation for loyalty to its employees and a company with career growth opportunities. They have invested in their IT growth and are poised to be a competitive option for software developer talent. The employees are pleasant and seem to enjoy working there. There is somewhat of a family feel there, maybe that's because Thomson West has a lot of married couples working there. There seemed to... have been generations of families that have come through the Eagan office. I thinks that is a holdover from the early days it was West Publishing. Thomson has made its campus employee-friendly by providing services such as dry cleaning, etc."
"94","Flexible schedule suits my personal needs at this time"
"95","Great technologies to work with"
"96","If you want experience working in the financial services industry, this is a good place to get experience. They are a technology focused company. A good place to learn new technologies. The technology management is awful, but if you can work in spite of poor management, you can succeed."
"97","There is an amazing commaraderie between co-workers and colleagues. We also have a contniuous exposure to technology which is inviting. The entreprenural environment encourages creativity and innovation. Overall, the working relationships which turn into long time friendships and the overall corporate culture of innovation and commaraderie are the reasons why you stay as long as you do."
"98","It has a great culture and environment.  The office (in Denver) is very laid back.  Micromedex is a tech company at heart so much of the traditional positive traditional tech attributes exist here - casual dress, low stress, employee perks.  I worked in the finance group and came from a financial services background.  This was almost culture shock for me."
"99","Stability of the company and I work in an area that is in growth mode"
"100","My job is exactly what I want to do. I love the freedom of my flexible schedule. I love working with clients and building relationships with them."
"101","Because the company is so diversified it has weathered much of the recent turmoil.  Good opportunities within the organization if seeking career change."
"102","Salary above average, great benefits"
"103","If you can get 'in' with the management and play office politics there are lots of opportunities.  Good vacation time and decent benefits.  Location of the Times Square office is great."

"108","decent working conditions and benefits"
"109","Big Company benefits and no financial problems"
"110","Large with (theoretical) room for advancement.  Management is generally very competent and approachable.  The company goals are clear, and the company genuinely seems to value long term survival more than simply making next quarter's stock price go up.  Employees are truly considered an asset, not a liability."
"111","Great products; respected, well-known name; financially stable; some wonderful employees. This is a company that has some very useful products and a strong demand. Lawyers get great benefit from using Westlaw and the books West publishes."
"112","working at Thomson provides one with a great opportunity to grow career by making internal transfers and promotions regularly. on the downside, there is not much training and much of the senior management seems to be in a constant churn"
"113","Balanced personal / work life, time off for emergencies. Seems to be a pretty stable company. Start out with 3 weeks vacation which is nice. Health benefits are okay but pricey."
"114","Premier name in the industry; technologically savvy company; customers easily understand the value of products; willing to invest in products and services for the future."
"115","Th entire department worked very well together despite having differing opinions and conflicting motivations.  The message throughout upper management was consistent and gave a clear understanding of the direction  we were going."
"116","The culture at Thomson Reuters is one of the best I have ever experienced, with good balance between the level of expected results and high professionalism while respecting staff, instilling a fun workplace environment with an real emphasis on teamwork and working for each other."
"117","These observations are specific to the WestLaw division.  The base product (WestLaw) is great and the customer support is excellent.  As a place to work the training is fairly good and the tools for account management and the tech support are very good."
"118","exciting job, good support staff, fair pay, smart peers"
"119","As an intern I barely got to scratch the top of what the sales force at Thompson is all about. But I didn't learn a lot about sales and Thompson.  They take care of their employees and have a very positive corporate culture. Lots of perks."
"120","Fun place to work, great benefits, and they are very leinent about allowing time off.  For the most part mamangement is good and they compensate you well for most jobs"
"121","With Thomson Reuters, you always know where your product came from, what the market is, and how your efforts impact the end result. You get to work with a spectacular fusion of wisdom from seasoned software development veterans, and ingenuity from the more recent hires and college grads. The culture is well balanced, and everyone gets a seat at the table. Synergies don't stop at the conference room door. When I walk... the halls, I see friends, not just co-workers. Diversity is encouraged, and design reviews always come with multiple approaches, suggestions and refinements. It's a truly mindblowing, exciting experience!"
"122","Benefits are great, discounts, tuition reimbursement, pension.  Great autonomy, especially in the sales force, with the ability to home office.  Good company to have as a ""calling card"" on your resume."
"123","There is a very relaxed atmosphere, not as tense or stressful as other financial companies. 
Bonuses are reasonable up to 15% and determined by your performance. 
A market leader, respected in the industry."
"124","The people that work there are great-- bright, funny and hard working.
Good products."
"125","Oppurtunity for advancement, excellent products, industry leader"
"126","Make the right friends and you can ride their coattails on up to the the top, right past the people more qualified than yourself."
"127","The company is large and has a lot of different opportunties.  It is extremely diverse as more people have foreign accents than not."
"128","I cannot speak for the company as a whole, but I have been very fortunate to work for some of the most knowledgeable and down to earth directors and managers. The company is very understanding and fair to its employees. No micromanagement involved and if you perform well they will completely trust your judgement."
"129","Flexible working time, the team currently working has more towards the cutting edge technology oriented"
"130","TF is a great place for work life balance.  Pay is at average to higher end range.  There are lots of career growth opportunities for a young inexperienced person like a recent college graduate.  Depending on which department you get in, things can vary quite a bit since many are from recent acquisitions.  Working there, there wasn't too much pressure to perform which can be both good and bad.  On one hand it makes... it easy to balance work and family but at the same time you can get mired in doing the same thing for a very long time."
"131","Good benefits
They generally have friendly people
Allow you to keep the perks from travel
Good amount of vacation
Nice office building"

"133","Decent pay and benefits, interesting products, lots of departments and locations if you want to move around. If you get a good boss, it could be okay for a while."
"134","Thomson Reuters uses the most updated technology, making it available to the employees.  The offices are modern and safe. The health insurance during 2009 was the best thing this company had going for it."
"135","Good work/life balance - nobody here is killing themselves at work. 
Ability to work with or at any of numerous offices around the globe.
Compensation is competitive within the industry."
"136","It really does depend on the department and it varies wildly, but I would say generally speaking people are friendly, benfefits are good, family friendly environment. Opportunities to move around geographically."
"137","Huge Co. Some stability if your in the right place.  Benefits are good.  You might be able to move around if you can last. If its your first sales job, good place to learn structure, it's ran like the Army."
"138","Highly profitable company with plenty of resources directed at workers.  Very intelligent, disciplined business goal formation and execution."
"139","Challenging work, resulting in on-the job learning. Management is understanding of family needs. Fair pay. Large Corporation - spread across enough industries to maintain overall stability. Plenty of room to move up in the organization if you are corporate driven(enjoy swimming in the Kool-aid)."
"140","Financially stable, secure company.  Forward thinkers at the highest realms.  Benefits package good.  Outstanding colleagues."
"141","Large business when many career avenues and opportunities.  Family friendly management, relatively competetive pay practices.  Many business units, first in their respective market."
"142","Easy work
Good balance with personal life
Easy to be the smartest person on the floor"
"143","Comments are specific to Legal & Regulatory only.
Excellent compensation for performance but must perform. Cases & Statutes and analytical products are bread & butter for legal marketplace and vastly superior to competition. Generally left alone to perform if your quotas are met"
"144","Good learning path
facing the clients
rewarding
4-week holiday"
"145","Pay reasonably well, if they managers like you. Very talented developers. Among the workers within each group, we tried to create a tight bond."
"146","Good work-life balance, reporters fairly individually empowered, proud heritage"
"147","Like the information they sell, the use data to analyze and gain insights.  I am very pleased to have succeeded amongst very smart and aggressive people."
"148","Good work life balance. 
Descent pay if you have the guts and energy to fight and scratch for it
Managers retarded."
"149","Good benefits, Politically correct culture."
"150","Good benefits.  work life balance.  Primary competiotors are even more poorly run."
"151","Great company with good salary compensation and excellent benefits.  Working in the 7,000 employee Eagan, MN campus gives you access to many internal job postings if you want to move out of your current position.  Many opportunities for advancement if you are ambitious and want to move up in the organization.  Thomson University and other company resources offer many opportunities for learning and professional... development.  Also, the company's physical facility offers many nice amenities."
"152","Thomson Reuters is a global company with offices everywhere, if youre looking to move abroad then its a good oppertunity."
"153","Very well respected company in the area I work in. At an immediate level management is excellent and has an unrivalled knowledge of the market and what is required to succeed."
"154","TR is a very strong technical organization and they invest in IT accordingly.  Market share is strong and their long term strategy could be worse.  Their support of other nations and people is strong but I wish their support of the US was equally as strong."
"155","Seems like a fairly secure company, fairly diversified, 401(k) matching with decent enough funds."
"156","The people made it a great place to be, however, it was a difficult place to bring about change and ultimately frustrating."

"160","Thomson Reuters is a great company to work for and after being here for 10 years I stil respect and love the company and what the businesses it has. They are flexible and allow you to have a healthy balance between work and your social life. People are friendly and you can work on some great projects."
"161","Most folks get along, good working environment. Depends on your role I think like any other large company, but sales people get paid pretty well. Even junior sales jobs will eclipse $100,000 and top earnings can break $300,000/annually. Also good to be working for the leader in the space, especially as a salesperson."

Some of the products are phenomenal, and even when your product shouldn't otherwise be in the mix for... consideration, sometimes you'll still be in the mix.

"3256","I'm a technology person, working for a company that sells information products to professionals. In my area of the company, those professionals are lawyers. So a lot of what I do revolves around automating the drudgery involved in the practice of law. There are a lot of lawyers and legal editors that work for TR and many of the reviews on the company come from them. But there are also a lot of technology people in... the company working within a very large technology organization.

I've been with TR for almost 10 years and in that time have had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of information processing systems. TR has the most complex systems space I've ever encountered, so much so that it's very hard to get the lay-of-the-land when coming into the company. Documentation is hit-or-miss and like many places I've worked, getting the full story on a particular system requires talking to the right people. With the advent of a new internal company web site - ""theHub"" - finding those people is much easier than it used to be.

TR is big on culture and recently rolled out across-the-board training on values and culture in the workplace. Much of it is obvious stuff but it's nice that the company is investing in making sure everyone knows how to conduct themselves in the work place, understands the basics of human nature, and understands that acting with a certain level of sincerity and trust is important.

The benefits are average, in large part due to cost cutting constantly chipping away at benefits and pay. Some of it reaches the level of absurdity and employee morale at times suffers. Attrition has recently become a problem as the local (and national) job market improves and folks go looking for greener pastures. One of the frustrating decisions from upper management is that senior positions will not be back filled. Instead, new grad hires will be brought in as a way to keep head count steady and cut costs. Like with all companies, every time a senior employee leaves they take a wealth of knowledge and experience with them.

The Rochester office is almost a company-within-a-company with a culture all its own. The mother ship (at least for the legal division) is in Eagan MN and it's there that most of the high-level decisions come from. It's also where most of the big-company, do-it-by-the-book, corporate attitude resides. But I must say, at least in the technology division, there's also some real human compassion for the worker bee and their importance in getting things done.

The people in the Rochester office are terrific. The tech folks are among the best and brightest I’ve ever worked with. The legal folks are great too, but I can’t speak to the work environment they deal with. I know they’ve had to deal with down-sizing and cost cutting changes that have affected their quality of work life. One of the best things about the Rochester office, in my opinion, is the flexibility in work hours that the management team allows. Workers with young families can adjust their hours to accommodate school events, sick kids, etc. Working from home on occasion is also permitted which further enhances the flexibility options.

All in all, my experience at TR has been positive and I would encourage anyone thinking of working here to give it serious consideration."

Although I specialize in a particular area, there is... good exposure to a wide variety of financial data and tools. I periodically work on projects across multiple departments, and I have found most co-workers to be helpful and not territorial.  

As many have mentioned, the benefits are very good. Generous vacation+sick days+volunteer days, 4% matching 401(k), decent health benefits (but used to be better), flexible hours and work from home (depending on position).

Carswell employees have access to Thomson University, a collection... of free online courses for employees only.

If this is your idea of a good employer, they provide a lot of job stability (with some recent exceptions), nice offices, stress-free (albeit not always objectively good) benefits and a recognisable name on your CV. If you stay for a while, they will promote you into various job titles which will... sound good at dinner parties. 
If you get a good sales patch you will hit consistent 100% every year. You still won't earn as much as elsewhere, but you will probably get more job satisfaction and sense of achievement that way.
I don't know much about the life outside of sales, but it looks like people stay for a while and are generally happy, but all in all slightly underpaid.

This is the kind of company that will really take care of you if you happen to get a long-term sickness or other unfortunate life events. There are some amazing redundancy packages to be had too.

All said and done, this is not a bad place to try to start a career. Especially if you're a college grad that doesn't have any better options. The barrier of entry is low. They prefer a college education but anyone who has relevant experience has a shot depending on how desperate they are.

A standard PTO/Sick time system. So better than most in the US. They have an amazing community service program that... gives employees the opportunity to take time off to volunteer and get your non-profit a grant.

For your first year, the work is very easy. It seems hard at first, but it gets progressively easier. It will get harder after you start learning more product lines but then eventually plateau. And once you know it, you know it. I often heard the seniors telling new reps, “You are not expected to know everything.” Once you embrace that, the job becomes less stressful.

A safe, diverse environment. There is a menagerie of different types of people on this floor. You will find your tribe.

The possibility to advance within the company. And once you get out of your initial role, it’s easier to keep moving. There has been 30 or more job opportunities available consistently in the Ann Arbor location since I started.

Best training/onboarding I’ve ever experienced in the workplace. Before you even start, you get put into a month long training with a cohort of people. The camaraderie I built with this group lasted the entire time I was at this company. The training itself gives you enough context in a product to find answers you don’t know. I felt like I barely knew the product when I first started on the phones. This is normal. Don’t expect to feel secure at first, but there are processes in place to help new reps.

Have an issue with something we do at the company? The people in charge love feedback and I have seen good suggestions get implemented quickly. You are empowered to make change and contribute. Most team leaders are also knowledgeable and can guide your career in the right direction. The support leadership is aware of the issues the department faces and I think they really do care and try to make things better. It's easy for us peasants to criticize, but navigating that Kafkaesque bureaucracy is a full-time job on its own. They are far more limited than you would think and some of the suggestions I heard from fellow reps would literally implode the department."

Em relação as horas extras, elas não acabaram, mas melhorou bastante, os gestores que antes pediam para fazer horas e horas extras, agora se mostram um pouco mais preocupados com o excesso de trabalho fora do horário (por mais que ainda existam pessoas trabalhando em publicações no final de semana).
