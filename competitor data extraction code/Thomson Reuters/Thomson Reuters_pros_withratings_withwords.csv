a empresa mudou bastante nos últimos meses acredito que pelo fato de muitas pessoas terem saído foi feito um plano de retenção onde muitas pessoas foram promovidas e ou ganharam um aumento para equiparar com o mercado acredito que esse movimento precisa continuar para reter seus talentos e atingir a aqueles que não tiveram a oportunidade de serem reconhecidos em relação a gestão na minha opinião teve uma boa melhora parece que os gestores tem sido mais transparentes com o que acontece ao invés de negligenciar fatos no intuito de manter seus colaboradores motivados em relação as horas extras elas não acabaram mas melhorou bastante os gestores que antes pediam para fazer horas e horas extras agora se mostram um pouco mais preocupados com o excesso de trabalho fora do horário por mais que ainda existam pessoas trabalhando em publicações no final de semana a parte de cultura da empresa que antes não existia agora está acontecendo tem acontecido vários eventos e ações para melhorar o ambiente e a cultura da empresa minha percepção da empresa nos últimos meses melhorou bastante as vezes me sindo um pouco desconfortável com certas situações porém vejo um movimento onde os responsáveis pela empresa estão buscando melhorar as coisas ,

i m a technology person working for a company that sells information products to professionals in my area of the company those professionals are lawyers so a lot of what i do revolves around automating the drudgery involved in the practice of law there are a lot of lawyers and legal editors that work for tr and many of the reviews on the company come from them but there are also a lot of technology people in the company working within a very large technology organization i ve been with tr for almost years and in that time have had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of information processing systems tr has the most complex systems space i ve ever encountered so much so that it s very hard to get the lay of the land when coming into the company documentation is hit or miss and like many places i ve worked getting the full story on a particular system requires talking to the right people with the advent of a new internal company web site thehub finding those people is much easier than it used to be tr is big on culture and recently rolled out across the board training on values and culture in the workplace much of it is obvious stuff but it s nice that the company is investing in making sure everyone knows how to conduct themselves in the work place understands the basics of human nature and understands that acting with a certain level of sincerity and trust is important the benefits are average in large part due to cost cutting constantly chipping away at benefits and pay some of it reaches the level of absurdity and employee morale at times suffers attrition has recently become a problem as the local and national job market improves and folks go looking for greener pastures one of the frustrating decisions from upper management is that senior positions will not be back filled instead new grad hires will be brought in as a way to keep head count steady and cut costs like with all companies every time a senior employee leaves they take a wealth of knowledge and experience with them the rochester office is almost a company within a company with a culture all its own the mother ship at least for the legal division is in eagan mn and it s there that most of the high level decisions come from it s also where most of the big company do it by the book corporate attitude resides but i must say at least in the technology division there s also some real human compassion for the worker bee and their importance in getting things done the people in the rochester office are terrific the tech folks are among the best and brightest i ve ever worked with the legal folks are great too but i can t speak to the work environment they deal with i know they ve had to deal with down sizing and cost cutting changes that have affected their quality of work life one of the best things about the rochester office in my opinion is the flexibility in work hours that the management team allows workers with young families can adjust their hours to accommodate school events sick kids etc working from home on occasion is also permitted which further enhances the flexibility options all in all my experience at tr has been positive and i would encourage anyone thinking of working here to give it serious consideration ,"people, company, culture, management, home, cutting, senior, work, benefits, hours, environment, great, working"
