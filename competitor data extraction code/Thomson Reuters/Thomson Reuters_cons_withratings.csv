There is one God. And it’s name is Phone Queue, which for brevity we will now call Q. Your whole life will be structured around Q. Notice I say life, and not day. Q determines when you can leave work. Q determines when you can take PTO. Q determines if you get to work on the other projects/assignments you have. Q even has power over when you eat, which is ironic, as it is ever hungry. Q does not care if you vomit... on your coworker's desk or you have to take your spouse to the hospital. Q only cares about its daily pound of human flesh. Q can be merciful, but only if sated by the blood and tears of your fellow employees.

I’ve been told there was a legendary time when program updates didn’t break the software you are supporting. The documentation from that time is still recorded on the stone walls within the smoker’s gazebo, chiseled in Ancient Sumerian. I think we were allowed to wear shorts back then, too.

Some managers are better than others. This is common in all companies, but it does seem that some employees end up getting fired who would have made it on other teams. I’ve heard of insane micromanaging where every blip of inactivity is questioned and others have “allegedly” been cussed out, but I never experienced that personally.

This job is often touted as a “foot in the door” for the rest of the company. This is solely dependent on our Dear Leader, Q. I saw multiple reps with applicable skills who got offered internships/opportunities in other departments get denied because Q couldn’t afford to let them go. In one of those scenarios, the rep knew only one product at the time so they would have only impacted one part of Q out of 20+ parts. This implies to me that these dangled opportunities will rarely happen. The foot in the door metaphor would be more accurate if they added “if pigs fly”, or even better, change the phrasing to “a foot in your rear to help you out the door”. In the company's defense, I understand the business reasoning behind not letting reps work in other departments, but the majority of those reps I mentioned earlier left and got jobs in their field at different companies after 2+ years of training at the company's expense. Such a waste. 

—
There is a high ceiling for advancement in this department. It is not impossible and once you’ve broken your chains, it gets easier to keep doing so. But just realize you will be competing against 50+ internal people per job posting. It’s not uncommon for someone completely unexpected (ie. they’re rather new) to get chosen for a role, but this would be a negative for the people who don’t get the job and have based their entire career on getting to that position. This is balanced by situations where they already have someone in mind for the role, but tell all the other applicants that they stand a good chance so they can get enough applicants to have the illusion that this was an unbiased process. This leads to a two week to two month process of interviewing where they’ll still go with the person everyone knew was going to get the job in the first place. These very common scenarios create a lot of uncertainty and resentment about promotions in the department which is channeled towards the company. The salt in the support department is real, and no amount of free food or lego stations can wash it away. To be fair, the interview process has always been inherently broken. You can’t tell if an applicant is going to be good at a role after looking at a piece of paper inflating their accomplishments, having a 45 min conversation where you ask about hypothetical scenarios that may or may not be relevant to the role, and where you get answers that may not even be true and can’t be verified. It’s absurd, and it’s best to revel in that absurdity. Otherwise you’ll lose your mind and start throwing coins into the urinals and wiping your snot on the bathroom walls. (The chaotic interview structure is probably common in other companies as well, but I don’t know if Thomson Reuters should be proud to be a part of that swamp.)

You need to make a plan for what you want from the company as soon as possible. Not all product knowledge is valuable and applicable to other jobs. After mastering the customer service soft skills there is not much left to learn except for additional products. The issue is that these additional products will not necessarily help you advance to other parts of the company. It may help with some product specific roles and it will help you advance in the Support department, but if your interests lie elsewhere then it’s not worth it. Learning as many products as possible seems like a good way to get ahead. This is a trap. You will have a less flexible schedule with more stress for the same pay as everyone else. There is not one job that requires that many product knowledge bases (possibly Training/Consulting but even then I doubt you would be supporting everything). Those with IT aspirations should learn GFR, Web, and all the Systems. Those with an eye on a Development role should look at what products will have the most demand, generally a tax product or products in development. Professional Services tends to find more value with people who know GFR. Getting into the Operations or Content team requires some experience doing their work/job duties, which is only offered to those with passable metrics and product knowledge, and manager approval. Sales will look at anyone with some experience with sales. The reason this section is in the Cons, is that your manager or Operations can throw you into a training at-will, which can derail your career plan or give you irrelevant work which gives you less time to do things that will actually have an impact on your future. I see perfectly good reps with solid metrics start to flounder when they get overburdened or disillusioned. These reps usually leave in any way possible (ie. MyPay).

A silver bullet mentality. Everything looks like a nail when you just got a hammer. This is especially apparent with the company’s attempt to turn every team into one based around Agile. Agile makes more sense in an Agile role where there is a finished Agile product rather than in a call-center environment. If I had heard the word Agile one more time, I was going to Agile myself out the second floor window. But the big man in the big chair championing the system said that this will allow the company to save more money and stop the hemorrhaging of the department, so obviously they are an informed, innovative thinker. You could also try sending him your credit card information and social security number and he’ll send you back a routing number for a Nigerian bank. Expect to hear industry buzzwords all the time with people nodding their head in excitement. But don’t look into anyone’s eyes when they do it. They’ll be black and lifeless, like a doll’s eyes. You know how you can tell when you’re in their meeting, Chief? When you hear them say blockchain unironically."
"183","—
I don’t believe the company should be going for the quality of employees that they’ve been looking for. Hiring people out of college or people with options is currently a bad business strategy for this department and role. Anyone who has the skills or resources to leave, or the motivation to get them, see the writing on the wall within the first six months. They give themselves a time limit for advancement and... then move on if that limit is surpassed. Why is that your problem? You waste $4-5k training someone who has no intention of staying.  Their replacement gets paid a months salary before doing any real work to learn a fraction of what that rep knew and whom may also not have any intention of staying. 

—
Work life balance is key to your retention. As soon as a rep feels like they’ve been assigned too many products, they leave making it worse for everyone else who then also consider leaving. And the word on the street is that our beloved big brothers in Operations are doublethinking the data in the opposite direction from which things will get better. But don’t worry, we still love them!

—
Teach reps more applicable skills. Yes, that might make retention worse, but someone may stay longer if they feel they are learning something valuable from it. The Aspiring Supervisor program is a step in the right direction. Maybe extend that format to other departments or teach more useful IT skills. 

—
The company has a staff utilization issue. Overly cross-training reps spreads the problem out to other products in the Q. The plan to reduce project time across the board will decrease retention and morale, as reps need reassurance that they may one day escape the drudgery that is their existence. New hires seem like an expensive gamble, especially with the current retention rate. It’s a difficult problem, and it’s above me. Maybe have some reps only learn low call volume Qs but have them learn them all instead of cross-training them in a product that will completely negate their previous trainings.

HR and Leaders that conducts interview need to be more proactive about communicating what stage of the process an interviewee is at. The lack of communication is what soured my opinion of this company the most. I went from a bright-eyed new rep trying to contribute anything I could to making other employees laugh at dark, inappropriate jokes about TR’s problems, after only two such interview experiences. I would rather be told to my face that I didn’t get the job, then get ghosted for 6 months while noticing that the job got reposted two times since the interview. Only about half of the hiring managers I’ve talked to have reached out with feedback, and I respect the ones that did all the more for it."

MY ADVICE: prioritize professionalism.

Top performers do most of the work, while the inept/lazy/manipulators continue to slide and hardly do any work because they  ride the coattail of their superiors who protect them. Silos (I did not know this word until I started working here). Company recently... and still is going restructuring/reorganization: I was excited about this, and perhaps the toxic culture, because of incompetence, blind, and power-hungry supervisors, will be eliminated. However, those who know how to play politics and attach themselves to power and grovel to the power-hungry remain and continue to make decisions to further their personal and political interests instead of benefiting the company or their customers, the latter part being the company's focus -- customer-centric but is not being met. Company keeps moving to automate and outsource jobs and positions to the point that the remaining people are themselves ""automated"", that is they just plod through work like a zombie or a robot. Also gerrymandering -- the abuse of power and authority  manipulating boundaries. Management needs to stop being firefighters (a crisis/""fire"" they, unbeknownst to them, themselves are creating because of their recalcitrant mindset) and move into more of agile and proactive mindset. Upper management touts customer experience and employee engagement. Every action they take is not focused on either, all just talk. Mismanagement at all levels especially at manager supervisor level. Those in charge want to make their poor decisions the fault of remaining employees of not working hard enough and saying yes often.  Culture also is where any dissent is discouraged. And they are trying to create a culture of being young -- mostly young are hired and retained while the seniors with experience and are industry experts are let go (unless, again, you're one of these incompetent seniors who have just been gliding through the work hardly doing any work except kissing their superior's be-hind)."

Some of the top sales contributors at both the manager and individual contributor level were let go last year regardless of the dollars they brought in and a record year for sales numbers.  Not many of remaining... employees understood the rationale.  Some people that have never led sales orgs talked their way into leading large sales teams and the results are hitting TR hard in 2019.

Embora seja uma empresa multinacional, no Brasil é gerenciada como uma pequena empresa local, por pessoas que não conhecem e não tem experiencia em... grandes corporações. Como em termos de Revenue o Brasil não possue grande representatividade, a matriz não dedica muito tempo a olhar como as coisas acontecem por aqui.

"819","There's some downsides, probably typical of large public corporations.  There seems to be a tendency to make decisions driven by more immediate stockholder expectations rather than what's necessarily best for the company. 

For example, there were quite a few layoffs while I was there, with a couple of pretty disruptive outsourcing reorganizations. I assume supposedly to save payroll expense, but at what other... cost to the business in terms of lost knowledge and expertise.  

In recent years, the focus is on moving the entire company to an ""enterprise"" organization, creating enterprise shared services support groups, and trying to standardize systems and processes across many varied business units. Therefore, change can be slow b/c every project has to be considered in terms of how it fits into the enterprise plan.  I'm guessing certain specific departments and business units are able to respond to change more quickly and less bureaucratically.  But those are likely to be the outlying areas and not the areas that are central to the company's success.

So, in those core areas, there's been some pain and frustration with that. But they seemed to be getting there, and once they do I think they should be able to adapt and respond more quickly. But it's still going to be a pretty big ship to turn.  So, will have to see."

While you say that we will be shifting from a product based approach to a customer based approach, you have to realize that a vast majority of our... clients are product based clients.

New ideas for improvement were regularly criticized and you ended up feeling like it's just better to put your head down and accept the process as is.  Success there wasn't about the work you do but how well you can create a PowerPoint about the... work you do (truth in the PowerPoint is optional).  They also had a tendency to play musical chairs with leadership.  When things were going bad, the leadership would shuffle and it was billed as a ""new"" change to drive innovation.  The tone on this seems to be changing with the recent buy out but there's a lot of cultural change needed to undo the damage of the previous leadership.  Finally, there's a massive lack of transparency from leadership.  As an example, on one call, you'll be told the sales numbers are awesome.  Two hours later, you'll be in another call and the numbers were awful - usually that call related to setting expectations on  your bonus.  It was always a struggle to figure out how (and where) we were succeeding with the leadership taking constantly varied stances on performance."
"1058","I was told by my manager that though I am a minority, I wouldn't ""look like it in a picture"".  By itself that doesn't bother me but be aware that diversity isn't about hiring people for a picture.  

People were so afraid of the backlash from being honest in employee surveys that you're not getting the feedback you need to truly change.  It's just something that has to change to get people more engaged.

Year after year layoffs, and re-organizations over the past decade (and in many cases longer), and a constant perceived ""do more with less"" attitude from management, which makes for a extremely difficult environment to... work in at times, and has, in many cases, done much more harm than good for efficiency of the various businesses in the company.  Most employees I worked with can, without hesitation, name various tasks and processes that took minutes or hours to do, which now take days, weeks or months to complete.  From their perspective, it's due to so many experienced people being laid off from the company, and in a lot of cases, tasks being moved to a 3rd party, or being given to new hires right out of college who have no idea about the existing structure of the company, and are constantly recreating the processes over from scratch."
"1187","Thomson Reuters employees all understand change is necessary, but I would advise that the constant layoffs and re-orgs should be slowed down so the remaining people left at the company can properly absorb the changes, and so management can truly see if the changes they are making are having the desired effect.  My experience over the last 3 or 4 years at the company involved a lot of scrambling from various teams... trying to just get by after experienced people were let go in rapid succession year after year.  Much of this was done to cut expenses in the short term, but no one in management or finance ever appears to take into account the vast delays and issues caused by these actions, and the impact to the existing revenue streams, and the ability to develop new products for customers."

It can take too long for promising young talent to get the opportunities they need to move up the organisation and gain greater responsibility and remuneration. Remuneration does not grow as fast as your market value or skillset!

As people get more senior they can get stuck managing more and more staff and looking after the same technology – there is not always the... organisational flexibility (e.g. comfort that backfill will be approved) to move talent sideaways around the organisation.

The company is going through significant upheaval at the moment as it splits into two organisations – Refinitiv (a private company, mainly financial technology focus) and Thomson Reuters (a public company, professional information for lawyers and tax accountants, as well as the Reuters news agency and associated media).

Family business.  Managers are here to grow, not to make the team grow. Team grows in size, but not in learning. Few managers want to control everything. Subject matter experts have nothing to say. Whatever manager say are final... though  they are not SMEs in everything. They make your life hell, Many people had similar experience and left, I am just ignoring them - so that I can live.

I do know that fact that - irrespective of how much healthier I am and loving the work I do, these fixed income managers have the capacity to kill someone through 'stress-induced-health-issues' like heart attach. I only hope that  senior managers take a note of this feedback one day - may be after I become a victim of such stress-induced-heart-attack.

I would have given 5****** if fixed income managers were human. unfortunately, they are not."

Though working in F&R, I saw no culture of consultative decision-making (whereby direct reports are asked for views) amongst senior or middle management. I spent four years there and was not once asked for my input on what tools/vendors we should use, what our team's macro-strategy should be etc. As an analyst, I would have expected more requests for insight-driven... recommendations (to be clear, I did provide content and digital marketing recommendations as part of my core responsibilities; I'm talking about lack of consultation re team direction, tools etc)

Secondly, the office culture was very drab. It clearly was not a management priority to get people working in same location to socialise or get know one another.

The people in the trenches working with clients are really the life-blood of this company.

A empresa tem um sistema de metas que não funciona, da até preguiça de preencher as metas no começo do ano, porque no final das contas elas não servem de absolutamente nada. Por mais que se faça, é difícil... subir de cargo. A gente trabalha MUITO, eu mesmo já até desacostumei trabalhar 8h por dia, quando trabalho 8h acho que alguma coisa está faltando no meu dia.

"1748","No career progress, impossible to grow within the organisation"
"1749","Work on morale"
"1750","Thomson Reuters is a career cul-de-sac with advancement tied almost exclusively to tenure not talent nor competency. There is a reason there are so few employees in the 3-10 year range as most new employees are either laid off or leave due to lack of advancement opportunity, skill development investment (TR will rarely pay for certifications, technical conferences or outside learning) or regular re-organizations.  I... decided to leave the company when I realized they were paying me to become obsolete and the likelihood that I would be laid off without current skills was increasing each quarter. Thomson Reuters’ benefit package keeps most at the company so there’s little motivation to do innovative work and its obvious many employees are just punching a time card.  On numerous occasions, long-tenured employees would simply not do their required work with little fear or repercussions yet still receive yearly salary increases and bonuses. As a new employee, expect to have to pick up the slack in order to receive a good performance review or prepare yourself to be laid off within 18-24 months (sometimes less depending on your department). Employees with innovative ideas are repeatedly ignored even when the ideas could save the company significant money. 
HR is a complete mess. Internal applications are “lost” or misdirected, job descriptions are altered to fit favorited candidates, position qualifications are wildly misaligned (a manager can be required to have more experience than a director within the same department), and internal advancement is nearly impossible without patronage. Nepotism is rampant – remember job descriptions and positions are often created to fit the background of leaders’ former business partners or coworkers. I personally witnessed this on multiple occasions despite HR “requirements” about diverse candidate boards and internal consideration. I was lied to, in writing, on multiple occasions by two different HR representative about internal opportunities yet my complaint to the HR ethics hotline went unanswered in both instances and the hiring leader for one position essentially shrugged their shoulders and informed me “that’s how HR is around here.”"
"1751","Pay attention to turnover among new employees as it reflects a chaotic HR situation (and often unethical HR group), no investment in skills development or career advancement opportunities.  Current leaders are violating HR policy by offering positions with known conflicts of interest and HR employees are behaving unethically. All of your talk of culture and inclusion is moot when this continues."
"1752","Quota, can be a challenge to hit."
"1753","Thanks for all you do"
"1754","Unfortunately TR is not that competitive when it comes to salary."
"1755","Yet to find so. For me as an fresher when i started my job, i felt it was great opportunity and platform to start wth."
"1756","On boarding process was disorganized 
Little training for the job. Sometimes management has a ‘figure it out yourself’ approach and attitude towards training and they don’t offer much guidance. Possibly because they have no clue themselves.

Good old boys attitude 
Not open to new ideas
Discrimination 
Upper management makes decisions that don’t work and they don’t get feedback from employees doing the work!
HR is only concerned about the company-harassment is allowed and not stopped!
They do not protect the employees 
You get labeled as “do not like change” when you suggest a better way of doing something. 
Cutting of staff so... current workers jobs double with no benefit increase making it hard to do a quality job
Employees who are good at brown nosing but don’t do a good job are rewarded while good employees suffer."
"1851","Before you implement changes, make sure they’ll work!  Get employees involved that actually do the job. Things may look good on paper but in reality don’t work-this was a constant issue in my 14 years of working there!  
LISTEN to your employees!
To avoid lawsuits, HR should be for the good of the company AND the EMPLOYEES- right now it’s onesided-company only. 
Replace management at the top. If upper management... allows harassment, discrimination, no lower employees input, etc, it creates an unhealthy employee environment."
"1852","TR has always been in a constant state of change (tinkering is a more accurate description) however the Blackstone announcement is seismic in comparison and has created an awful lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt.  The brain drain has started and in some cases welcomed."

I didn't receive my pc the first two to three weeks, and when I did I had to set it up myself. No help from the IT department. Like, why do we need to call a General Help Desk to setup things that are a necessity. 

Training: 
I needed to ask friends that... do not work for the company to help me with training material. There are a  couple of people which  have all the knowledge of certain applications and do not want to share it. We do have a great  source of help that is called ""The Hub"" but it is not being used correctly. I mentioned to management how this tool can be beneficial because I came from a company that was using it EXTREMELY well.  Instead, there are other tools that are used."
"1859","TR is a great company. However, the old ways things are handled are not what is being used today. The Hub should be something where employees should share internal knowledge to other employees within their department not KBI Articles.  Onboarding should be a huge focus for all new employees, if new employees do not receive the tools they need the rest of the year will be frustrating."

"1905","But they are outnumbered by mediocre foods who have brown-nosed and process- managed their way to seniority.  TR was a news company that created a bureaucracy that rivalled the Chinese communist party with its complexity but achieved far less.

It’s difficult to get around because it is just messy and you need to find things out on your own or with the help of colleagues due to the lack of guidance.

"2099","It is a daunting task to even start thinking of all the possible cons of having worked in EDD. Perhaps it was the department itself that deserves the lowest score, not so much the entire company. Perhaps. Although the bad impressions started early, even before my arrival to my new office. First off: I was flat out mislead during the recruitment process about the post-tax compensation, by about a third of the amount... I was promised per month. I was also mislead that the company is to provide help in finding housing and paying for certain other benefits like health insurance (they do pay it for you, entirely out of your salary!). But I guess these gimmicks have become commonplace. 

There were bigger issues involved within EDD: it is god-forbid disorganized. Mistakes, mistakes everywhere. From day one at relentless frequency, you will deal with errors and mistakes that come from nowhere and from noone in particular. I have worked in a number of offices before, and I could never have imagined that something so disorganized could still run without collapsing on its face. The management, which has been changed from bad to close to non-existent (perhaps, ironically, for the better), was simply not serious. When I did see the only manager come in, on an infrequent occasion, she seemed to have engaged in defending the structural problems that the department had rather than trying to fix them. On the one hand it is understandable that the manager tried to paint an ""optimistic"" picture of how things were, at the same time it is the crucial job of the manager to be able to see past any rosy optimist to figure out the weaknesses of department. It would have been a good start if she at least showed up to work consistently to figure things out. 

In terms of specifics of the issues that EDD suffered (and from what I hear, still suffers), these include: language issues in directions, constantly out of date database management, lack of teamwork, redundant administrative work that EVERY employee must pitch in irrespective if it comes in the middle of his or her other work (quite disruptional), lack of professional respect between both top and bottom, clique-type atmosphere, politics and feudal-style favouritism.  

I simply could not go on working at the place. It looked good on a CV, but the professional development was just too regressive."

Globalement le site de Puteaux est à l'abandon, la direction attend que tout le monde part pour fermer les portes.
Les projets et les powerpoints du Top Management sont de la poudre aux yeux pour justifier leurs salaires démesurés alors que les personnes qui produisent réellement de la valeur... ajoutés sont en sous effectifs.

La boite est plombés par plusieurs générations de personnes qui ont connu la ""grande époque"" avec des augmentations mirobolantes. 
Aujourd'hui les temps sont durs pour une entreprise qui n'est pas leader de son marché et qui n'innove plus faute d'esprits vifs. Les gros salaires restent car ils ne retrouveront jamais un travail aussi bien payé ailleurs.

En étant chez Thomson Reuters j'avais l'impression d'être présent pour faire le nombre dans les équipes et ainsi justifier la présence de certains managers.

1 manager pour deux développeurs, c'est du jamais vu, c'est une hierarchie pyramidale poussée à l'extreme !

Les équipes ne communiquent pas, les développeurs ne voient pas les clients, la rétention d'information est le sport national de l'entreprise.

Bref le management est dépassé et résigné face au manque d'effectif pour travailler dans des conditions normales, pendant que le top management est très content de la situation et espère que cela durera le plus longtemps possible pour manger dans la soupe tant qu'elle est encore bonne.

This permanently impacts on the sales team, as they are... uncertain as to their roles and become indifferent to trying to achieve anything. The systems and processes are so broken that achieving any internal admin tasks is a challenge, and makes the company very difficult to work with from a customer point of view. Its dreary spending every day trying to apologise for known issues, and those issues are never addressed.

If you mentor and encourage your employees, they become better and you should encourage them and give them a push and chance to move on and better their career....

"2886","Very demanding culture.  As employees leave the department, new positions would not be backfilled, ensuring more work for the OMS.  Large amounts of OT was necessary in order to complete work and to meet client needs.  OMS's with large account bases normally cannot go long periods of time without logging in remotely or in office due to the specific nature of account bases (and at irregular hours).  Difficult... work/life balance.   Working inter-departmentally was often a chore & does not always encourage positive relationships (as most departments had their own initiatives and goals, creating a check/balance system).  As an OMS, you work most closely with the sales team, whom (depending on who you work with) can create a less than memorable experience. Recent downsizing of departments made the work environment very competitive.  Upper management is very cliqe-ish, & your moving forward may very likely depend on their opinion of you vs your quality of work.  Ultimately, salary does not match the level of work the OMS must complete on a daily basis.  Career growth opportunities are limited unless you are willing to move to a new city or HQ.  Employees are encouraged to share new ideas, that either fall on deaf ears or Senior Management neglects to follow up on.  As an OMS, you will need to understand and access around 40+ systems internally, pending your task and what you need to accomplish.  Additionally, you are generally the first line of communication to your client, and you will need to help maintain that relationship  along with your long list of additional tasks.  Your experience as an OMS will depend on department needs, versus how you will grow best in your role (example: upon hire, you will join a team that needs you, due to downsizing and lack of replacing those who leave.  You may end up with a smaller account base in middle markets -- which is good for learning and growing -- or you could end up with a very high profile client where the learning curve is extremely steep, but with great exposure in your market)"
"2887","Don't let good talent become disengaged.  Create a plan to reward your talent and help them grow.  Create a better roadmap for growth for the OMS in AND out of Customer Administration.  Encourage knowledge share and idea sharing outside of just team meetings (provide recurring feedback for those ideas).  Although the OMS role is fading away, find more ways to support the employees who choose to stay in the role or... remain with TR during the journey, versus loading them with more work once other individuals leave (this creates a great deal of anxiety and employees wondering if their job will be removed next).  Revisit the plan for how an OMS will grow in a role from day 1, to SOMS status to major high level clients, versus placing them on a team wherever they are needed, creating a very stressed new hire and employees who feel less valued (if they are equally as qualified to fill the place for those large account bases)."

My much smaller company was acquired by Thomson Reuters many years ago, and along with benefits of a large company, there are definite downsides. You really are just a number in the grand scheme of TR.  Over the years there have been numerous rounds of layoffs and offshoring, and I've seen a lot of good people let go.  (On the flip side,... severance packages have generally been good for those employees that are laid off.)

My particular department has shifted from being a high expertise/leading edge content area to commoditized data, and the department has been shrunk and re-aligned numerous times, resulting in increased workloads. Not surprising, this results in lower morale and a bit of cynical attitude, while other priority departments and projects have received significant increases in resources.  That said, layoffs, reorganizations, imbalances in resources, etc. are typical at any very large company. 

Pay increases are minimal, with little flexibility to reward high performers or adjust pay for shifting responsibilities. (Only 1-2.5% each year for the past 10 years. ) Unless you move to a completely different position, you cannot simply renegotiate your salary with your boss.

"3327","Where to start? The near-constant re-orgs are killing this place. It's obvious that the Thomson family regrets its acquisition of Reuters in 2008. They made a mistake buying a firm that was so dependent on the financial services industry at the precise moment that industry was beginning a 10+ year decline. They have global data collection operations that make it impossible to achieve the profit margins required to... make this an attractive acquisition though, so they've been hacking and slashing every few years, under the guidance of one major consulting firm or another. They've all been paid millions -- McKinsey, BCG, etc... -- even after David Craig began loading up senior positions with his consultant friends, who then began hiring all their friends from Oliver Wyman -- who are all great at generating Powerpoints and Excel sheets, not so much on delivering much of anything. Each major re-org (ca. every 3 years) requires a massive shift of attention and focus and ultimately drags motivation down. Nobody is ever held accountable for these horrendous decisions. The latest changes (smaller cuts in late 2015, large cuts late 2016) completely reversed the massive changes made in 2013. Does anyone realize how much time and energy was wasted trying to figure out the operating model from 2013? How much money this actually cost the company? C'mon, there must be at least one so-called ""strategy"" person who can crunch the numbers on this. Why not claw back some senior management bonuses as compensation for these losses? 

Financial & Risk has shifted to the ""ADD strategy"": shift focus and strategy every year, re-brand your efforts internally, generate a new batch of business cases aligned to the new strategy, and then arrive in the new year with the realization that there are not enough resources to deliver on the approved business cases. Everything stagnates. Late Q2 into Q3 it becomes clear that nothing is getting done, and then rumors of the ""new"" re-org start swirling. Play - Stop - Rewind - Play.....Repeat. Have a look on LinkedIn -- see how many people have changed roles every 12-18 months, repeatedly. That's not because they're being promoted based on performance. It's because there are repeated shuffles of strategy and how the organization should achieve it, followed by everyone scrambling to re-brand what it is they're doing to make it sound relevant (and central) to the new strategy. Yawn.

To go along with this, they've been systematically reducing the benefits across the board. They've fine-tuned the commission scheme for sales so that they can keep total payouts reduced, they've eliminated stock bonuses for anyone but the most senior managers, and they've keyed the cash bonuses to metrics that  also guarantee you'll never get full payout. It used to be the case that if your business unit over-performed (ie, exceeded already aggressive targets by 5-15%), those responsible for that were rewarded above your baseline rate. Now that might mean you get 90%-100% of your bonus rate. Actually -- not 100%. Never.

Wait a year and see if they've finally managed to sell off the Financial business, check to see they haven't taken David Craig along with the acquisition, and then see what they're doing. Going in now: you'd just be signing up for one long defensive crouch. And that's not a good way to live your life."
"3328","Sell off the Financial business sooner rather than later, so that the remaining employees can get on with their lives.

Be honest about your strategy. At least be honest to the people responsible for the different products and businesses. The constant smokescreen and shuffling of priorities is ruining the culture you're spending so much money on trying to change.

Get rid of David Craig. He knows nothing about... the products, why our customers use them, and why they might or might not in the future. Don't hire a consultant in his place; get someone who's been building the products for a few decades -- oh yeah, they all were made redundant. There must be someone, find him/her.

Figure out what you're good at and focus on that. Hint: it's not building technology. Take your proprietary data and create value-added products the market needs. Don't believe Powerpoints about market sizing/opportunities that are not backed up by extensive client feedback.

Treat your employees like they're valued partners. It's shameful what you've done over the past 8 years. If there's a culture problem (and there is), it starts here. Surely one of your overpaid senior managers must have learned this in B-school. Or from a book on ""leadership"". Or from having actual experience LEADING a high-performance team, an actual TEAM. That is, a group of people who had each other's backs, who will go to bat for each other, who would suffer individually for the greater good of the group. You can't teach this. You need actual leaders...and you have have so few."
"3329","The bureaucracy of everything and below market pay, just as everyone else says, are the primary cons. It's very Eagan centric, that can be a good or bad thing depending on your situation. No on-site anything good, especially the food. (you can get candy, balloons and dry cleaning on-site."

I left TR 3 years ago. I got out before the first wave of IT outsourcing layoffs hit my department. I cannot say anything bad about the company as a whole, but what I can say is that working in Legal (formerly West Publishing, St. Paul/Eagan, MN) was an interesting experience. The company was completely... different to work for before West Publishing was bought by Thomson, then later Thomson purchased Reuters until we have the conglomerate we see today. Since the merger I saw the company going downhill…wages for employees were less than market average, benefits went downhill, the tuition reimbursement program was cut in half, then cut all together, hiring freezes, promotion freezes, and the discontinuing of the pension program for newly hired employees. TR also divested a large share of their money making divisions…Thomson Learning and Thomson Health. I fear Thomson Legal will be divested soon as well because all of the signs of a failing division are present (see previous notes). Their legal division has been hurt by the failing print business. People do not read books anymore, they want information online. Their Westlaw product, while strong, could not keep up with the revenue enjoyed by their print business for decades. As the internet expanded, print subscriptions lessened. 
From an employee perspective, working at the Eagan, MN (former headquarters of the West Publishing business) location was typical to what you see in many Minnesota based companies…clickiness, ole boy club, subtle racism, and a definite glass ceiling for minority employees. Combine this with the poor financial outlook for this division and I would look elsewhere if you want a career…or even a job that is secure. Working in Eagan, MN was also the most toxic environment I have ever worked in. People were clicky, bigoted, back-stabby, untrustworthy, working in fear under authoritarian leadership models, non-supportive feckless HR, and you are getting paid less than other jobs in the same market.

"3722","I'm new grad who got hired at Thomson Reuters right after I was done with my last undergrad course. I don't think my story would resonate with others who've commented on here very much since I'm based in Bangkok.  
But as the title says, I want to leave the company very soon and I'm only at my 5 months mark! (My probationary period lasts for 6 months, which I think is excessive. The job I do isn't even that hard to... be honest. My life and the tasks I did in school were a thousand time harder, please read on if you wanna know what kind of tasks I've been doing at this company for the past 5 months.)

I'm a software engineer who had imagined myself after graduation be doing something very creative and innovative. It's the reason I'd chosen to study CS in the first place. Unfortunately, all the projects here in Bangkok are soul-draining. All I've done so far consist of fixing stuff here and there and writing some documentation.. Seriously I don't see the value in my work at all. I studied for almost the past 2 decades of my life and I wanna grow up being an adult who does something that has a positive impact to this world. My current job now doesn't give me a sense of doing something that's impactful yet meaningful at all.
There're so many people around me who have been serving the company for 10 years or even more! I really doubt how they could do that with all these mundane tasks and a constant re-org. 

Only after 3 months my manager, some guys in my team and about a hundred of people from other business units at Bangkok site have been laid off. This is quite shocking to me as a new grad but I heard from my colleagues that this kind of thing really is no surprise here. Some of them even wish their names would be on the list next time. 

Wow the mentality of those who're with the company for so long is something me -- a Millennial -- cannot really stand. It's as if they've lost their passion. They lack the motivation and they're not easily adapt to new technologies that have been coming out. I'm sad that I'm so full of energy and passion to contribute to the company but I'm surrounded by people and filled with tasks that make it harder for me to wake up for work the next morning. I will admit that I want a corporate job because I thought it'd look good on my profile and that the company would have awesome projects for me to do and the tools that the company is using would be some of the most cutting-edge in the industry (beware here I'm not talking about the tools or products that company is producing). Oh and did I mention that the company or maybe just the Bangkok site? is still using the outdated MS outlook!!?

My manager also.. hmm he's a nice person who'd listen to everything I say but doesn't really take actions towards what I've requested. For example, I've asked many times for some basic financial training as I'd like to be more knowledgable about the industry that the company I'm working for is in. Then you guess it.. I haven't had any training thus far. 

Oh one last thing, the atmosphere and the setting of the office are really really dull. On my floor, it's super packed like there's really no room for creativity. If a representative of the company just passed by my comment, please tell this to someone who'd have the power to do something for the better for Bangkok site. 

Anyway, I think this is enough for ranting. I still wanna stay with company for the industry that it's in. I'm interested in this financial world .. maybe I'd need to move to other sites where there're more cool things in action? Or maybe I should just leave for a startup.."
"3723","Take action fast and do what you've promised! 
Oh and just make the work from home thing be independent from emergency situation. I think employees should be able to decide when they want to work form home. Sometimes going to the office just isn't worth the price of the commute when the tasks they're currently dealing with don't require any collaboration."

"3756","Higher management needs to realize that there is value in more tenured employees instead of just throwing them away when a reorg is need.The goals being set were lofty and unrealistic for the current staffing which made the work environment miserable.

After that, they didn't give me any direction and just told me the consequences if I didn't pay. I set up my own repayment plan which they... agreed to. After that, I mailed my payments in, to the address provided, which was the only method of payment they would take, and they kept losing my checks in the mail. After another 3 months of 3 lost checks in the mail, I finally had to send certified mail to the same address for them to receive it. Now, the payments have gone into a new calendar year because of their lack of organization, and it will effect 2 tax years. They will not give me any direction on how to help me with my taxes or how this could effect my taxes. They said if I wanted to get a wage adjustment I could, but I didn't have to. They have no guidance, they are rude and hard to understand, and I regret fully working there. No amount of money could take back the countless hours of stress and actual dollars this company has forced me to spend.

"3798","Some recent management decisions are very questionable.  

The outsourcing of IT support a couple of years ago is a disaster: they can handle something simple like creating an email account ... but anything more complex gets bounced from team to team and tends to disappear in the ether.

The forthcoming of outsourcing of further IT teams to Tech Mahindra via TUPE is a risky strategy that is likely to be... detrimental to the company over time.  

However well the handover of knowledge - about the complex data content & software solutions handled by these IT systems - is handled between dedicated long-term staff and their Bangalore replacements, this is no substitute for the in-depth knowledge & experience of the existing staff, some of whom have been with the company for decades.  

The real risk comes when those Bangalore replacements leave after a few years for a higher salary elsewhere and some of the previous knowledge share is not passed on to their successors.  This is when Thomson Reuters clients will suddenly find their user experience no longer matches their expectations."
"3799","Consider and recognise the value and experience of your existing long-term staff, regardless of how expensive they are.  After all, your clients are paying decent money for the service! Outsourcing is cheaper in the short term but carries long-term costs."

"3801","Be more aware of how cost-cutting affects customer experience and employee morale. Don't degrade service just because it saves some money. On the other hand, continue being aggressive when it comes time to retire old/duplicative technology and products."
"3802","+At year end management let too many experienced employees go to increase the bottom line so the workload has increased for all tax implementation employees!
+Pay is 20 percent lower than comparable market jobs.
+Pay raises are historically always less than 3.5 percent no matter what unless you are promoted which is rare as not much career development or room to move up beyond Senior Manager position. 
+New... quarterly bonus plan not fare as based on billable utilization as if we all contractors and not individuals with different skill sets.  Expertise or management abilities not taken into account. 
+Company depends too much on the few billable groups to increase revenue which increases pressure on employees to remain steadily billable even when our clients are not available due to their own companies quarterly and year end obligations. We do have clients with blackout periods and are a seasonal type industry which management does not take into account or possibly understand hence a problem with this type of bonus plan. Not always possible to stay billable/utilized. 
+Company doesn't seem to care about employee morale and it is at an all time low for the past 15 years. 
+Sales people dictate too much (time frames) and make promises to clients that are not always realistic without coordinating and/or communicating to people doing the actual work.  This leads to uncomfortable conversations with clients once the actual work starts.
+There is no true method of assigning new work as work is assigned as soon as it comes in the door no matter when the work will start which can lead to employees being given to many assignments at once. We do lack capable resources in certain circumstances especially with the year and layoffs as we lost quite a few experienced people which will eventually lead to overwork and burn out so I wouldn't be surprised if we see more turnover as time goes by."
"3803","Understand we are a cyclical business.  We work hand in hand with tax and accounting departements which we need to work closely with to get most of our work completed in certain products. When the clients are blackout dates and are not available to assist us or have calls with sometimes the work standstill until they are available so it is difficult to maintain steady utilization at certain times of the year. Try to... improve employee morale by finding out what employees do not agree with or are upset about and address it before we lose more valuable people which increases the workload for everyone and harms morale."

Often not aligned... in investment and it's responsibility as it relates targets and expectation. I guess shareholders must be appeased.

- One day private cloud, next open stack, next AWS. These kind of moves within a short span of time are hurting a lot of team's productivity.

- Biggest issue: No... Trust between teams, every team has a dedicated engineer to make development workflow smooth for that team because there is no ops team to take this responsibility on. There are no self service tools that you can really use to easily deploy things to production. Your test deploy on dev and beta is very different from prod and often requires a person sitting on some other floor to approve a Change Request to push a button to deploy, when the dev actually does all the leg work.

- Get ready to be outsourced and downsized: My whole team was let go, my manager who worked for many years and colleagues with 8-10 years experience were let go. Biggest smack was a few of us were hired a few months back.  Although it was a business decision, which makes layoffs fair and nothing personal, it reflects lack of resource planning from top down when you fire people you hired months back. You can read about the layoffs in the news when their stock jumped in early November, 2016

The only way to succeed here is if you are mediocre and are able to butter up your Immediate Superior. The more bad you are the more is your chance of success. There are certain people who think they own the company and do whatever that pleases them. They make rules and do not follow. You can never... succeed here if you are remotely good as your managers consider you a threat and will only show your bad side to the upper Management who have blind faith in the managers. If you are seen as a threat to Managers in future or present you are shown in bad light to all.
Rumors spread faster than fire and are generally started by managers themselves. There is less work and more Gossip in LMS. People sit and chit-chat the entire day and to show upper management sit back late and work on weekends. People from certain states, speaking a certain language and of a certain ethnicity are given preference over others. They make you slog for the annual bonus dependent on the number hours you work and then they give you a poor rating on purpose to reduce the amount of money you should be earning.

There seems to be a specifically designed form(or few of them) for... anything you need to buy to release of new software product(in 2016, where everybody talks about shipping code fast and being agile)

Also, probably, the saddest - recent higher management decisions led to(or were intended to lead to) people to start leaving. Those, who start leaving are the ones, who will find the job easily(usually more experienced or more skilled), so the average skill level is getting lower and lower, which means that the product quality is going more and more down and this does not seem to bother anyone - everybody keeps speaking about that we'll do our best to deliver to the customer. Noone seems to understand that if colleagues that you respected and learned from start leaving - you think about leaving as well...

Disagreeing and asking inconvenient questions is not in the culture - every post of higher management in corporate network is followed by 50+ comments that say that it was very enlightening/inspiring, but nobody discusses the topic..."
"4494","Don't pretend to understand and nod, when you hear is criticism - start actually doing something. The culture of not making mistakes led to people spending huge amount of time discussing everything over and over again - there are rarely things that can not be fixed later on in the next iteration. Spend money on hiring the right people - especially the ones that develop your product, make their process of doing work... a pleasure(cut off bureaucracy and allow teams to make independent decisions)."

The company would require you to pay back the difference of what they paid you at 150% and what your final average was for the year.  The company will come after you too even if you leave.  It is basically like getting a loan from the... bank without interest that you didn't ask for.  Word of advice if you go to Thomson Reuters.  Be mindful of the claw back.  This encourages sales reps to barely make their quota then start looking forward to the next month."
"4689","Get rid of the claw back.  Thomson Reuters has great products and the ability to make a lot of money in sales, but it discourages sales reps from blowing out the quota in fear of needing to pay back the company."

"4709","It's cool to be big, but adopt the mindset of small, nimble groups to deploy products in order to increase end-user satisfaction and attract great candidates to the team.

Or they'll find strange ways to save money, for example by abolishing all local IT support, and outsourcing it to IBM. Sure, they let the existing employees sign on at IBM, but the whole thing was awkwardly implemented and people on all sides were complaining.

Another problem is that they tend to be stuck in the typical corporate solutions. Since they have a universal site license for Oracle, why should they approve MongoDB for your project?

The pay scale is very low when compared to similar jobs at other companies. When talent gets outsourced to India (and it does every few years), job security goes out the window and so does quality. It leaves the people who are left... with jobs to correct sloppy outsourced work. TR's favorite victims to lay off are the older folks without degrees, who have little to no hope searching for new jobs. If they do, by chance, make the cut and survive a layoff, they get a false sense of security and hang around until the next round of layoffs. So, if you're looking for short-term employment, go for it. If you want career stability, look elsewhere."
"5286","Stop depending on cheap labor from India. Your profits always go down when the quality of your products goes down. You repeatedly make the same outsourcing mistakes over and over again.

This may vary based on business unit and project... as to how much or lack of process there is.

Salary is decent for the area but don't expect large raises. Your pay will remain relatively stagnant and like many others, you may end up tempted to move on to greener salaried pastures after your experience starts to eclipse your current pay rate.

TR likes to talk about Agile development and implementing new processes, but much of it is weakly implemented. Without a strong hand to force teams to use the new process, many just cherry pick (or ignore) what they want and things remain broken. TR 'Agile' is not true agile, it is more of a strange offshoot.

Seems to be hiring more contractors and less full-time employees, and not back filling empty positions as much. Might be an industry trend more than a hit against TR though.

My story is very personal because I was also struggling with being a new parent at the same time and having two unfamiliar jobs was very hard for me, and my resilience faltered.

I became a business analyst when the department had just moved from waterfall to agile and I think that not having come through the ranks as a staff business analyst with waterfall was a drawback - the more I became aware of the skills and underlying competencies needed to be a Business Analyst, I found that I was not strong enough in most of those skills.  Also I learn best by repetition and I never gain traction on how to write a user story because there was no repetition in what you were writing a user story for - every feature was something that never existed, so I felt I was starting from scratch every time."

I tried to stick it out, then found out by my former manager (who also left the company), that your success rises and falls based on the territory you are given. If you're in a bad territory, then so be it. I witnessed and heard stories of managers hand selecting candidates for transfers to other departments and these were not solely based on hitting your sales goals. It's a 100% old boys club. Not to mention that your job, was to scour your account list and offer your clients a book volume discount, based on them buying more product when this is a CLEAR violation of the company ethical policy to ""never offer a customer a discount based on purchasing a new product or service"".

In many cases free training credits TR was comp'ed would go unused and expire rather than hand them to people that needed training because the were poorly m\managed.

"5959","-Results driven performance. I saw this as a pro but it could be a con to some people because
if you do not meet a certain metric, you may not make the grade."
"5960","Working in a call center can be taxing and the work-life balance really does not exist.  Being scheduled prevents the opportunity to really have control over planning your life.  Time off can be difficult to get due to lack of coverage.  It seems like the ability to move up depends on who is interviewing you and how long you have been there.  Your previous skills and what you bring to the table are completely... useless.  The year minimum of being in an entry level job of a call center is not useful.  It should be six months for entry level positions to provide mobility for fast-starters who get bored of this position and start to look for other opportunities elsewhere.  

Pay is also a difficult balance.  You do not get any bump in pay for an entire year, no matter how well you do, how much better you are compared to your peers or how many products you learn.  The incentive to do well does isn't present when your mobility is limited.  I really want to stay with the company but I don't know how much more I can take in the current position I am in."
"5961","The times are changing.  Millenials and those a little older than that demographic do not have the patience to play the company game.

Don't lose those who can help achieve that vision."
"5962","Lack of leadership and vision. Poor communication all across the company and ranks. Unclear objectives. Complicated rewarding system.

2) stop preaching about customer excellence and actually deliver it

The company tries to change it's entry level employee profile to require some experience or additional skills, however the starting salary remained on the same level, making it very difficult to recruit for openings."
"5986","Employee retention is the biggest problem. The innovative, young culture brings many college graduates in, however the salaries are not enough to keep tenured, experienced staff. There is a big discrepancy (even 50%) in salaries between employees who started 7 years ago and those who started 5 years ago, even though the positions are either exactly the same or comparable."

"5995","Processes need to better streamlined, inconsistencies with some systems.  Job is a lot harder than it needs to be."
"5996","Marketing and sales need to work together better.  Sales staff need to have a less stressful comp plan.  You can earn a lot but also owe a lot, it's not healthy to reps mentality and creates negativity and higher turnover.  There needs to be a more human aspect to decision making.  Everyone wants to make money and improve the share price, however the comp plan seems to be put together with no thought about how reps... will react."
"5997","Top management tends to disregard employees welfare in exchange for numbers and cutting costs. Prime example, in 2013, CEO sent out an email detailing and praising employees for bringing the company additional business and revenue due to hard work. Right under it, he also went on to mention how within 3 months, the company was going to let go 5K people globally.
Benefits kept getting changed and reduced almost on a... yearly basis.
Offshoring was always an issue as well as their constant head bumping and somewhat unfair treatment with union positions."
"5998","Upper management can show favoritism with people and when looking to move up in the company you have to play politics of who you know rather than most qualified. The insurance offered isn't the best and they are laying off a ton of people for ridiculous reason (great company, but the turn over is high so cover your butt and be ready to play corporate politics)"

"6007","I can only hope things have improved with senior management with acquisition by Thompson--the company used to have a re-organization every 15-18 months which never improved business lines. Senior managers would be re-assigned periodically with business groups changed slightly which made it difficult to attribute historic performance to anyone in particular."
"6008","Shrinking benefits, outsourcing, no vision for future, low pay and poor work environment (mostly due to outsourcing)."
"6009","Outsourcing is an exercise in futility.  Prepare to spend more money in-sourcing after the project fails."
"6010","Some departments are far behind on technology and have large amounts of technical debt slowing them down.  They use the teams in India as a threat to US workers from time to time.  I have been told when estimating something that if my estimate was too high that the work would go to Bangalore.  Not a great way to foster relationships between the two groups."
"6011","Stop the large number of reorgs and bring focus back to doing a few things incredibly well.  Stop threatening employees with taking their work overseas.  We all know the euphemism ""you have to understand, we are a Global company."" is a threat to find cheaper labor overseas.   Stop treating employees as commodities."

"6025","Keep up the warmness you show your employees, it goes a long way. Constructive criticism is always helpful!"
"6026","The industry is very cyclical and you make a majority of your sales outside of tax deadlines. This makes it difficult to maintain a monthly quota with industry deadlines and working with small businesses. The competition and competitor sales reps have made it difficult to keep deals, as they come back with better offers and lock-in contracts. TR hasn't made the move to Salesforce and has made it not ideal yet to... work from home based on slowness of systems. Top reps at 100% of annual quota and meeting half of department and team and indivisdal bonuses (hitting 6/12 months), only make about 105-110K at best. Top reps in core sales rarely make above 120-130K. Little no none for carrer opportunities. Management positions are little to none and open up every few years."
"6027","Raise the salaries for your senior employees and work harder to retain top talent. We lose too many top sales reps to other companies based on the fact that our commission tier starts over every year and you go back down to your base at the start of every year. Other companies swoop in and offer twice the base salary and have a higher ceiling of earning potential after 12-18 months."
"6028","At times the work environment can be uncomfortable since management turns a blind eye to employee debauchery and extramarital affairs."
"6029","Show morals and family values matter! Elite's annual Vantage conferences are a breeding ground for extramarital affairs.  Free alcohol and generous spending accounts are supposed to motivate employees tho these are widely and openly abused. During Vantage 2015 many of us were made uncomfortable when a married sr. systems engineer from L.A was hooking up with a tech writer from NM and it is not a ""private"" matter... when it pollutes the work environment."

Morale is low as a result and some of the excellent programs see less attendance for fear of being seen in a bad light for attending."

Truly they are different, both of value but I ultimately left because I wanted ot interact... with people face to face and not in front of a computer screen with a headset.

Makes no sense but she is merely a figure... head until the next figure head comes in who also will know nothing about our customers or the business of law.

I routinely worked 6 or 7 days a week, but, when I needed to leave an hour early for a doctor's appt., my manager threatened... disciplinary action. Mgt refuses to pay non-exempt employees OT.

Opportunities to advance are almost non-existent unless you ""know"" somebody high up.  It's very much a ""good old boy"" network especially in the Legal division (not sure if... that's true in other divisions).  The company is dispersed between several sites, due to acquisitions, outsourcing, and remote employees.  Unfortunately they are not all treated equally in regards to opportunities to move around and grow, the employees not located at the Eagan site are at a serious disadvantage.

2. The top management and sales team just focus on getting doc review projects as it gives them the maximum revenue and the projects have insane deadlines which in turn makes the employees work for 11-13hrs everyday and... sometimes even on weekends. The work life balance is zero, the working environment is pathetic in the litigation department, the managers are not approachable and stupid rules are applied on the floor for crap work that they make people do. 

3. So if you are in another department and do not have billing hours because of their lack of projects, your sent to litigation to do doc review under the pretext that you will get a higher bonus and that you aren't profitable to the company if u can't bill. Never have i seen such ridiculous management of projects. When you are sent you have no idea how long you are expected to be there, no clarity regarding anything. 

4. The HR department sux. I don't know what they do because important things like ur increment and bonus letters have calculation mistakes!

"6304","About 2004 major cost cutting started with a program called ""fast forward"", since then much of the pressure to increase returns for investors has been met by cost cutting rather than revenue growth. It is typical to get emails from the CEO that say words to the effect ""well done we have grown revenues by 2%, ..... bla bla bla.  We are going to cut XYZ"".  For the past 3 years I've seen cuts about every 6 months. Over... the past 10 years it is hard to remember a year in which there were no cutbacks. In 10 years the IT department started off in-house then it was outsourced to IBM, then Fujitsi, then brought in house, now being outsourced again. There are the typical/stupid frustrations of we have budget for X but not for Y. For example no budget to buy descent computers for developers, rather than spend $1000 to upgrade a computer, they will pay someone much more to sit around and do nothing because they are waiting for their under powered out-dated computer. A lot of big company policies. You can choose any two from these, cheap, quick, quality. Cheap and quick is the priority now, quality used to be the priority, but that's no longer the case.  Get the software out there and worry about it later appears to be the management motto now.  There seems to be a belief that you can swap any team out, so a team that knows a product inside out can all be let got and the product handed over to a team that knows nothing about it; people and teams are not plug-and-play like that. Often a conservative approach to doing things, this does not mean quality it means unnecessarily sticking with old technology, this can be to the point where they are using hardware and software that is a decade beyond it's official end of life, indeed some hardware would more suited to a museum."

Sadly, starting with the appointment of  Mr. Glocer, management seems to have little or no experience working directly with our end users, resulting in a culture of book smarts over street smarts - management by the book is killing the company. 
In addition a once fair system of promotions based on the right... skills & attitudes have been replaced with 'back stabbing' to further careers. Many times people with low skill sets but good political ability progress quickly, leaving the right people behind."

Highly respected globally, great growth potential, low debts, cash rich, low dividends but high return on stock price etc. 
This has changed. I don't feel the company has the global respect it once did. Constantly trying to replicate the... Bloomberg business model has resulted in the company falling further behind it's competitor. Complicated products with more care given to asthetics than content & ease of access has made the products more like apps than tools.
Finally. The wrong people are in middle & upper management. The right school, degree or ability to use buzz words & produce great looking reports does not make a good manager. Concentrate on people again & this company will be great again."

"6403","Too many regime changes, too much ""transformation""...every 6 months to 1 year, we get the rug pulled out from under us, and are expected to buy in to whatever senior management is selling at the time. Senior management have a very poor sense of how their actions impacts the people on the front lines, and how terrible morale negatively impacts the bottom line they care so much about.

Pay for technical jobs is... subpar and too dependent on how well you market yourself, not what you actually produce. No career growth for senior developers / technologists, except on a managerial path.

On an HR note, the stacked ranking that was put in place in the last couple years was a terrible idea. The questions that it forces front line managers to ask are valuable, but the policy itself encourages cutthroat behavior, not collaboration. Did they not learn from other companies that tried this method and suffered for it?

Onboarding of technical staff is not handled well. No training. It is very much up to the front line managers, some of whom have too many direct reports to be effective.

Terminations / departures are also not handled well. Poor communication from upper-mid / senior management, who seem to have no clue that withholding information only blindsides the people on the front lines, those whose livelihoods are most impacted by such changes, and it breeds resentment and distrust."

"6415","My division at Thomson Reuters used to be a great place to work.  Working on exciting technologies and being surrounded by really talented people made working at Thomson fun and motivating.  The middle management worked great with their employees, creating a team and product that anyone could be proud of.

Unfortunately the new CTO in our division has ""came in like a wrecking ball"", demolishing in months what took... years for middle management to build.  Some of his ideas are good but his entire implementation is damaging the company and morale more than anyone in ""upstairs"" has begun to realize.  I have watched week after week as some of our best people have jumped ship.  Now the entire management chain between me and the CTO has left the company and most of our best people who understood the product are gone.  CTO thinks that he can just outsource the problem away because he ""can get two outsourced employees for the cost of one in the USA""."

2. Not too many geeks on the floor.
3. Most of the freshers would be hired on a contract basis and they endlessly keep extending the contact period. They would convert you to a full-time employee only if they find you as a critical resource.
4. HRBP should treat the employees with respect and should be considerate during salary negotiation.... It must be a healthy discussion and has to be a 2-way traffic rather than being ignorant throughout the meeting session.  HRBP's treat the employees like beggars and no matter how critical you are as a resource to the team, they always discourage you by say - ""I can get a new resource with a lesser package and still can get the job done."""
"6443","1. Visibility up the hierarchy is too low - make it transparent.

There is too much emphasis placed on metrics and statistics instead of letting staff do their jobs to the best of their ability. A lot of out-sourcing and moving jobs to locations... where workforce is cheaper, but I've seen firsthand how bad this cheaper workforce is."

When your annual employee survey has more than 50% of your staff saying you do not promote competent people into leadership roles year after year there is a major problem. Incredibly unwieldy organizational structure. Frequent layoffs. High management turnover. Management decisions rarely ever... reflect the on-the-ground realities of our markets. The company rarely ever takes the time to actually work through existing issues before jumping onto its next project leaving us to navigate through broken processes all around. Decision makers never take feedback from the front lines into account so business issues are rarely ever solved."

"6480","TR has built a phenomenal reputation on providing best in class products but growth at too fast a rate (while appealing to investors) can be detrimental to the longevity of the business and newer offerings. When you ask for way more output, while drastically reducing resources, it's a recipe for poor employee engagement, which will have a will also hamper growth. Happy employees produce more."
"6481","I worked in QA, and despite constantly being told that QA is vital, blah blah de blah, I constantly felt like I was being treated as a hoop to jump through before deploy, instead of a member of a team and a peer. There was also rarely money to hire testers-- we frequently continued with bad tester to dev ratios because there ""wasn't budget"" for another tester, and had to make due with stopgap solutions of interns... (some really solid, some not, and all of them needing training in) and contractors (generally technically solid, not necessarily a QA background, and always leaving soon because we weren't allowed to keep contractors more than X amount of months).

In general, I was incredibly poorly managed. The flat structure was working against you here-- my lead was handling multiple teams using multiple different technologies and never really had time to understand what exactly **I** was facing until I came to them with a crisis, despite having given them a lot of warnings when that crisis was just in ""kind of a problem"" or ""could be a problem"" mode. 

Heaven forbid you had a hotfix, that was *always* QA's fault, despite QA not being given enough time to thoroughly test and saying so, or something not being ever conveyed to QA as a testable. Also, interpersonal politics meant that my team was constantly being scrutinized by people much higher up because of personal beefs. 

Shortly into my time at Thomson, I was thrust into a role that had previously been filled by a senior tester. They retired, I got their role-- with all the same expectations, despite **not** being experienced enough or knowledgeable enough to fill it. Look, I was a dumb recent grad who thought I knew more than I did, some of that's on me, but a lot more is on the manager who made that call. When issues arose from this, my lead was supposed to help me handle them-- and I got nothing. I felt extremely unsupported by my lead and felt like I was an antagonist to the developers on my team. I also felt dicked around-- I went from being told in a performance review that I was looking at a promotion soon to being told two weeks later that I needed to shape up or they'd put me on an improvement plan (and, the implication was, fire me if I didn't improve).

When personnel issues arose, my managers shifted the responsibility of dealing with them to me, treating me like a peer instead of mediating potential problems. I eventually had to file an HR complaint over a situation that could have been ameliorated by some handling by my manager from the beginning.

Time management in general was also terrible. Thomson gives a decent amount of vacation time, but I constantly felt like I couldn't take it because of the timelines and pressure to deliver put on me. They were pretty good about leaving the work at work and not taking it home, but if you wanted to take more than a day of vacation, expect to get some dirty looks. This was compounded because I was the sole tester for a team, and had no reliable backup who could take over release testing if I wanted to take vacation.

There was a lot of privileging the appearance of an agile team over actually building sustainable agile practices. Also, Thomson talks a big game over being able to transfer around in the company, but in practice, nah."
"6482","Pay more attention to people without direct reports, a flat org structure doesn't matter if the people who are actually doing the day to day development and testing have no support from or confidence in their management to back their decisions.

Also, seriously, if you're going to say that people should be able to get an ergonomic evaluation of their workspace, make it easier to get that done. I spent a year... asking for one and left the company before one got done."

The only real downside (and this may be just the area I work in) is there is no social interaction at all. It's all business all the time. Lunch is a good example of this - everyone eats while working at their desk or schedules meetings throughout the lunch hour. There are no... pleasantries exchanged. No after work happy hours. No friendly banter. There is as much social interacts as if I were working from home full time.

Recently aspart of Re Structuring Thomson Reuters rebadged some Employees Starting :
Am Talking on Practical Bases as i know this and i was cheated Ex TR : 
So Basically Thmson Reuters Wanted to get Rid of certain Teams due to Reuters being in Media Industry they did not want this to do directly.
SO here is What Happened : 
Accounting Team to Genpact : {P.S EVERY BODY KNOWS GENPACT... }
For Ex : There was a Team of 30 in GA after 12 months in Genpact 3 Remaining

Tech Team was give to IBM :{IBM. P.S GOd Sake No not there}
Ex : A Team of 25 People were given 9 Remaining.

So HR's played very Dirty Roles very sad.. 
People who denied to rebadge were asked to wait wait wait & then severance was given.
People who opted to move out their Bonus were swallowed + No Severance

As I look at how the company has been operating it appears that TR has been having challenges to improvements for over 5... years.

...While on paper they call it an account manager position the the reality is that it's mostly new business focused.  So if you're looking for a true account manager position look elsewhere because at least 50% of your time will be spent trying to win new business.  You may see virtually nothing for those efforts but management at the time and maybe now management places a big priority on... quantity of cold calls and number of demos.  which is silly because the offering is expensive (for tax departments) and companies that benefit most are large, public and global.

The territory will make or break you.  Again when selling to larger companies, the deal size is largely based on how big the company is that your selling to, is it a 2 person tax department or one with 39 in the US and 150 globally.  The latter will obviously be a bigger project with higher software license fees and a bigger implementation budget.  

Where are big companies located?  In major metro areas, so that's where you'll want to work IF you want to hit quota and make money talked about during interviews.  

Another con is that they give all the reps the same number to hit.  This is just foolishness as the bar is set too low for some, far too high for others and MIGHT be appropriate for those in the middle.  For example 3 different people worked the New Jersey territory, all exceeded quota by 150% or more.  Is it the reps who were so talented? Or maybe NJ lends itself towards that much in sales...and it's not that the sales rep was so spectacular, they just didn't mess up a good thing.

Management is definitely knowledgeable about the product but they never did any sales grunt work  so what comes out of their mouth about actually selling and winning NEW business is opinion and theory.

Current sales managers were those who showed the product (product solutions experts or called ""business development"" at this job), cold calling was never something they did, so they also can't appreciate how long a sales cycle can be from 1st cold call to sign contract.  It could be a year or longer when you're calling a company truly from a cold start.  If a companies auditor says ""get software"" that can really slant a deal in your favor. 

Out of 10 legitimate sales opportunities 4 at most will come from things you exclusively start cold.  Again going back to how each rep gets the same quota, reps also get a list of current clients to retain and sell to.  

Some reps make more than 50% of their sales selling to current clients.  You may also do joint deals with big accounting firms/channel parters so working with them can be very advantageous.  You may also get business from other reps on Thomson Reuters tax and accounting.

 These things can be very lucrative if they work in your favor, and frustrating if they dont.

The good territories IE, southern Cali, NYC, NJ, Houston, Chicago etc...you know areas full of ideal prospects and customers, reps who work these areas probably arent leaving and if they do, those territories won't be given to someone brand new.

Work here at your own risk.  you could get lucky in your first 6 months if you inherit outstanding deals the previous rep was working on. 


If you dress nice and play patty cake the way management likes they'll say youre doing great.  
If you close deals like this and arent liked, they'll say you're lazy and you can expect a ""performance improvement plan"" 

If you work hard and it's not working out, it's not entirely your fault, management may have an opinion about things you can ""improve"" upon but what really makes someone successful or not is the list you get to work.  Again that list should contain some outstanding business to chase and close, cold calls, current clients (at least 15 to work with) channel partners to network with etc.  

Again working in a concentrated territory such as Manhattan or Chicago, you can do smart things like hold a user group and get customers to mix and mingle.  You don't have this option working a scattered territory that consists of a bunch of states in the midwest. 

With sales jobs like this the big difference between average and successful reps is the list one gets to work.  The rest is all largely opinion.  

Much of what is written here is applicable to many other companies.  

Most companies have weak
or non-existing sales and marketing strategies
and have no way to track
the strategies they do have 

Doing the job and managing it are 2 different things.  The average b2b sale is 7 months.  And most managers think that if it takes this long it's because sales people aren't working so they like to hire, train, let go, and train over and over. 

Sales training and hiring is too often a knee jerk solution to what's really a marketing problem.  Real marketing consists of uncovering WHO the client really is and how many there are to market to.  Often times sales managers are far removed from the process and take an over simplistic and over eager approach to winning new business.  Employee over turn is a symptom of this.  It's like wake up already....obviously the accounts new reps get is cherry picked completely or to a degree.  It's not realistic to keep hiring people to work the bottom 20% of your prospect list and expect a different result. 

And while this is fancy shmancy ""corporate b2b sales"" it's not much more complicated than say...the restaurant business. 

Too many servers and they complain they don't make money.

Too few servers and they might make money in the short term but service suffers and damages the restaurants reputation in the long run.  

Again proceed here with caution, both sides may have the best intentions but the way the game is designed by higher ups at TR and played out by management, means it may not work out well for both.  And if it doesn't it's made out to be far too personal - at least that was the case for me.  (but this happens all the time in sales) 

Also this is also what you could consider a mature business.   This was a business acquired by Thomson in 2008.  It's likely done it's thing already - and it's very very absorbed into the Thomson Mother ship.

if you're looking to do your job and also innovate and champion new projects this is not the place. 

In the past new hires who have become successful have not only inherited some good accounts to work on, but have also been good at brown nosing and being liked. 

If you've been there for a while and haven't hit your number even though you worked hard for what you did do, move on, find something that's moving and shaking.  Especially because most employers these days want someone with not just software experience but also experience in a vertical.

If you'll stay in tax and accounting, then fine, if you don't see yourself in tax and accounting all the more reason to move on. 

Again, not dining this segment of the TR tax and accounting business, might be great for non sales people, but for sales not so much in my experience."
"6741","Look at sales on a state by state basis you may be surprised to learn that reps are not as good or as bad as you think - forget your biases and opinions.  Stop giving all the same quota because each state has disproportionate sales.   Give veterans the top 5 geographies...and don't do things like hire new reps and give them crap to work with and then place blame on them.  It's also spitting in the face of those... who've worked there for a while.  Rather than have 2 reps in 2 territories who sell a combined $1.5 million, don't hire and let someone hungry work what was once 2 territories. 

Sure you'll pay them bonus but now you're making the same sales, paying 1 salary instead of 2, and you havent spent money to attract and train a new hire.

Existe uma demora absurda em relação a solução dos problemas de sua plataforma online para e-books (proview).

"6817","Firstly, what all i am putting below is mainly for Technology operations and Product IT related jobs. If you are in Marketing, Sales, Media or Research, things may be different but part of below may still be applicable.

- There is absolutely no career growth if you are working from India no matter which position you join in as. Most managers in US/UK will simply showcase themselves for all the work done in rest... of the world and eat all the big positions.

- After the Reuters merger, the company looked unstable for a while as most of the fractured but diplomatic Reuters Leadership overtook the larger and more organised Thomson Leadership. Now to hide that instability, the UK centric (and some hand in glove orthodox US) so called ""strategic"" management from Ex Reuters has propelled tricks of outsourcing, severe cost cutting etc. to inflate the stock prices, but make no mistake - most of these termite ridden pillars may come down soon.

- Projects just drag and drag in the name of process, strategy, framework and governance. Though the company boasts of Information Technology products, most of the members in leadership don't even know the meaning of technology. All they know is to say the word ""strategy"" a 100 times each day and get a million dollar pay check every quarter for that.

- Frankly speaking there is actually an urgent need for layoffs in the company as almost half of the company does redundant work. But what is actually happening is that most of the very redundant staff is sitting in the leadership or have Godfathers in the leadership and company is facing outsourcing and severe attrition of some really talented folks.

- The company wastes money on lots of unnecessary events and process related tasks and though the company has ""talent"" and ""performance"" as its so called values, not many in the Management have an idea as to what these words mean, forget implementing. If you are looking for constructive travel opportunity/trainings, then simply forget it as in current ""cost-cutting mode"", the company would rather throw the money in some stupid activity than spend on the growth of their employee."
"6818","- Firstly try to build trust with the employees. There is an extreme trust deficit both ways - from management and also from employees. Its very difficult for employees to trust anything the Management says because of repetitive lies and hiding of crucial facts. Also management should not just jump to external vendors for each and every thing showing mistrust and also disregard to their own team.

- Remove the... redundant management layer whose only job is to build hundreds of process steps without having any clue how to implement them. Try to be vigilant that who all are fooling you by taking credit for work done elsewhere.

- Remove redundant tasks. Most often different teams are doing the same thing. Just calling it with different names. 

- Educate teams to spend more time on work than calls/meetings. More than half of the company is always on calls/meetings and think that its a big achievement.

- Empower the team and hold them accountable.

- Try to be in the shoes of employees and think how one can grow his/her career in the current state of the company.

- Encourage and promote performers and not diplomats/politicians in IT."

There are also too many hands in the pot, project managers, tech managers, etc. all have their own ideas of how projects should be... run, but many have little hands-on experience of running a project.  Many were in the right place at the right time and got promoted with little merit of their own contributions.

Merit increases are pitiful.  For a few years there was a slogan among management of paying for performance - but that never really materialized and across the board 2-3% raises with little opportunity to recognize top performers does not help with employee engagement or motivation

Lack of ownership - at least in WestlawNext, there is a model of one platform with hundreds of developers.

They aren't willing to spend any meaningful investments into building out the infrastructure of the business anymore.  The... only projects that ever get implemented are very small short term projects.  Anything of substance that will position the company to be more agile in the future is deemed to expensive.  Thus in 5 years the business will not be able to adapt to the ever changing environment and TR will be left in the dust by a company that is able to provide the customers what they want, when they want it at a price that TR will not be able to come close to."

Execs would come to DC to see our operations, which we had to make great pomp and circumstance for, only to see the exec canned in less than a year. Our business was reassigned into a different unit of TR three times... and the product was losing market share hand over fist. Projects would start with a great idea, only to be nitpicked or funding to be cut so much that the end result was a joke and didn't sell. Needless to say, with all the hot potato, the pay was pretty poor and they were always coming up with stories to lower our bonuses. Not a whole lot of opportunity to advance in the company. The due diligence side of the business experiences very high levels of turnover, always a lot of temps over there."
"7173","Oy. The core legal research part of TR in DC is down to a skeleton crew and was downsizing for years before I left. The whole legal leadership needs to stick with an idea and not try to be everything to everyone. Our products were failing because of a belief customers wanted everything (all TR combined content) when in reality they just wanted it to do one thing (and the thing it had done before TR got their hands... on it) really well. Revenue shortcomings at the corporate level are masked by going out and acquiring a small upstart and then canning management when revenue continues to miss target or integration fails. Not all the execs, in DC or Eagan, were bad...but they were all mostly powerless to the overarching culture of the legal side of the business."

"7393","The biggest issue is insecurity due to inconsistency from executives. The company is constantly acquiring and divesting, and we re-organized so frequently it was almost a joke. This means lots of people live in constant, justified paranoia of being laid off.  It seemed like we had a new executive team every 6 months, with new ideas about where we were going and how we would get there. It doesn't sound that bad, but... by the time I left (I was laid off, obviously), I was exhausted and stressed from constantly trying to re-define my role and adjust to new bosses and new strategies.  It was almost a relief to lose this job because I'd been expecting the layoff to come for so long -- not a great sign."
"7394","Executive team needs to figure out long term strategies and stick to them, and do a better job of communicating those strategies to the rank and file in a timely and effective manner. Projects begin, are placed under intense deadlines and expectations, and then die abruptly, undermining morale. And employees can never be sure how secure their position is, which further undermines morale and can result in... inefficiency and negativity. Management can also hide behind that famous Minnesota passive-aggressiveness -- lying to people that everything is great when it's not, or reassuring folks who have every reason to be concerned about their jobs isn't kind, it's cruel."

Thomson Reuters tends to grow by acquisition but does not tend to get rid of the executives of the acquired company (see above).... This means that companies take a long time to integrate and employees follow inefficient processes ""because that's how we always did it at xyz acquired company"". Big companies need to have processes, some bureaucracy etc., but TR takes it to a new level of inefficiency. It's like a leaky supertanker. It ends every year a bit lower in the water, and everyone's worried, but they chuck a  good number of employees overboard at the end of each year, and so the ship stays afloat."

The leadership at the top is great... however they talk a good game however the changes are not cascading down to the front line directors and managers."
"7480","There are changes that need to be made when dealing with the different generations and Thomson is failing and keeping up with them.

Leadership often fails to recognize hard work, tends to treat all workers like minions, and does not promote the most capable players. My position was very stagnant and offered little opportunity for growth despite both my attempts and it being advertised as a rotational, growth-type position. Certain... departments have serious issues in leadership, including an unwillingness to share important information, taking full credit for employee's accomplishments, ignoring employee feedback, and rampant sexism. The leadership of the company also tends to manipulate financial results (i.e. salary raises were delayed 3 months to pad Q1 and Q2 profits) and expends its energy on immediate pleasing of shareholders instead of fostering a good working environment and strong values that would result in positive long term aspects for the company. Suggestions: stay away from Order Fulfillment, Sales Compensation Administration, and Customer Service. Actually, I suggest staying away from the company altogether."
"7550","Work on an open environment where information is shared, not hoarded. Find new ways to encourage managers to manager rather than claim credit for employee accomplishments. Work harder to promote the best players rather than taking the easy route and promoting even the laziest well-liked."

""tempo de casa"" e não há a menor avaliação se aquela pessoa tem capacidade de liderar outras pessoas, resultando em péssimos chefes que só desmotivam a equipe.

"7565","When people in top management, and many others in middle management, who have all been with the company for 10-15 years, are jumping ship on their own accord and going to key competitors, you know there's an issue. TR has been hit hardest with re-orgs this year. Everyone who hasn't been laid off, no matter his/her title or place in the organization, has got their resume up and is interviewing elsewhere. Reason is... not just the inadequate reorgs, it's also that internal opportunities are almost non-existent, and even those posted on the Careers site are just there for show, and open roles mainly go to people whom the hiring manager already knew well before opening the posting; internal moves to adequate positions are extremely limited, and HR is unresponsive and unhelpful."
"7566","Management should invest in existing long-time talent, instead of sending all of it to search for employment at the closest and biggest competitors. Management should learn from past mistakes, and the only way to do so is to stop laying off good workers with Exceeded performance reviews, just in an effort to meet numbers. Meeting your numbers should be by fixing the product, so Sales have something to sell.... Unfortunately, most of your top talent in the Product team has also left this year - on their own accord."
"7567","In less than five years, my business unit within Thomson Reuters has undergone 6 reorganizations.  With each reorganization, they let people go.  Most of the very talented people I mentioned above are now gone as a result, and Thomson Reuters makes no effort to find new positions for their talent.

It makes... selling in the small firm market a very tough go since support expectations can be lacking.

Management style has changed in the last couple of years, with stories of higher-level managers reaching out and contacting sales people, rather than communicating with the direct line manager.  You start to wonder what the purpose is of having a sales manager, what they're actually doing.

In conversations with people who have recently left the company, they've changed the compensation program in such a way that it has become very hard to make money,partly because they've raised the sales expectations so high that making your number has become really a huge hurdle, and hence, making a good buck.

Another major flaw is the time it takes to get a product launched. Two plus years to launch a major... product is not acceptable. Too many cooks in the kitchen is half the problem. By the time products are launched, it is so far behind our competitors, it's hard to sell into the marketplace. 
Marketing management is also weak. Just because one has a JD does not make them a good marketing manager. To transform marketing, bring in MARKETING people who know how to market.

Yes, there... is a paper policy but management needs to let up on the iron grip of not allowing people to work from home on a consistent basis.

Management expects employees to work in their roles for 5 years or more without questioning about growth options in terms of position or compensation.

"7718","Like some big corporations, certain managers care only for appearances and their own career instead of helping resolve real issues on their team.  I was a top performer on my sales team, and as a result, I dealt with a great deal of animosity, gossip, and almost high schoolish bullying from others on my team.  People would openly not invite me to company outings, and more importantly, openly refuse to help me when I... needed assistance with a task.  People were not even civil to me which made my work life very tense.  Comments were made about my appearance, ethnic background and unflattering posts were made about me on social media, some of which were even defamatory.

I tried to take the high road but in order to keep an appearance of having a ""great"" team, my manager failed to even speak to my peers or take any action to discourage this sort of thing.  I produced excellent numbers.  However, eventually the daily hostility I faced got to me and I started breaking down emotionally.  Instead of being supportive, my manager basically suggested that I was the one with issues and couldn't get along with people.  People in my division of Thomson Reuters were very petty and did not want to see me succeed.  I eventually broke down and out of frustration, I said some things to my manager I could not take back and was let go.  So the bullies won.  Yet they celebrated my defeat publicly on social media.  I had grounds for a defamation suit but opted to never look back.  However, I do think future job seekers should be aware of what I went through.  Great culture right?"
"7719","There's more to running a business than keeping up appearances.  Try to understand the needs of employees who are subjected to the kind of workplace bullying I dealt with instead of blaming the victim.  Also, realize that good sales professionals are inspired by successful people.  They don't resent them for raising the bar.  Encourage work ethic, integrity, and respect in your culture.  Discourage the use of social... media for unprofessional purposes in the office.  If someone comes to you with a concern, try to understand their situation.

Leaders need to get out and engage more, get more face time with employees, and show their human face... a bit more often.

They are clueless when it comes to keeping great people because they are all eventually forced out due to the unrealistic quotas and the ridiculous focus on the short term.
2) Sales force has ZERO loyalty to the company because they know that it's short term job  .. max 5-6 years if you're... lucky, but more likely just a couple. This results in the reps managing their numbers and taking whatever shortcuts they can to meet quota.
3) Ridiculous systems that make for an unreal amount of non-selling busy work, lost productivity and tremendous resentment toward management. 
4) C-level management is clueless when it comes to understanding the anger that lawyers and law firms have toward Thomson because of the perceived price gouging. This is a result of too many MBA's that don't have a clue in understanding the customer. I had a great customer tell me last week that the West Publishing brand has been 100% decimated by Thomson."
"7902","Take a look at your stock price over the last 15-20 years and you'll get an idea of how you have performed. Too much short term emphasis which has really hurt Thomson badly. The Board Of Directors should be sued for malpractice for allowing the ridiculous buyout of Reuters at nose bleed valuations. This was a brutal mistake that has absolutely hammered the stock price, caused huge layoffs, forced ridiculous price... increases in other divisions to try and make up numbers and created an absurd amount of pressure on the employees.

This was dis-spiriting; one takes pride in good products, not in great masses of mediocre work. Few dared express this. Most managers were great, but some of those left. A few were micromanaging sociopaths and they stayed. Upper management's duplicity and contempt for employees was noticeable."
"7952","The bottom line is only one measure and not a particularly human one. Consider customer satisfaction and employee engagement. Recognize that compensating for slipping quality by boosting production is short sighted.

Incentives and promotions are a farce - is opaque, biased and ad hoc - Corporate nepotism is a way of life... here. 
Leadership has no trust in their colleagues or employees - politics is rife within the upper echelons - they are mostly playing a blame game without anybody stepping up to shoulder the responsibility
One senior member I reported to told me ""You should be willing to suck toe of the senior members"" - a statement that reflects on the quality of the leadership.

Result = lots of very frustrated, underpaid decent employees increasingly looking elsewhere...This will not assist the... company in retaining and growing profit."
"8022","Stop chasing short term profits at the expense of loyal employees. It doesn't cost that much in the general scheme of things to take hard working people out for a drink once every few months and would massively boost morale. Stop putting so much emphasis on qualifications (and subsequently hiring unnecessary people) and instead look at how you can promote people within.

Many decisions made are political, with very little on the ground knowledge  helping to inform those decisions.
Focus is on how to get the most out of customers rather than providing products to meet customer needs. Sales teams have too many products to push, making it internally competitive for the marketing teams."

"8041","Depends where you land..TR is a huge company made up of a lot of small non-cooperating fiefdoms. Each unit has it's overlords and they're pro's at playing the ""you watch my back and I'll watch yours"" game.

So, net net, those that really know their stuff, usually don't get the promotions.

Very cliquey environment and advancement is primarily based on whose butt you kiss..

Also, this company practices agism... like nobody's business. Of all the job cuts in the past number of years(and there's been A LOT), it seems like the over 50's are the first to go. In fairness, this is a societal issue.

And going back to before the merger, both companies had a record of growing through acquisitions. And on the Reuters side, for some unexplained reason, the people who built the products/companies they bought, left after all the mergers. So, good luck getting something fixed for a client on a legacy platform."
"8042","They need to re-think the hiring/promotion process as the wrong people are landing in important slots. Of course, it's natural for a hiring manager to want input on such a decision but at TR, this is a dangerous practice. The higher ups at TR have no idea about the industry they're in so of course they shouldn't be called upon to judge hires for this essential quality. I can't tell you how many managers over there... couldn't tell you the difference between a CDS and CVS pharmacy..which would be funny if not for the fact that they sell to the financial industry."
"8043","But moving around, changing departments/channels and career path are the only way you'll get a pay increase. Management is disjointed within the company and nothing more than yes men. Upper level management can't seem to get a clear vision for the company and therefore hemorrhage VPs at an alarming rate. Products are in decline. Staff and sales executives are wholly underpaid for the market.  Bottom line emotes are... devalued and treated like cattle."
"8044","Besides paying your employees market value - Unify channels, and present a consistent corporate policy from bottom up.  There's nothing more alienating to employees when ""corporate policies"" are applied differently (or not at all) across departments and channels. Creates disgruntled, insecure culture."

"8048","Let people work instead of putting barrier after barrier."
"8049","Sometimes we spent too much time for a meeting  each day."
"8050","Company was a very large bureaucracy and with so many people in many disparate areas, it was a challenge to maintain facetime. Work from home is nice but TR had a mit of a problem with out of sight, out of mind mentality which caused many good folks to lose their jobs as execs in NY would make random determinations of who and from what offices should go. B/c it is a for profit company, short term profits became much... more important than building a long-term and growing organization. As a result, layoffs continue to occur even though at the outset of the Thomson Financial/Reuters merger, management stated that no more than 10% right-sizing would occur. At this point, I would bet it is closer to 40% or more."
"8051","The Board should oversee management and should engage more outside directors, as management has engaged in cost-savings approaches that have impacted the day-to-day employees through moving payment of bonuses out 3-4 months for the short term and one-time cost savings across the company, that ultimately make employees dissatisfied, lower morale and increase attrition of significant content manqagement and developent... skills and knowledge."

"8056","Work life balance is a struggle, Career progression is very slow."
"8057","Really bad health insurance, way too much red tape.  Directors and above are a bunch of yes men playing office politics from ivory towers.  1-3% raises are the norm, the attitude seems to be that you should feel great full to have a job.  Constant threat of outsourcing to India."
"8058","Quit and ruin some other company"
"8059","1) Lack of corporate strategy.  Managers managed through situations ONLY.  No aptitude for organizational planning or development.   My question to my manager about the company's strategic mission was met with a blank stare and maybe an UMMMM followed by awkward silence. 
2) Diminishing benefits/ Low Morale.  We found ourselves planning happy hours and ordering pizza to try to increase morale, because the things... that really made a difference to our staffers were lost in the large corporate machine.
3) Professionalism was often questioned.  
4) Best years are clearly behind this company.  We had 5 business unit heads in 8 years.  Each one had to come in and learn our business.  This constant cycle did not lend itself to the type of top-down support needed to reach aggressive revenue targets."
"8060","Staff that cannot share empathy to clients. Management rarely listening to staff about direction of firm. Little scope to progress with the HR the real masters of the universe."
"8061","Listen to your employees. Too many cuts too soon. Clients are ultimately the losers and facing the short term brunt of changes. Too much focus on the profit and loss and lacking and ignoring the relationship of the business."
"8062","Too many org changes
Many changes to sales comp plan that seemed to cap/control costs. Worked harder, sold more, but made less the last few years.
At times, management would reward people that fail with lower quota and increase quota for top performers."

"8080","Whilst data is what makes the big bucks at Thomson Reuters, the management should remember that its reputation and notoriety lies with the fantastic team of journalists that put great stories out every day and ensure the Reuters brand remains in the public eye. When I worked for the firm, I sensed the US management had little respect for the brand, in part because the Reuters name was not as big in the US as it is... elsewhere...perhaps that has changed since I left."

They simply couldn't afford those things any longer..then you would sit through a three hour long meeting listening to how great... the company is doing, how much it's growing and the fact that they ONLY made 12 billion (yes with a ""b"") in profits last year. They will push you and push you to sell more. If you do, they will find a way to fire you because they are paying you too much . If you don't, they will find a way to fire you  or make your life so miserable that you will quit as soon as you can.

One day there is no time to do anything, the other day two people are working on the same, and... when managers discover that, they just say 'it is good to have two heads thinking about a problem' (maybe it is, but not when there is no time for anything).

I also feel that my job (Manager level) is much more tactical... and administrative than it would be in other roles at similar sized companies.

"8471","Absolutely ZERO loyalty to its employees.  You can break your back for this company, work many overtime hours, and act as their slave, and you WILL be kicked to the curb at the drop of a hat!  If they can outsource your job, which is highly likely in IT, you will never feel comfortable and secure while working at Thomson.  Individual contributions above and beyond the job are NOT recognized.  You are simply a... number!  Raises are non-existent, and forget about bonuses.  TR is constantly shifting more of the employee costs to the employees.  You will be paying more and more for your benefits each year. 

If you like high stress situations, no recognition for your efforts, constant reorganizations, and the fear of losing your job on a weekly basis, then Thomson is for you.  Otherwise, avoid it like the plague!  I have been there close to twenty years and have seen this company take a nose dive.  Top management doesn't have a clue when it comes to human resource management!  Totally oblivious to what goes on beneath them, and couldn't care less.  I cannot even recall how many different people I have worked for.  Constant management changes completely disrupts and destroys the working environment.  Remote managers may never even meet you, but they can somehow accurately report on your performance.  Remote managers always favor employees that are local to them, and shaft everyone else.

I have several friends... that still work there, and can't believe that this company can get any worse.  The merger between Thomson and Reuters several years ago was the worst move ever made by Thomson.  Get a grip on your long term goals, plan out a long term strategy, and stick to it!

"8486","Management always confusing. During my 3 years here I found more than once a year of 're-organization' ,'management change', and 're-decision' to their business plan which impact pretty much with individual contributor (and manager will always say this would be the last, final, absolute final of change). 

I actually cannot remember exactly who is my senior manager nor my department's name as it changed in every... single year I stayed (also they're using abbreviate from GMS CTO GMI IAAS DCO TFX S&T and that's a lot of division while I stayed only 3 years). It feels no different for myself in term of report manager and role as my immediate manager still the same while the work is not.

Also the company does not really care about their individuals yet their managers are their treasure. I don't think this is a good stuff when it comes to real business and you can see that is why the big things keep changing here. From CEO to their organization chart yet they still using most of the same person while rotating them from a role to another. Being honest here this is not a wise decision if a company really needs an improvement. TR needs a LOT more clearer vision and management team. Do things sharper.

This is pretty much impact in company performances. I think the results are already showed. Bloomberg already getting ahead of this company many steppes while Thomson Reuters still.. 'preparing themselves' for years since their merging.

Last thing I would like to add is company did suffer a lot from their staffs. I saw a lot of 'dismissal' which often calls 'reorganizing' 'resizing' 'reduce costs' and whatsoever. And this happens more than twice during my time there. This absolutely made their staffs fearing their status. (and yes, 3,000 staffs dismissal at 2013 is not a joke while 2011 and 2012 also did some of dismissal already) Question here is, why still recruiting another when company still needs to fire people after they got hired from a few months to a few years? Some kind of this organization's culture needs to improve.

I wish their new CEO (I was in Glocer era and James Smith just taken his place for only a few months) would re-arrange this matters and hoping they'll becomes 'rival' to Bloomberg once again."
"8487","Stated above. Grow up."
"8488","Did not see any cons."
"8489","Not bad, but people are too cold"
"8490","More creations"
"8491","Chaos, disorganization, poor leadership, constantly shifting and competing strategies, no innovation, poor benefits, the list goes on. 

When they say the only certain things in life are death and taxes, they haven't worked for Thomson Reuters financial and risk business. Here, the other certainty is that there will be a new ""executive strategy"" delivered every six months with a re-org as part of the process.... There is no such thing as real innovation in this business. Thomson Reuters notoriously acquires smaller companies to fill the product line gaps and rarely integrates well. Instead, the preference is to create ""optics"", a smoke screen illusion that all is well in the Land of the Deaf and Dumb and there is a plan, somewhere, a plan does exist and someone is executing on it so well you don't even realize it's happening. (Smile and nod like a good little drone.)

One step forward....  You can literally kill yourself working towards a goal and see it shatter in moments. This is due to a highly ""matrixed"" organization where no one has figured out who is on first. There are a whole lot of indians but very few real chiefs who will stand up, make a decision and take ownership of that decision. You will count away  minutes and hours of your life spent in meetings and conference calls that result in very little, if any, progress. Some teams you work with are massive, with each person owning some little slice of the pie. This makes ""progress"" akin to wading through molasses. Other teams are tiny, with no investment, and those folks work until their hands bleed for very little appreciation. And yet, there are no moves made to better align teams, define roles and trim the fat where needed. Learn to love chaos and a disorganized organization.

Be prepared with work with little or no budget for major projects. This is a reality for most segments within the Financial and Risk business. Though it's been a sinking ship for the past several years, the business keeps dumping money into further development of Eikon in the hopes of ""unseating"" Bloomberg in the trading terminal business. No amount of re-positioning of the messaging can change the fact that it is, at heart, a trading terminal and Bloomberg has the corner on that market... yet they persist. So, as money is being funneled by the truckload into that development do not expect any investment in other areas.

Advancement opportunities are radically different based on your location, business unit and direct manager. There is no progression planning that I've ever seen, nor any management training. In my previous business unit there was opportunity to advance, without pay increase, but at least there was opportunity to grow. Within financial and risk, your growth is entirely determined by your manager as the organizational structure is constantly shifting. 

As an organization with over 50,000 employees, one would think Thomson Reuters would provide excellent benefits both in terms of the standard health, 401k as well as additional ""talent retention"" perks. Not the case. While the health benefits aren't terrible, with 3 levels of plans to choose from, as of last year the company turned over more of the healthcare expense to employees resulting in most plans doubling in cost to the employee. What cost you $90.00 per paycheck last year now costs $180 (single employee, under 40, no dependents). 401K matching is meager with a vesting plan that extends out 5 years. Maternity/Paternity benefits are below average for US based employees as is vacation. Other benefits? I haven't seen any. Morale is consistently low, the annual employee survey consistently shows employees are dissatisfied with feeling valued and with benefits, and management's response is consistently the same: ""We hear you, but nothing is changing.""

Thomson Reuters is, in my opinion, a perfect example of a bloated corporation, the publicly traded version of the US government."
"8492","Learn what it means to actively listen to employees and respond. Trust the experts you've hired and allow them to help guide the business forward. I haven't met a single executive thought leader while working here, so give credit where credit is due - to the employees who actually develop the ideas you call your own. Promote those who have real leadership skills or, invest in management training and make it a... requirement for promotion at any level. Recognize that if an executive failed in one business unit, they will likely do no better as an executive in another business unit.Define real roles with opportunity for growth and cut the fat. Make decisions about strategy and direction and stick with them for more than 6 months. Finish a task. If you acquire a company, fully integrate employees, products, marketing, finance etc. If you launch a re-org, make sure that it's complete before moving on to the next big idea."

"8538","Give the voice to employees."
"8539","Big, bureaucratic and compensation is inconsistent across the same position. My experience is that management puts up a false front - pretending to be compassionate, empathetic and communicative with its employees - and it is on the surface. But digging deeper they are comfortable in their box - they will change a bit but still only within their box. The culture is strange - non entrepreneurial."
"8540","Be more communicative on an individual level with your employees. Attempt to retain employees who know your product rather than let them fly the coop. They are your greatest resource! Take some individual responsibility to retain and guide your staff. Don't rely on your computer generated forms to evaluate employees just for the sake of compliance with some bogus adopted and questionable standards."
"8541","The company clearly does not care about its customer facing positions such as reference attorneys, tech support and customer service.  The latter of the two they simply outsource as much as they can, and skeleton staff the US based reps.  Since they cannot outsource the Reference Attorneys they run the department on the cheap so they can have as little staff as possible, while not making the large law firm customers... wait too long on hold.  The salary is a joke.  It was probably a good salary 30 yrs ago when many law school tuition rates were below 10K per year.  The ""merit increases"" which the company only gives if it does not lose too much money due to stupid management decisions does not even cover a cost of living increase.  And because the company considers the RSA department an entry level position, it does not matter if you are there for 1 year or 10 years, you will never get a significant bump in salary.  Because they get a lot of people to apply because of a horrible MN legal job market and too many law schools in the area there is no flexibility when it comes to the position, policies of the department, salary etc.  

You will simply be an employee number to them and that is it.  If you talk to the managers ""off the record"" they will admit the company and the department considers the employees replaceable parts and that they can make the job as bad as they want because there are always plenty of people looking for a foot in the door to the company.  If you do take the job, start planning your exit immediately.  Identify the part of the company you want to go to and start networking and get your name out there.  If you do not have interest in staying with the company long term I would put it like this...If you are, or about to be, homeless or starving take the job.  If not, do not bother with it."
"8542","Like is the case with Amazon.com, every employee including senior management should have to take a week long shift in a customer service position (including taking the pay level for that week).  Then you can see the ramifications of the way you staff those positions on the customers and the employees.  Every attorney working for the company should have to take a week long shift as an RSA so they actually know the... products."

"8546","The Business side (non-IT) of Thomson does not/did not realize the value that MIS teams provided in the application and operations support.  Because of this, upper level management (CIO - 1) never became aware of the full functions that these teams served.  In the end, this same management believed that these individuals were easily replaceable with TCS consultants.  1200 highly skilled SAP and IT systems analysts... let go, some after 30 years of service to a company.  Beware what is the new Thomson Reuters and what is their new cultural value: Stock value.  The layoff ""savings"" will serve as a short term stock buy-back of 1billion USD."

A woman that started the company 44 years ago was packed and out in 20 minutes."
"8632","Rampant politics, often exacerbated by long-time employees who have not grown skills outside their particular department. Additionally, pay is lower than other organizations and internal hiring does not always lead to the most appropriate leadership decisions and development."
"8633","Because the company has grown through acquisitions and because it is tremendously large, there seemed to be a lot of duplication of effort, and it could be difficult to navigate your way through the organization to get things done. Personal relationships are often how things are accomplished in business, and that can be particularly difficult in a global company, especially when there are significant restrictions on... travel and limited opportunity to engage with colleagues face-to-face in other locations. I believe this also impeded my ability to make a career move, as I did not have a lot of opportunity to make a positive impression on others in key locations, such as New York."

"8637","The Thomson acquisition was the beginning of the end.  I've been working in big bad Corporate America for a while now.  I've seen entire divisions wiped out due to market downturns (read tech bubble crash).  I've seen highly profitable business units take the headcount ax during merger and acquisitions gone wrong.  But this was the first time I've seen a profitable, efficient, lean, mean, mature, smart  American... brand be completely decimated by slash and burn murders and decapitations style global capitalism.  Here's the story we've all heard about in the news, but which I had the displeasure of seeing up close at the scene of the accident:  Big global monster of a company with multiple, incongruous business units (Thomson) has a ton of cash.  But how to increase earnings each quarter to keep the analysts happy and my stock options going up this year asks the senior manager?  Growth through acquisitions is the answer.  But acquisitions wasn't quite enough.  How do you then ""create synergies"" among your new businesses where there is some overlap?  Layoffs is the answer.  Ok.  Hey, I get it.  You're running a business and have two people doing the same job in two different cities.  But wait, that's not quite enough to keep those senior management bonuses coming.  We've got margin improvement to show.  We've got EBITDA numbers to manipulate.  Now how do you do that?  Innovation?  New products?  Nope . . . offshoring.  Hey, it worked for Dell customer service right?  Oh wait, no that was actually a disaster, but what the heck, I'm not hanging around here more than a year anyway thinks the senior manager.  If I can cut costs, and show margin improvement by clearing a floor of tenured, highly regarded industry experts that the US and Global mutual fund communities have grown to know and love, and then replace them with dopplegangers in Mumbai, Bangkok, and Manilla at a third of the cost, things are looking good for me at year end.  And what's even better I can sell this story of ""realizing synergies"" to the next company I intended to gut!  Bloody brilliant strategy mate."

I suspect I will be gone in December 2014, never to work or to contribute to the economy again. 

It is incredible that the senior management are so... intellectually bankrupt that they have lapped-up everything that the Eikon management have sold them. (That is the flagship product, widely regarded by most as a piece of junk). The management actually, seriously believe that closing-down anything that isn't Eikon.....simply because it isn't Eikon.......is actually a good plan, even if those other products have loyal customer bases, and generate millions of dollars. 

I think the bottom line, echoed in other reviews, is that the management genuinely don't care about their employees, from the level of the most trivial thing, up to the most major. I suspect a lot of this is down to incompetence and the desire to save money, rather than any personal vindictiveness. For example, at the trivial level, people with 10-years long service awards sit next to people with 18 or 19 years service who have never received one. At the larger level, ex-Thomson employees are always made redundant in preference  to ex-Reuters employees, as the former have their redundancy payments capped. The feeling of unease and mistrust this creates is almost palpable. 

And never underestimate the ability of the company to be downright crass. An e-mail of 8 paragraphs begins with 7 paragraphs of how great and wonderful the company is doing, and how brilliant everyone is, is then followed up by a final paragraph announcing 3000 redundancies for no good reason.

"8849","If customers truly are at the heart of everything, then align your resources in such a fashion.  Put your people in front of those customers instead of creating such a high level of organizational and operational complexity that their needs are never truly met."
"8850","Talking about Financial & Risk division. What is written in the other reviews is absolutely true: this company is always finding a good excuse to re-organise at least every year. You can have great career opportunities so long as you're well politically positioned and based in the major centers (NYC, London in essence). Management seem to have been recruited on the same mould: they do not (don't know how to) listen.... They're all after their own numbers, short term and maintain the organization's structure so no dissonant voice can be heard (let's not even talk about HR...).
In fact, this is more than ever about greed: spending less and less yet seeking more and more, effectively driving people by fear (I don't think it's intentional but rather the result of some people's incompetence).
Hence the regular major marketing campaign in this company: yearly layoffs (contractors welcome to do the work that the people laid off were doing).
Nonetheless, the senior management commonly shows great sense of humour: a staff survey is released every year asking if staff believe that senior management cares about the well-being of their employees."

In some business units and in product development areas many of the middle level managers... lack ability to think the big picture and groom smart talented folks who are honed in new technical and business skills.  It is not uncommon to see many folks with advanced degrees from Ivy league schools working in lower ranks for people (old timers) who are far less skilled and not in tune with newer technologies.

Unfortunately, these... introverted ""yes"" men become managers at PLC and they bring their lack of good judgment and social skills with them.

Basically, Thomson Reuters talks a good talk, but there is no action to back it up."

Also, consistently upping quotas, while dropping commission rates while... keeping the targeted compensation the same sucks for morale and has made it hard to be a positive employee.

August-October are more deadlines so you are only left a few decent months to sell."

The culture reminds me a lot of high school."
"9061","Seminars on improving managerial, communication, and professional courtesy skills would vastly improve working conditions for all."
"9062","Very corporate. Employees are ok but not the best of the best, mostly because they were hired through acquisitions of companies that didn't have the clout to attract ""the best of the best"". Strategy unclear. Want to be a fully integrated company but not willing to take a hit on margins to invest in organic growth and people (engineers, intrapreneurs, etc.) who can actually execute on this strategy, so they end up... buying companies that are just ok, with just ok employees."
"9063","Hire smarter and be clear about your strategy. If you don't have the human resources to pull it off and can't compromise margins to do this because of fear of the market (or family shareholders) then go private or change your strategy. Being a portfolio holding company worked for Thomson because there was clarity in the goal/vision.

"9287","Some lower-level managers in the User Services group make working feel exceptionally micro-managed, and like you are undervalued, at times degraded, and have to walk on eggshells.   Policy and a single poorly-calculated raw number dictates if you are doing well or failing.  This is true regardless of how appropriate the policy is for a given situation, or the rationality behind the policy.  The single number that... defines your work does not account for any other side projects you perform (and these additional projects make your target number more difficult to obtain) nor does it include other less-tangible gifts one offers or things one completes to better him/herself or the company.   This sharply contrasts with the high-level management's message of WHAT is right and not WHO is right.

To put in a nutshell there is no dignity and decency left in p3. There is bias wrt gender, age, looks and marital status. Constant harrassment for those who have no Godfather. Senior Management is just a puppet in the hands of managers who have formed their favorites. Sister of an existing AM got promoted to senior associate in one year only, cos her assignements Quality Check everything was taken care of. Its all about ass licking.

When you have pay increases which have fallen far below the pace of inflation, increased work hours and an increased cost for health insurance, you tend to look  for other jobs. This is especially upsetting knowing our division has been very profitable despite the economic downturn.... The day-to-day operations with customers are typically handled without management's knowledge. This can go on for years and makes it difficult when evaluating employees. An employee can work with clients to achieve wonderful things, but no one else in the company may come to realize it.  With Thomson, the glass is always 1% empty with a ""what have you done for me today"" attitude."

"9395","It's fine to acquire new companies to expand your footprint, but it is equally important to have the foresight to integrate those companies in a seamless way to avoid internal conflicts and a confused image to the world outside. It's extremely important to realize the effect on your sales, solutions, business units and professional services staff when they are torn between which product to sell as the internal... offerings conflict each other and there is way too much internal backstabbing between the sales teams as a result they become a barrier from making the sales happen. The wrong alignments and unnecessary number of sales managers have repeatedly caused the teams to lose business. The sales managers are not able to even go in front of the client and sell or pitch the company's offering. There is no one to give a client the comfort level that their SLA's will be met.

Appoint more women in leadership positions. It's been observed again and again, since the acquisition in 2008, many competent women left the company. The ones who are around have been  filling in administrative roles. Without promoting competent and young women to the fore-front, you have no role models.  

Lastly, you cannot have square pegs in round holes to lead a vertical. A legal head will not be effective in leading the financial group as the dynamics are different for both industries.

When Thomson bought Reuters it bought a dog that couldn't hunt for a premium price right when the financial sector was heading south. The synergies never emerged and the result is a large dysfunctional behemoth heavy on management layers that spends most it time redrawing org charts and not understanding why the org charts have... nothing to do with how things actually work -when they work. With poor financial performance the company has turned to cost cutting and layoffs to try and boost the bottom line. Morale in many offices is low and with the overall economy showing even modest improvement some people have begun to depart on their own for better pastures."

Most of the control elsewhere. Excellent performance was overlooked repeatedly. Considerable amount of politics. Very few people with good technical knowhow. Very weak management in India. India office only playing also rans rather than a... trendsetter. Lot of blaming Indian employees, back stabbing. Its very convenient to blame employees in India and get on with the status quo. Management does not take responsibility whatsoever. Only technical people are blamed for anything. Considerable politics at the office. Also, no diversity in hiring. HR was useless."

- Trainings are often superficial and one has to deal with many responsibilities... despite the lack of knowledge: team leaders are fully aware of that
- The company recently cut all costs so managers decided to hire only interns to make them do the work of the employees: after six months the history repeats and the ones who stay have to train new ones over and over, not mentioning the lack of expertise (of the new ones and some old ones too)"

"9512","Lately, upper management within TR has been highly focused on ""cost cutting"" with a blind eye to the negative consequences of doing so. The most glaring example has been numerous benefit cuts over the last few months - poor health plan offerings for such a large company (not far off from what could be purchased privately for a healthy family), no more vacation carryover, much smaller raises in recent years than were... offered when I first joined the company. There is too much ""standardization"" going on; more successful parts or functions of the company are not allowed to offer better pay/benefits to remain competitive in the marketplace. It is ironic to receive two e-mails the same day, one from upper management describing the latest benefit cut, and another from lower level technology recruiting eager for ideas to help attract and retain quality technology employees. A few years ago, a decision was made to move a lot of development work to Bangalore, India. Fortunately, this was done without requiring a mass layoff of employees in Eagan, but I have noticed the work coming out of Bangalore is lower quality, and working on projects that require regular correspondence with India staff slows down progress on projects due to the time zone difference. Parking at the Eagan campus requires you to walk a long distance unless you are a higher level manager, visitor, or part of a carpool. There is no bump in granted vacation time between your 5th and 20th service anniversary, which seems too long.

I am guessing most software developers in the Twin Cities area could find options for a prospective employer that would provide a better pay/benefits package, still encourage the use of cutting edge technologies, and provide a better overall corporate atmosphere than Thomson Reuters. The local technology market is very hot right now, and recent corporate decisions are blind to this fact."

"9514","There is so much focus on the ""next"" product that the current ones are suffering through constant layoffs, lack of focus, and lethargic management. The strategic product get tons of resources while the legacy products are being left to die.

"9520","People seem to want to stay under the radar here. No one works very hard and people don't seem to want to innovate or be open to new ideas. Even though the company is doing poorly, they don't want to change the way they do things. They reward employees who are poor performers. The sales team gets iPads, trips and other bonuses even when they are not performing well. People are incredibly unfriendly and cliquey. ... There is no opportunity for growth here. Many of the senior level managers and executives have been here for a decade or more and they are completely out of touch with their employees and the market.  They take input on products or strategies because they think what they have been doing for the past 10 years is the right way, even though the industry has changed dramatically.  The managers I have come into contact with are the ultimate micro-managers, going so far as to monitoring who you socialize with.  It's dreadful."
"9521","When you ask for feedback from the field, listen to it with an open mind rather than becoming defensive. If you ask someone to perform a task (or do their job), let them do it. When employees tell you they are scared to speak up about the culture, the diminishing benefits, the poor morale and the poor managers, you should figure out how to address this instead of sweeping it under the rug."

Management sets decent strategies, but has no patience to put in the effort to measure their success or go into the details of execution. This leads to people... pulling in different directions.
This might not be the case in all verticals of the company, but in mine, brown-nosing and bragging was the only way to get ahead. Management didn't know how to measure employee effectiveness."

I suppose this is partly due to the economic situation, but with no salary increase this year and health care benefits costing more with less coverage, a large percentage of employees have effectively taken a 5% paycut this year.  Little support for career growth from management.  New food service provider is not as good and more expensive."

There are opportunities for career changes but lot depends on how well connected you are... at the top and side wards. Fend for yourself, wolf pack culture. Inter department competition is healthy but inter-department hatred is counter productive. Management does not interact one to one with everyone they are at a distance from the people at the bottom,  your manager is god or untouchable. Too much information but difficult to find it quickly when you need it urgent.  Many examples of good hardworking and super skilled people not treated well left the organization...whereas less skilled but well connected and politically sharp people going up. Company has too much focus on growth than retention..expectations of growth are sometimes unrealistic. Retention strategies are not good enough. Good company for bachelors...than family.  New products not good enough and not gone through robust QA process. Bad times in financial services are far from over. Less collaboration between teams. Sales makes more noise by false cancellation threats and often give non commissionable services for free. Technical teams are sometimes too rigid and process oriented need to be more flexible. Years of hard work does not always pay, reporting lines change often and nobody cares what you did in longterm. Some very senior and successful staff dont like share knowledge and information easily, but this is not the case with everyone. Jobs are becoming too monotonous, and task oriented, less intelligence and experienced people required."
"9709","Invest less on managers and more front end staff.  Business retention and future growth is possible with good experienced front end resources who meet the actual customers. Front end resources with good knowledge and experience are difficult to replace with fresh blood. A front end staff costs far less than a Manager yet the value he provides against competition encroachment is not measurable with statistical... numbers. Outsourcing is not always the best solution, often SLA's measurement stats provided to management can be misleading and harmful for the business in long run. Loading up and pressurizing front ends increases quantity of work which is measurable but reduces the quality and end user experience which is not easily measurable and by the time it is realized it may be too late.  Beware of Managers who follow task master culture, such individuals may be able to project themselves well but they may not be good for growth and retention of future leaders working under them.  Strong voices often suppress the silent geniuses, who are no less capable.  Managers should be measured and made accountable for the staff retention rate in his team.  Manager/Management methods should be monitored not just to his immediate superior but also by a completely impartial and neutral global team. Sales deals should be regulated and monitored by global standards team, as temporary gains may help the local targets but may not necessarily good for the global organisational growth. Not following standards can lead to long term damage of organisational growth. Do not make drastic and quick changes, changes should be made in planned and phased manner. Companies should take care their decision should not conflict with the needs of staff and their family needs.  More flexible infrastructure that can change quickly with the need of the hour.  Stop wolf pack culture. Study required - did switch actually fail or was switch made to fail due self interests. People still in the company for 18+ years, are not flexible and find difficult to accept change and work with other people. Be realistic in your projections. Good product QA required increase QA team resources. Need to improve ways in which information can be easily be made available when needed. Motivate the staff ensure they are less stressed.

"9806","-This company lay's off employees all the time and because they spread it out over the year no one realizes how many employees are actually let go. 
-The dirty little secret about this company is that they constantly reorganize the business and never give the last reorganization a chance to work.  Some of the changes they make are similar to past reorganizations.
-Their idea of a raise is 0-1% for the last several... years, no matter how hard you worked. The whole time they report record profits.
-It is all about the current year win and no one cares about the future unless you are not in management."
"9807","The culture needs to change, this used to be an employer of choice and in the last 4-5 years it has become a horrible place for anyone to work."
"9808","Some of the management does not promote talent. Too many old-timers that do the minimum and slide under the radar"

"9811","Mediocre salary
Insanely long hours
Poor morale"
"9812","This company has burned out their best and brightest who have moved on. You need to rethink the organization and focus less on process and CYA meetings from 6am to 6pm so people can actually work."
"9813","Employees with 5+ years of experience are still in the same position doing the same process. There is no growth for your career."
"9814","Come in molte grandi compagnie, le procedure burocratiche possono essere tediose e il taglio dei costi può essere frustrante."
"9815","Il taglio dei costi ha causato frustrazioni. Ridurre i livelli direttoriali intermedi e semplificare la struttura organizzativa (capigruppo, team-leader, manager locali, ecc. sono probabilmente titoli troppo comuni)."
"9816","A lot of restructuring, been working here now for 10 years and it has been restructured 7 times. This is starting to get on many peoples nerves"
"9817","Thomson Reuters is a content company trying to be a enterprise software company and failing at it. Limited marketing leadership, unreachable revenue targets, multiple Thomson Reuter brands piling on client contacts without a unified approach."
"9818","Focus on the ""big picture"", fix the above before going after individual contributors as the culprits to your failings."

"9827","Work load should be proper"
"9828","WIth the scale so large, even the smallest of changes becomes a large undertaking. The Eagan, MN campus while nice is lacking of amenities compared to other large corporate campuses. In the technical organization, positions are very siloed, so branching out of your area can be a bit more difficult than other places."
"9829","Add some nice amenities to the Eagan campus (home to nearly 7000 employees) such as a minute clinic or beverages beyond coffee. Be more aware of headcount constraints and get people into positions a bit quicker."

"9835","No training program, lack of leadership."
"9836","Rapid (almost to a fault) execution and distribution of products and plans where implementation not always as smooth as could be desired.  Bureaucratic machine.  Size and scope (pro as well as con).  Incessant aquisitions and strategic shifts result in constant re-organization and (in) stability issues."
"9837","Increase QA of procesess and product releases.  Take greater input from ""front-line"" employees.  Resist drive to so quickly act."
"9838","The business units are run like personal fiefdoms.  There is no recognition for cross-selling.  If your manager has a personal bias against you, you have no recourse not even to the hapless Human Resources Department."
"9839","You haven't sold your business plan yet to the many who would endeavor to fulfill it.  Weekly or even monthly e-mails lack a personal touch.  I do not think the management is listening as opposed to dictating"

"9853","Big companies can be slow movers."
"9854","its very difficult to grow in this company. promotions are based on bias attituted of higher management."
"9855","quality of work should matter rather then years spent in the company  for promotion"
"9856","Poor vision benefits.  Very difficult to advance your position and salaries are low.  No cost of living salary increases while upper management receives 6 figure bonuses.  All levels of management have no clue as to how to properly set clients' expectations."
"9857","No Transparency in HR. Lack of proper One on One."
"9858","A lot of internal restructuring, Negative implications when hiring on contractual basis"
"9859","- When planning another restructuring, test the executional part of the plan before the actual execution. A lot of problem may arise if not done properly, which may affect the employees' motivation and trust.

- When a new product/service is launched, do not release it with a big word of mouth before making sure that the product is ready to speak for itself.

- Client servicing dpt and processes can be... furthermore perfected."
"9860","Entire team was made up of low caliber people who had been promoted purely on tenure --- from VP to SVP to EVP. No concept of six sigma, best practice (or even average practice). Both professional and personal ethics and style of management was the worst I ever experienced. Misrepresentation, passing off of low quality work, inaccuracy was the name of the game. They are decades behind their competitors and finally... their slipping market share is showing it."
"9861","Perform a comprehensive performance analysis of employees by professionals outside TR. Get rid of non-performers. Hire good talent from outside the company or its acquisitions."
"9862","Terrible Pay scale
Biased Senior Managers 
Wrong Policy decisions
Employee needs are not given any importance"

"9876","Terminate employees who under-perform and reward those who perform above expectation."
"9877","The upper mgmt is terrible and clueless"
"9878","Learn about the product before making foolish plans"
"9879","I have nothing to say"
"9880","It's a great place to work for. The only negative that I see may not even be a negative. Similar to most large organizations or corporations, the decision making process is slow due to all the layers of management in a world wide organization."
"9881","Thomson hires people as contract-to-hire to weed out those candidates that have a life.
The contract companies Thomson exclusively uses are no-benefit, no-day-off, stingy companies who do not stand with or by the people they hire.
Employees are given a couple of days to listen to the unhelpful full-timers then expected to learn massive systems within days. If the prospective employee isn't a Michael Jordan, they... are unceremoniously laid off by email.
Contractors (even those intended for future hire) are treated as third-class citizens - working hard as full-time Thomson employees: arrive late; leave early; take long lunches."
"9882","Hire people who are team players.
Scrap the sweat-shop ""contract companies"": at least find contract companies who treat the contractors as valuable assets
Support developers by spending actual dollars to have a staff of development support for build, deploy, and tool maintenance.
Get RID of full-time employees who are no better than career USPS paper pushers. The company is full of sloth-like non-producers....
Think about this: the people who work for you will rock and roll if you treat them like humans with lives and families and actual human qualities.
Look into automated development environment setup, perhaps use Virtual Machine servers that are push-button-create environments."
"9883","Career growth is not quite good. Many ppl are stuck at engineering level. Moreover, the company is suffering with profit drop which cause the lay off this year."
"9884","The benefits used to be much better before the merger but that might be because of the times, things are pretty bad for the financial industry and it really hit TR's bottom line. 
Depending on what area one works in, recent dramatic changes in management meant layoffs mostly for people with seniority and an opinion.  New managers changed processes completely and hired mostly college students to cut cost... but I... guess it will save the company money, in the near term. 
Used to be able to work from home some days but that has been completely eliminated.  Now everyone has to be in the office even if you have late night calls with your team in Asia.  I thought companies in general are leaning more and more towards dispersed teams that telecommute, but no longer at TR... dispersed maybe, but you still have to waste highly valuable real estate in Times Square and be there every day."
"9885","You might want to consider flattening your corporate structure somewhat... 5+ layers of management can be quite counterproductive to getting things done. 
Take a look down the management ladder and see if everyone is 'really' doing a good job."
"9886","Bureaucracy  of many processes due to a huge company size"
"9887","Nothing to specify...Negotiate nicely before you join."
"9888","Pay and advancement opportunities could be better"
"9889","Pay for attorney editors could be more in line with the fact that, without them, the company would not be where it is."
"9890","Sometimes difficult to move across channels and segments"
"9891","Don't change what is not broken"
"9892","Data analyst in content is  90% copy paste work. Recommended only for graduates and no longer then 1 year. Low salaries without hikes. Inexperienced management  with 2-3 years of experience.
Little growth opportunities."
"9893","Promote for employees to move from team to team, be more honest about development and growth opportunities"
"9894","Some middle managers are weak  so you need to be lucky about whom you report to sometimes.  They are always selling divisions and companies there.  Beware if yours is sold."
"9895","Think about keeping the good companies rather than selling them"
"9896","No Talent Management
Lack of direction
Extremely political and skewed to ex Thomson senior leadership"
"9897","Need to stop so much change in the markets division
Need to have stronger Talent Management programs"
"9898","Less Growth Opportunities. Internal Job Posting is not as promised(within 12 months) during induction and there are few opportunities as well."
"9899","Increase growth opportunities for existing employees to retain them."
"9900","Most people there do not get raise in salary in past several years (after the merger).  Personal changing in upper management are surprisingly fast lately, which giving people the unstable feeling."
"9901","Should focus more on innovation and product quality."
"9902","- Poor salary and compensation, HR is an enemy that seeks to minimize pay even if manager argues in your favor.  Excuses for sub-inflation based raises, even after great year.
- Huge corporate bureaucracy
- Very little room for advancement/growth, no merit based recognition
- Plenty of incompetent coworkers who's only strength is having been there 10 years
- Reliance on poor technology infrastructure and support... of legacy platforms
- Heavy offshoring in recent years, frequently with attitude that ""10 mediocre/poor offshore resources are still cheaper than 2 stellar local resources""."
"9903","HR lacks ability to compete at market-price for salaries - the bar is their own take on ""what's fair"". Recent changes/projects has burned some people out and company struggling to attract new talent. Prior few year's cost-cutting focus (not balanced with growth strategies) has been a motivation killer."
"9904","Changing focus to new growth initiatives is great, but remember your employees as well - become an employer of choice for individuals again (remember employees aren't just a ""head-count"" of cattle)"
"9905","Not enough emphasis on individual performance means there are too many people who are experts at finding a different group to punt problems to rather than actually contributing
Too many groups are incapable of seeing beyond their tightly defined areas of responsibility.
No evidence that direction given from the top actually translates to action at the bottom. 
Poor management more concentrated on in-fighting with... peers than in building a business.
Terrible morale in markets division"
"9906","The company is extremely large so it can be difficult to change direction or implement new projects.  There has been a distinct lack of accountibility for decision makers, and management does not place enough value on recruiting the best of the best.  While the company has great values on paper they do not always translate into the best practices."
"9907","Do not be afraid to try something new, but test, test, test.  It is better to do something right and have a higher chance of success than to rush something to market."
"9908","less exposure to current skills"
"9909","should give promotions as per skills & not as per the no of years completed in the role"
"9910","No part time, poor decisions from senior management."
"9911","Pay less than competitors, benefits decreasing"
"9912","poor management, hellish culture in organisation, lack of professional expertise in many division."
"9913","Difficult industry to be in, management turmoil, lots of systems in place but not efficiently managed"
"9914","Speak to your people more, get into the trenches and understand what makes them tick and motivate them properly. Then they will stay for longer."
"9915","The con of working for Thomson Reuters is that the company really does not care about the employees, and the pay is very limited."
"9916","Poor middle and upper management - lack leadership and motivational skills.  Low employee morale.  Benefits are mediocre at best.  Satellite office with little room for advancement."
"9917","Get new management.  Products are a mess with no long term strategy in sight."
"9918","No merit based on accomplishment
Personal relationships drive opportunity
No real learning culture
No investment in people"

"9922","Simplification in the organization would make a tremendous difference in delivery."
"9923","Hign turnover, management always changing, lower on pay scale, many times the right hand doesn't know what the left has done."
"9924","implement 360 reviews for all management."
"9925","1. Highly political atmosphere
2. Senior Managers and above are inexperienced in the jobs that they oversee
3. Limits your career opportunities post working here"
"9926","Should go to a management school. Read 7 habits of highly effective people. Treat employees like humans, not slaves"
"9927","The software development is still an inhouse style. The job is mainly for doing maintenance works with the existing software that Reuters have. The product is built on obsoleted coding technology such as C on UNIX. There is totally no new product development and learning of the new business industry. The competition from Bloomberg is serious and Reuters couldn't make its products competitive enough to take market... shares from Bloomberg. I believe in the long run Reuters could be out of the market."
"9928","Eikon is still a choice and it could not live up to the competition from Bloomberg. While there are plenty of great Project Managemers in Thailand but the recruited Project Managers staff at Reuters Thailand site don't seem to have enough knowledge. The problem could be due to the HR recruitment process that fails to check the experience of the hired staff."
"9929","Inside print sales team competes against online store, outside sales reps, and other internal sales units.
Plenty of online product training, but no time during workday to complete it.
Have to go through ""boot camp"" before you can receive a territory.
Most sales positions use a more short-term transactional model and are not consultative; can get boring."
"9930","Hire sales professionals, shorten the boot camp experience, and let them do what they already know how to do--sell.

Change the current sales model so that employees are working together and not competing against each other."
"9931","Can't change shift timings and work from home is not accepted without putting leave."
"9932","As a large company it often takes too long for new ideas to make it to the marketplace. Organizational changes take a long time to complete and can be disruptive to the business at times, but for the most part work carries on until there is an official directive to make a change."
"9933","There needs to be better recognition of employee's effort and proper compensation for those efforts.  It should not be expected that one needs to leave and then come back to get a raise or promotion! (HR does advise this course for career advancement!)"
"9934","Compensation not the best in the industry
Does not attract the best talent
Negative impact of financial markets meltdown"
"9935","Just turning out to be another company, not much difference client based companies in terms of benefits to employees and other learning activities"
"9936","Even a basic ITIL certification voucher is cancelled, its like paralyzing an employees knowledge level.  Should understand an employees need and have transparent platform to communicate in the case of internal movement."
"9937","Lack of good leadership.  Directors and other Senior Management  ""play games"" with their staff and offices to work around their own agenda's.  No equality in work life balance, feeling of success or work load.  Most Management ""in it for themselves""; been provided big egos and empowered themselves to be and do what they want...not necessarily what is in the best interest of the office or staff."
"9938","Wake up.  Good, Excellent people are leaving this company.  It would be a wonderful place to work.  Stop exploiting your own agenda and let's all work together for the common good of all and the company."
"9939","Over protective of the news agency (it affects all lines of business)."

"9941","salary is not competive, compare with other it company"
"9942","none"
"9943","Poor management lacking business nous
Petty politics

Every year the company cuts significant number of sales force - each November.  This has been going on for at least 4 years, but was hidden from the public.  While criticizing its competitors like... Lexis-Nexis Reed Elsevier and others, it follows the exact same strategy that they follow which TR criticizes.  A lot of pressure to hit sales each and every month.  Quota has been increased so much that it appears management is either trying to forcibly make the sales force miss quota to not have to pay them bonuses, etc. or they simply don't know what they are doing, or they are desperate and keep projecting crazy numbers so higher ups in the executive committee don't fire them.  It is expected that every 2.5 to 3 years a major shake up occurs to management - the new VP or Director comes in and promises change, but only cut salaries and potential comp and do nothing else really.  This used to be a well oiled, fine tuned bad a** sales force - it has been completely demoralized and many, many well qualified sales people have left, been put on PIP and forced out, and/or simply quit.  It is shocking the number of people who go on ""disability"" because they resent the company so much they actually just need some time off before they quit or get fired.  This is the direct fault of management and probably costs the company an arm and a leg, but management is so underwhelmingly inside the box, they do nothing to change any root causes of this type of behavior - that would mean they would have to admit the company has been misguided.  I could go on and on.  The environment is toxic.  Sales people used to get pensions, used to have a possibility of moving up - but not now.  Even if you are good at what you do, some lazy manager has the ability to pin you to your job and pay level for the rest of your life if he/she wants, and they would never want to lose a decent sales person, so hence, you will never have the chance to move up."
"10137","Fire yourself.  Don't keep using the slash and burn standard operating procedure of a company on the way down.  The product is good - management should have the cojones to stand behind it and the sales force and not rely on slashing compensation to hit revenue targets - that is not sales - that is lazy!  Meanwhile, everyone at the top keeps getting raises and more and more.  Largesse at the top and unhappy people at... the bottom - never spells for a happy ending.  Tom Glocer - CEO of the entire company (TR) until Dec 2012, just left with a exit package worth about $30 million AFTER he is guaranteed lifetime private jets for him and his family (and nannies) and had luxury penthouses paid for him in both New York and London.  I guess this is where all those salary and compensation cuts went, huh?  The 2007/2008 ""financial crash"" excuse can't cover you too much longer - the company is selling more units and is more profitable than ever."
"10138","A lot of corros spend a long time adding anodyne and mundane background to someone else's story to get that ""additional reporting"" byline rather than break news or move the story on.

Once something is working for the sales reps finance pulls the plug and says were selling to many.  The revolving door atmosphere does not build confidence on a sales floor.  People mysteriously disappear, better hope you don't get... saddled with a bad territory. We have all seen good sales reps be at the top of the pack get their territory changed and get walked out for not making the number.  They could be seasoned reps with more than 5 years or reps with 6 months under their belt, if you cant make you 3 month rolling average see ya! Doesn't matter how hard you work or how many hoops your jump through.  Someone needs to fix this department!

On the other hand, not surprisingly, some old crustiness remains, and meanwhile some bad new ideas have made their way in as well. First off, you need to get each and every manager onto a more helpful, motivational... track. At the moment, some managers are very demotivational and very brittle regarding feedback. The boss gets the final say, but it shouldn't be career suicide to have a disagreement about how technology works. Also, managers should be seen as helpful to the employee; it's easily a one-way street for some at review-time. Second, work-life balance, better salaries or merit-based compensation, and more self-determinism at work will help you retain your better employees. And stop off-shoring!

I work onsite, use company supplies, and am required to work specified hours, yet I am considered an ""independent contractor."" The company misclassifies some of its workers, in violation of IRS guidelines, in order to save money on benefits. Per... the IRS, a true independant contractor has multiple clients, exercises control over how their work is performed, uses their own tools, and is not required to work set hours. Basically, an independent contractor is a plumber or electrician who has their own business, not a full-time office worker.

Not getting paid benefits is bad enough, yet the way I am treated at work is difficult not to take personally. I sit one row over from the team I work with, yet my boss goes months without stopping by to check in on me and the other ""independent contractor,"" and we are excluded from the periodic team events such as birthday celebrations and holiday parties. They celebrate birthdays one row over from us, yet we are required to sit at our desks and continue working while everyone else eats cake and socializes. On a Friday in December, all the other workers besides the two ""contractors"" left the office for an entire afternoon to go to a restaurant for the holiday party.

Yes, even during my 2nd year when (again) we posted RECORD revenues and our 2nd best profits. Raises? Nah.

Most poorly run large company... imaginable.  Whether they will ultimately implode is not the question, but when?  And how they have avoided it so far?? Not a place for a serious professional."
"10531","This is a tone at the top problem.  Won't be solved without a strategic initiative to re-evaluate the business as a whole through identifying individual business operational units key performance indicators, followed by organization wide cleansing of incompetent managers.  Define required key competencies for running business units, let go managers who lack them, and promote from within those who do.  Key... operstional competencies needed for each business unit are:  industry expertise, financial expertise, operational expertise, sales and marketing expertise.  

Stop the promotion of ""yes men"" and go with the most passionate customer oriented personnel you already have.  Stop believing the operational managers' reports on product and personnel capacity vis-a-vis client service delivery capacity and ask the line sales and customer service personnel, (because management where I worked misrepresented everything).  if you are losing business in a unit, and managment is still saying how great things are, then that's where your firing should start."

For instance; they discourage telecommuting, the core hours are 8-5, they seem to frown on wearing a t-shirt and jeans.  Not surprising given they roots as West Publishing.  As someone who has spent my career at various software companies though, I was surprised by... this and can see why good people move on eventually. 

For what its worth, TR is almost solely a web/server development shop and is tied to this model.  If you work on a non server based product it can be frustrating as they don't seem to realize that all bugs can't be addressed immediately by a hot fix to the website.

TR uses agile development to a point.  They use short development cycles (sprints) but that's about all of the agile method they have adopted.

I would also encourage them to invest more resources into training employees so that they are more recognized through relevant accreditation and feel more prepared for their work."
"10587","The pay is not as competitive as it needs to be and the recognition for individual achievements needs to improve.  There is no pay incentive based on and individuals performance. All pay increases are based on the business unit as a whole.  The career development and training is lacking focus."
"10588","If the business unit as a whole is not going to recognize individual performance appropriately, then then local management needs to be more active in doing so.  They also need to do a better job of encouraging career growth and managerial training of the high potential individuals."

The company has more bureaucracy than the government - getting something done that... should take someone 5 minutes can cost you hours.
Bonuses and recognition are not tied to individual performance, but to projects or departments you may happen to be assigned to. Group or team recognition is usually very political.
Promotions have been rare lately except at the top - lots of executives shuffling around and giving themselves loftier titles, but little occurring at the bottom."
"10592","If it were possible to accurately measure productivity drops in the past year that are related to working conditions, top performers leaving, and poor compensation, you would be shocked. But as usual you would likely not actually hold anyone accountable."
"10593","Upper Management made some steep cuts in personnel, not necessarily considering the effect it had on morale.  Many have voluntarily left since the massive layoffs."
"10594","High profile clients expect excellent service from people that they trust, and have worked with in the past.  They don't like when you interrupt the flow and their ability to perform at the highest level."
"10595","even though I was promoted I thought their practices and application of review is highly flawed and subjective.  no real middle management leadership and senior mangement is completely out of touch.  Some of their products do not work.  They throw out working systems and replace them with systems that dont work.  Good ideas, bad execution."

"10633","Each team at TR has one rockstar developer and the entire team rests on him/her to get the job done. If that developer is on leave, work just stalls. Lead Software engineers do not do  ANY coding and it gets frustrating when they start meddling with your code just for kicks.
People are demotivated in general. Not doing their work is not met with any action during the reviews. Employees just come in, talk on the... phone the whole day and spend hours on Facebook and twitter. Even worse, some softies check in buggy code and make life hell for the guys who actually do the work.
Management treats software engineers as replaceable entities and does not respect them enough - I personally knew a business lead who threw tantrums and treated a dev on my team like crap. Management in general does not seem to know what to do with all the useless projects lying around and decides the best thing to do is shift resources.
Review process is a joke. Managers take it very lightly. Micromanagement is not uncommon."
"10634","Please respect your engineers. Without them, you will just be a bunch of lawyers. Try to get a hang of industry standards when you pay your engineers. There is a 20-30k difference between the industry average and what you guys pay. Hiding behind the recession and dumping the load on the Bangalore teams does not necessarily fit with your mission that the ""Business is global"". If you claim to be a technology company,... then act like one."
"10635","It's getting comical how under market people are being paid for my position.
The review and promotion structure is bureaucratic through and through.  More non-management people are realizing that there are team quotas stopping them from getting proper reviews.
Reshuffling people is now a normal activity, stilting any chances for advancement because you are under new management ever 9 months.
Employees are... absolutely just a number to the company.  Nothing more."
"10636","Either your strategy is to speed the attrition of talent from TR (in which case you are winning!) or we are too big and have too much management to the point where we can't move fast enough to deal with the problems if we wanted to."
"10637","Extremely ineffective first level mgmt, with no authority to make decisions.  No raises for the past couple of years (at least for me), no reason other than I make more than my band says I should even though I'm consistently rated high.

When they off-shore groups and help desks, they just expect you to join calls at all hours and work globally."
"10638","Pay more attention to your employees.  Everywhere I look, morale is at an all-time low.  TR wants their margins up and layoffs immediately follow.  That coupled with 0% raises for the past couple of years makes it hard to want to stay here.  As I said above, if I lose any of the freedom I currently have, it would make it impossible for me to justify staying."
"10639","Nepotism. Nepotism. Nepotism. 
Poor strategic execution."
"10640","Thomson Reuters used to be a great company. It has lost its way. It has grown arrogant and no longer seems to care what its customers are saying. Middle and senior management has got very creative at brushing aside customers complains and only report the good scripted feedback."
"10641","Despite feel-good corporate pabulum, talent is treated with condescension and contempt: actions speak louder than words, and doublespeak is the order of the day. The organization is ridden by vicious politics, and mgmt at the highest levels appear indecisive, rudderless, and as others have noted, contradictory. Firing people with deep knowledge and invaluable experience and hiring ever more bargain-basement... incompetents from Eastern Europe and elsewhere will not result in quality software products."
"10642","Stop your revoltingly feckless and faux-cheery game of musical chairs job-swapping while meanwhile firing the people who do the actual work; thin your own bloated ranks, make well-considered decisions about products, and then see them through to completion. In a word: lead. Because right now...you're not."
"10643","No chance for upward growth in some departments and also pay hikes are very minimal and generalized with all employees."
"10644","Create more chances for upward mobility where possible and be more transparent with the review process to identify what is necessary for the employees to focus on."
"10645","- lack of sustained vision -> strategy from leadership

"10649","1) Any shift work from 6:00am - 10:00pm 
2) The demand on the frontline employees is completely inconsistent with the quality of the backend people and infrastructure.  Customers must rate you ""Very Good"" to get bonus.  A rating of ""Good"" means failure.   
3) Do not courage work hard and productivity.  The more case you have, the more chance you rated badly by the customers
4) People who kissed boss's ass are... promoted to the team leader and senior management
5) Process and policy are the jokes.  All team leaders and managment can do whatever they want to even it is againist the process and policy. In fact, they do not really know they existed.
6) The more the customers, the less headcount you get. (Vice versa is also true)
7) Too much below average employees.  The managment is only intersted in hiring low quality people because they are cheaper.  Quantity is ,much more important than the quality.
8) There is no accountability. People are never responsible for  the mistake they make."
"10650","Stop telling people ""Customers are the heart"" while acting ""profit always comes first"".
Accountability only existed in the frontline staff.

"10657","Running out of opportunities to grow
Derisory pay rise if you aren't a favoured employee

Very London centric"
"10658","I get the feeling the people that aren't at the top are starting to get itchy feet. I've noticed a few people whispering in to their phones discreetly recently."
"10659","Some projects and groups in the company which handle the core revenue-producing products/services aren't treated or valued as highly as they should be.  Particularly in comparison to new R&D which seems to get the majority of the focus, spotlight and investment."
"10660","Keep running the company responsibly as you have, but be sure to look at and invest in employees/groups at all levels of the company as equal...in terms of growing and preparing for the future."
"10661","Tend to treat software engineers as replaceable units or COGs.  One is as good as the next and we can just swap in resource x for resource y.  They do not value the opinions of their employees unless they closely match the management line."
"10662","Listen to your employees.  They have great ideas...  Honestly it seems like upper management wants to listen, but middle and lower management are still afraid to make waves, so you end up with upper management asking for honest feedback, but all feedback being filtered through a layer that is afraid to say anything revolutionary."
"10663","The companies TR acquire can be small and not of a corporate mindset (good old boy networks/ clicks), and senior mangement is too far away to pick up on it to correct it. Pay is very below industry standard and teh hours are long."
"10664","Reuters used to be a place any journalist would be proud of working for. But in the years since the Thomson takeover it has become anything but. Journalists provide much of the content that distinguishes the Reuters terminal from other financial data/trading platforms such as Bloomberg but this is not recognised salary wise. Below inflation annual salary increases (0.7% in 2011) and no profit-sharing schemes for... journalists. We are losing journalists to rivals and failing to attract and retain news talent due to uncompetitive salaries."
"10665","Put news at the core of your terminals because frankly the financial markets users prefer the other brand for trading/data platform functionality. They retain Reuters terminals because they prefer the news. If you want Editorial to share in company's vision and be motivated then it's time we have a share in profits. Link our salaries to terminals sold like Bloomberg. Cut down on the layers of middle managers in the... newsroom. Most of your journalists are experienced hands so we don't need 3 layers of editors who don't write but all want input into ongoing stories and spend inordinate amounts of time on internal emails that we laugh at anyway. Reporters often don't make good managers so get these overpaid and often incompetent managers back to breaking stories."
"10666","In spite of consistent  annual increases in revenue, staff receiving 1% or less annual increases for high-performers and promotions is now the norm. Thomson Reuters focuses instead on  acquiring divisions and squeezing them dry. Healthcare is extremely top-heavy with VPs and SVPs and the number increases almost daily.  Management can be very inflexible. Outsiders and new ideas are not received well and frequently... perceived as a threat. Staff is consistenly overworked, underappreciated and at a constant frantic-like state. Employees are frequently angry and frustrated, but unwilling to speak up. What's more unfortunate is that HR and management have the attitude that (in light of the economy) ""staff should be grateful to have a job and go elsewhere if they don't like it here"".  I quote that, because it has been said many times. I know of no-one lower than 'Director' in rank that is truly happy working here though most will smile and say it's 'ok'. Healthcare is burning through a lot of good, hard-working people. I am honestly concerned for the health and future of many of us."
"10667","Advice at its most basic level is to engage all HR and management in training and readings in employee relations from the human perspective rather than legal or business angles.  It appears that basic, obvious, common sense principles of human behavior need to be refreshed. Suggested reading to include: Motivation Management, Good to Great, and The Power of Their Ideas (this one may be a stretch for some to... correlate the information to the business office)."
"10668","A lot of information you can explore when you get your foot in the door of fiancial market. Many training program."

"10671","If it isn't broken, why are you trying to fix it?  In 2011, upper management's attempts to ""fix"" what wasn't broken has resulted in the worst performance for Q1 ever."

"10685","minimum raise. bad review process"
"10686","Post-merger politics means processes, decisions and positions are not based on what is best, but more where management hails from.  The company is mired in bureaucracy and lacks competitive focus.  Moving positions off-shore has not been a universally successful strategy."
"10687","The product development process must be streamlined in practice, not just in name.  Decisions take too long to make and employees feel they aren't involved in the decision-making.  New products suffer from over-engineering and oppressive process overhead while current products are left to stagnate."
"10688","Any work-life balance only exists if you hit your quota.

"10691","None."
"10692","Reorganizes very frequently and sometimes reverses decisions made only a few years before. Good employees and managers are leaving to look for more stability and career progression.  Pay is generally good but merit increases have been minimal or non-existent for the past three years. Lots of rumors about further consolidation. Once the economy improves, they must reward employees who stayed the course or they will... leave. Also, much concern over outsourcing labor to India. Jobs are disappearing right and left as our Indian workforce continues to grow."
"10693","Communicate decisions more quickly. If you're going to merge, divest, or invest, let employees know as soon as possible. In a vacuum, employees fear the worst and become unfocused. Employees like the company but don't want to always be worrying whether their job is safe."
"10694","Not much work pressure which in a way is not good if this is your first job.

"10722","Divest the Healthcare Division. TR corporate leadership doesn't really understand that business and should stick to its knitting with the financial and legal businesses. The healthcare market is highly fragmented and evolving quickly to just a few diversified players. Winning means betting big or going home. TR's healthcare business should be owned by a parent in that industry -- TR can't duplicate the formula it... has used in financial and legal -- expensive platforms built once with pricey access to mission critical information sold over and over to large numbers of deep pocketed users -- in healthcare. In the financial and legal markets, the company adds considerable value to publicly available information. In healthcare, the information is owned by patients and protected by privacy laws. Moreover, the professionals -- doctors and nurses -- have natural access to the information. TR needs another formula for success in healthcare, but hasn't shown any willingness or ability to understand or invest in the market to find it. Given the impact of reform and massive consolidation within the industry, TR's healthcare assets would be better exploited by another -- preferably healthcare-focused parent."

These drawbacks of the company tend to increase with your seniority. In a senior sales position the majority of your time negotiating a deal will be making sense of internal pricelists, CRM... systems and trying to understand competing fractions of the company. Many sales experts/product owners are actually more interested in meeting with the customers and just talking rather than selling."
"10726","Employees enjoy freedom, so letting them own their own career is probably a wise choice. However, without clear direction, people start behaving like children and turf-wars and sub-optimising are now common. 

People in expert roles need to be experts and not just learn from the customers so invest in people by actually employing people with experiance. Buying a company and the see all the top experts from that... company leave is unacceptable and people negotiating such a deal or managing such an integration should be dealt with accordingly."
"10727","Lack of career progression opportunities"
"10728","Pay is on the lower end of the scale, and promotions are hard to come by and can be as much about luck as skill.  Annual bonuses are a given and do not reflect your performance.  Performance-based bonuses are so random as to actually be cruel.  Re-organizations are very common, meaning all the time you spent showing your boss how hard you work and what you get done may mean little weeks later when a new manager... controls your salary increase. The massive size of the company means it is very bureaucrat and clever and original ideas often go no where or take so long to implement that they are no longer effective."
"10729","The compensation system stinks, and needs to be reworked.  Make it more transparent.  The annual bonus to different business groups does not reflect any one person's actual performance.  A high performer in a team of high performers can end up with poor raises due to the way the raises work, and as managers have an average raise quota it often means team members have an incentive to sabotage each other to get the... bigger raise.

There are a few people in power positions here who are rude, nasty tyrants. The ones who get promoted are the ones who are ""BFF's"" with the higher ups. So those who work hard and rightfully deserve a promotion will never get one. There is a ton of favoritism in this... company. The raises are minuscule. Different supervisors often make completely different rules to follow under the very same manager, leading to employees feeling very mistreated. There is no flexibility in your schedule at any time during the week before the 20th of each month if you work in Client Services. The company is set back in the olden days and only allows telecommuting in very rare circumstance. Employees are often treated like children. Micromanagement runs rampant across the entire company. The office environment is horrible. I have seen/heard more verbal (almost physical) FIGHTS between employees/supervisors/managers than I could ever possibly imagine. The software we use is archaic. The office furniture is brutally uncomfortable. The town hall meetings are a huge waste of time. Management is actually tasked with looking around and writing down employee's names who fall asleep during the meeting. Office activities are canceled due to lack of participation. The company does nothing for devastating floods that hit the Atlanta area (including employees' homes) in 2009, but will collect money to donate to other countries for their disasters. Thomson Reuters has laid off many employees and sent their jobs overseas. More and more jobs are being sent over there every day. But then the work comes back to us for us to fix all the mistakes they make while management blames us as the reason for the mistake. Just about all employees fear for the loss of their job. I do not recommend Thomson Reuters as a place to work unless you really need the money and are faced with living on the streets."

The talented people in those companies leave once their employment contracts are over. They take brains and energy with them. They are usually pretty miserable by then. 

The tech platforms are a mess,... integration is a mess, and clients only use their stuff because they are monopolies for certain kinds of historic data which is too costly and time consuming now to recreate. They are not delivering the cutting edge, and for big players they are cheaper than Bloomberg that's why they're there for 10,000s of lower level financial personnel. 

It will always be difficult for them with this cash cow portfolio strategy. On the sellside, they will bounce around competing with Bloomberg in good times and and taking real hits in bad. They will always be the lower cost alternative for large client sites who are demanding and penny pinching. Even on the sellside, quality of support to brokers and advisors is becoming a joke as there are so many on the streets. Now they own Reuters too to ease whatever competition there was. For the buyside, they need the historical data which is now a commodity, but they have a strong link there. The buyside add their own proprietary value with their models, so only need data, no analytics of any note. 

Meanwhile, the industry suffers from lack of competition and lack of technology innovation which can deliver this data at much lower costs than with the BBG, Thomson/Reuters paradigm still firmly in place and still held together by COBOL and FORTRAN.

Not sure with cash cow strategy they need or want... personal initiative, except insofar as to be a hero against all internal obstacles on every project. They seem to like and promote tyrants.

I quite frequently feel expendable, especially with the waves of India replacements.  Buy... America - are you kidding?  These guys are told to buy India support, and people and groups are being slashed all the time to make way for the new Thomson-India-IT (goole and you'll see the numbers).  This meeting obsession has got to be higher here than any other environment I’ve work for in the past, the meeting thing here is so irritating I couldn't put my diatribes on a 5 GB DVD much less put it in this little blurb.

Still, there are lots of nice people here, you just have to weed through the management lot, they’re the anomaly.  Top down way of thinking, input is rarely received, I almost feel they tolerate what you have to say, and rather you not speak at all.

Clients are getting frustrated because of all of the different associates on their accounts.  Clients are passed around like... playing cards. There is no room for growth within this company.  Little to no career direction or career planning.  There is no upward mobility for associates just lateral moves like a game of musical chairs.  There is no formal training for new associates, they are hired and then bombarded with work and then chastised when mistakes are made.  This is a company for you if you like being stagnate and being complacent in your day to day job.  There is no job enrichment, job enlargment or job rotation.  Performance reviews are thrown at you as the golden ticket, but you arent rewarded if you do a good job so whats the point.  Our little to nonexistent pay raises are 3%, and thats on a good year.  Jobs are constantly being outsourced to third world countries when our economy is in the worst shape ever.  Way to go Thomson Reuters, way to add to the national unemployment rate.  There are townhall meetings about the greatness of the company and how well the company is performing, yet in still no pay raises this year and entire departments were shipped to India.  Not to beat up on the people of India, but we correct more mistakes due to them than any other source.  You get what you pay for.

As far as I can tell, there's no way to advance my career without moving into management. It's possible that career opportunities exist, but none of my managers have time to... discuss it with me. 

I attend a lot of conferences (during non-work hours) where I learn about better ways to do my job, but I'm not allowed time to try these ideas out, and when I suggest them to my manager, I receive no response. 

I know more than one person who has left the company for reasons like these, and hiring managers seem completely unfazed by it. Instead of trying to fix the problem, they just open up a new req, which I suppose just means that they don't consider it to be a problem.

Communication is lacking. The weird part about this, is that it seems like senior management has heard this message over the past few years, and instead of fixing it by understanding what sort of communication is lacking, has instead ""fixed"" the problem by producing more of what I'd call internal spam--telling us about volunteer work someone has done in some office in some other country and such. That's not the communication I'm looking for. Instead, I want to hear about things like what's going on in the business unit I work for. What are our financial targets? Are they realistic? Are we on track to meet them? If not, what are we going to do to fix that? (And I don't want to just hear the marketing hype, I want to hear what we're _really_ going to do.)

"11216","Although Thomson is always looking for new opportunities to expand, it will also divest itself of divisions often - that is why job security at Thomson is a problem."
"11217","The company has an internal job board which is important, but the company needs to allow employees to transfer to other positions more often."
"11218","Lack of communication at times due to sheer size of the corporation. Also due to corporation size, a lot of bureaucracy involved when trying to procure materials/tools to complete tasks properly."
"11219","Continue to work on corporate communication. Strive to provide better guidance to employees on how their roles impact the organization as a whole."

"11229","Spread your wealth!"
"11230","There is no growth and no path to grow. I took this job thinking that based on the size and prestige of the company that with my talent and experience, I could grow in no time.  Not only has that not happened, I've found myself in an atmosphere where the idea of growth seems disdainful. Additionally there is very little recognition for a job well done or spirit of team work."
"11231","Good ideas come from people who aren't managers all the time. Recognize them when they dont.  Allow a greater voice to low level employees - they are closest to your customers."
"11232","Management is not communicating the changes that are happening because of outsourcing. They let the employees get paranoid and stew instead of being honest. But management expects us to be honest about how we feel! Thomson has really changed in the year and a half since it merged with Reuters. Not for the better. It feels like the""global company"" is leaving Eagan behind. Only attorneys and FindLaw feel secure. It's... the kind of place where management brag about how their profits are good, then freeze bonuses and lay people off."
"11233","Some of your departments are in BIG trouble, with morale. You'd better start opening up to employees about the future. Listen to their complaints and frustrations. Quality is already declining because the outsourcers aren't proactive like Eagan people who know the work for decades."
"11234","Sales catalog is large and covers many topical areas.  You have to be really organized to be successful.   Market is saturated, but company still wants to make profits it made 10 years ago before the recession. Big staff turnover which hurts reputation with clients.  Customer Service has gone way down because company keeps sending clients to ""support"" in MN where reps keep changing.  Not the company that clients... remember from years ago."

"11240","No room for growth.  You will do the same job for the next five years without a promotion or any recognition."

"11242","big, too big; can get very bureaucratic; probably pay less than the industry standard; sometimes, developers can get the shaft with office space and other things like that."
"11243","HR policy needs to be better organized; streamline the bureaucracy; discourage large and pointless meetings; a little less development process - the process is so heavy now that development has slowed to a crawl."
"11244","The downsides of working at Thomson Reuters include having to be billable and making sure to meet the goals of billable hours"
"11245","I would offer management to give employees more vacation time and not to less billable hours required for the employees"

"11250","The pay was well below market rate, and the organizational structure was very flat, with very little room for advancement."
"11251","To get better quality employees (and keep them), pay a reasonable wage. Hiring in at low pay levels brings in younger employees willing to work for almost nothing, but when they find there is no room for advancement, they look for better paying opportunities."

"11263","Think globally but also locally to ensure or USPs are not lost."
"11264","Offshoring (aka SELLING OUT).  I agree with another poster that TR has changed over the past ten years.  TR has a short-term vision of earning profits for shareholders rather than a long-term vision of satisfying customers, growing the organization and becoming a responsible, American organization.  TR is on the forefront of selling Americans soul for the benefit of the few and the demise of the many.  It's... interesting in how TR claims to be on the front lines of charity and helping others but yet their policies and hiring practices contribute to the weakness of our economy.  As a long time employee, I’m embarrassed to work for Thomson as corporate responsibility has gone out the window.  Yes, we are now in a global economy but that does not mean we sell our country and our people out.  It's a shame.

Last (a sad note), many very strong and talented people were laid off recently from TR.  No reason was given but based on geography; it was prejudicial and done so to maximize executive profits."
"11265","Remove the tunnel vision and focus on the overall, long-term health of your organization and Country.

"11274","To get promoted you have to jump through hoops and a lot of times people who absolutely don't deserve it end up getting the position. Not a lot of career growth"
"11275","Leadership in Thomson Reuters is pretty much the same as in any other corporate world.  However, the pay is a little below what other companies are paying out."
"11276","The compensations is not great if you have spent 10 years in the company even if your career has progress well in terms of responsibilities and promotions and you are a constant achiever in the top 10% in end of the year performance reviews. The disappointing thing about Thomson Reuters is that you often end up having to accomodate a lot of people that don't really do anything useful apart from add bureaucracy for... the sake of looking like they are involved and doing something."
"11277","Get rid of the bureaucracy and start recognizing the people that are talented and do good work, but are often buried under 4-5 layers political playing incompetence above them - the company would work so much better on a meritocracy rather than political playing internal navigators. As a whole it is a great company to work for and truly has some great assets and fun things to work on, so we could attracts so much... better talent."

"11281","As with most companies, some managers are inexperienced and biased.  In our division TR needs to better educate middle-managment, particularly on sensitive HR issues."
"11282","There is a strong push to move technical and editorial jobs overseas.  The company does not ""shoot-straight"" with its employees.  Instead they create euphemisms for off-shoring work (BPI) and keep employees at bay by emphasizing that we are a global company (READ: don't complain, we can find 10 people in india to do your job for you). Layoffs happen by having people ""disappear"" a few handfuls at a time with no open... or honest discussion about the criteria.  They claim their death-march projects are ""agile"" but then force agile team members to work overtime."
"11283","Be honest with your employees.  Treat them with respect and dignity, and expect them to be professionals in return. When you need to let people go (layoffs or firings) be sure everyone knows the criteria that was used to determine who should go (otherwise how do those of us left know we won't be next?)"

"11293","Value your employees more."
"11294","Dont go here if your looking for a career, unless of course you aspire to work in India for a fraction of the pay.  Many jobs already moved to India and many more will be moving in the next few months.  Great way to support the American workfoce!"
"11295","Stop outsourcing to India and bring back all the lost American jobs!  Cheaper is not always better, just cheaper.  How about eliminating all the senior management big bonus programs, that would save a tone of cash!"
"11296","You're stuck in a division. Not much opportunity to change roles without taking on risk to your career. No real career path definition, or assistance in helping you in that area. I've noticed that almost every senior manager...well looks like a senior manager. Tall, attractive, corporate looking."
"11297","The corporate structure obviously drives efficiencies. However, the amount of reorgs has been to much recently. This is no doubt due to economic challenges, but its kind of a buzz saw. Makes lower level employees uneasy."
"11298","Depending on the department you're in work can range from fast-paced and exciting to catotonic.  Still large business lacking a vitality often found in smaller businesses."
"11299","Less hierarchical structure.  Pay structure limiting ALL business units and department to the same flat percentage increase makes no sense at all... other than to take the politics and headache out of more flexible structure."

Fight the fight for your employees.  One big problem is that middle management seems to just take what upper level management gives and just hands it right on down."
"11320","In response to revenue declines, senior management has adopted a slash-and-burn strategy of U.S staff (and their generally higher salaries vis-a-vis India) to keep Wall St. analysts happy with the overall profit picture. First it was technology and other back-office functions being moved to India, and now the actual production of content is going there as well. This is all cloaked in the guise of ""diversity"" and... ""globalization"" but it's funny how Caucasian and male the upper ranks of management remain. Apparently diversity is not important at the top levels of the company. Let's face it, it's all about cutting U.S. staff in favor of cheaper labor elsewhere."
"11321","Good luck with customer satisfaction as an increasing amount of legal publishing content is compiled by Chinese vendors and Indian editorial staff. Last I heard, fluency in the English language is not a strong point in either location. Also, try to come up with some strategies to sell more product to boost revenue rather than simply implement 10-20% price increases every year."
"11322","They lay off people in good times and bad. They get rid of talented long-time veterans and replace them with cheap, inexperienced labor in Ireland or India. They talk about the quality of their data, and it used to be true. But for a while it's been all talk. They cut departments to the point where people can't do their jobs well, are just trying to survive and will never be able to catch up, much less do something... innovative or different. Politics determine promotions, certainly not competence. I've seen many prosper because of who they know. Certainly not because of what they know."

"11324","If you decide to work for this company and you live in the United States, you can be guaranteed you will loose your job to someone in India. After moving job after job to India, the company had the audacity ask the employees to donate funds to the people in India that suffered some kind of loss due to a recent flood. These donations were begged of employees who were notified their jobs would be terminated soon.... 

This company has become so narrowminded and blindsighted that they can't see or hear their own employees' hatred towards them, even though it's clearly expressed in almost every single action they take.  They have repeatedly assured everyone that ""we will all be taken care of"", only to continue to lay off people and send their jobs to India. 

Do not trust this company."
"11325","My advice to management is to start updating your resumes. You've effectively eliminated all the positions in the United States and sent them to India already - what makes you think you're safe?"

Be careful if you end up on the wrong side or disagree you will either have a short career or a painful one. 

Sales floor has become... more metics driven than sales driven?  Do sales really result in all of the litle spread sheets du jur? Talk time etc or should you allow experienced sales reps to actually have some autonomy?  Probably not. 

If you end up on the Perfomance Improvement Plan, you better get your resume done and start seeing a head hunter right away.  Unfortunatly all you need is one bad month or the wrong manager and you might just be there."
"11331","Direct managers could use some basic managment/people skills training.  But if you want to manage through fear and gossip - great go for it.  Managers should stop being so happy that turn over is down.  Most reps won't leave because of the economy, and no ""just be happy you have a job"" does not equate job satisfaction.

No individual job security. Thomson will... prevail, but most likely outside of the US Market within a decade."
"11335","Your Kool-aid is toxic. I see ""koolaid"" referenced in other posts so this must be a Thomson advocated word to justify immoral, although not illegal, actions. If you want longevity as a corporation, then provide an environment where employees do not have to live in fear of losing their jobs. If you want loyalty, then be loyal to your employees.

There is NO ONE internal system to handle the business --billing, AP, AR, entitlements, contracts etc.   There are approximately  15 different internal systems.  There is no interface to combine and streamline a cohesive view of the client--like the ability to... view all products one firm has with ThomsonReuters--when the contracts ends, what the pricing is, products on an invoice that no one at Thomson Rueters knows what it is because it was sunsetted years ago.  Horrible.  Most clients are irate with that aspect of ThomsonReuters and take it out on the account management/salespeople."
"11365","None"
"11366","Sales is valued more than competence and customer service"
"11367","Remain true to West's values, recognize value in the legal education of employees"
"11368","If you are in any IT support group are in denial if you don't know that you are being way way way underpaid....look your job up at a salary site and you will throw up.  Go where you can earn enough for food and shelter."
"11369","Check your pay scale.  You are not fairly compensating the backbone of your product support.   And it is their work that keeps your clients happy and your new cars coming."
"11370","The corporate culture can be annoying at time.  People certainly play politics a lot of the time.  It is tangible."
"11371","Make sure that communication remains transparent and consistent throughout the company.  The merger was handled well during my time at the company."
"11372","Salary is below market rates in my field of work. It is easy to get stuck doing the same job for many years, there is no good career path. Difficult to move into other fields. You will have plenty of opportunity to move and rotate if you are working in the product group, otherwise you are pretty much stuck doing what you always do."
"11373","Dare to take risks and rotate staff into other roles. You will be up for a very positive surprise!"
"11374","Not much impotence for technology people, employee referral program is not efficient"
"11375","Keep up the good work"
"11376","Some of the pros of working at TF can also become a con.  For example, the trade off of all the different acquisitions at TF is that there's no real corporate culture since everyone came from a different company.  I also sense a lot of fear of sharing knowledge since people were afraid to divulge their ""secret sauce"" fearing that it make them obsolete and expendable.  There isn't a lot of inter departmental teamwork... and many things are fragmented.  You can work on the same floor with another guy and never know what he works on, what product he builds/supports, or which department he works for.  

There's also a lot of turmoil at the leadership level all the time.  There's no real sense of who's running the show at the top."
"11377","Need to create a sense of corporate culture that spans all the different acquisition and somehow force more teamwork and cooperation.  Need to be more aggressive at cutting out obsolete personnel or products while creating more routes for innovation."
"11378","No professional growth or opportunity for advancement, average pay, and incompetent management, especially those in the small law firm segment. The new pay structure does not encourage over achievement. With a larger base salary and smaller commissions, sales reps are not motivated to do much more than necessary."
"11379","Try to reduce the politics and hire better trained leaders, who have been formally educated in management, to lead the small law firm segment."
"11380","Old boys club, 95% withe arrogant males, tons of politics, mediocre managment"
"11381","Fire all middle management or everyone that has been there for over 15 years and they are a lot of those.,"
"11382","Hard to get past being a face in the crowd and not easy to show off your talents or work on new projects.  Office environment is exclusive and somewhat hostile.  Management is often incompetent.  Promotions are rare."
"11383","Better training for management below senior exec level and hire managers with experience, many managers were promoted right out of entry-level positions because they play office politics well, but are incompetent managers"
"11384","None that I could see."
"11385","I'd say..please keep the company in good standing all times. I greatly appreciate the way our senior management is taking it forward"
"11386","Compensation could be better.  Large divides without logic in terms of compensation.  Can be highly political at management level, though probably no worse than other similar organisations.  Currently facing a big culture clash following the Thomson - Reuters merger."
"11387","harmonise pay for similar job roles.  Offer a clear path for advancement."
"11388","Its a very big...over 50,000 staff. Just one year has passed since Thomson acquired Reuters but more synergy is needed."
"11389","Support your teams, they are there fore you."
"11390","Big company, leadership tends to play favorites. It can be difficult to move into other roles given the size.  Salaries are not equal across comparable roles.  The tech organization pays much better than the business units for the same role."
"11391","Value all employees and listen to feedback even if it is not in alignment with your thoughts.  Be careful not to have one membership of your leadership team ""label"" someone and inhibit their career growth."
"11392","There are not a lot of career advancement opportunities. Employees in reference attorneys department were not treated like professionals. When reference attorneys were part of customer experience, it was much better but when they put reference attorneys with sales and account management, the push for sales rather than providing research made the culture no longer a good place to work."
"11393","Move reference attorneys back to customer experience with customer service."
"11394","No Security - Company sells businesses and lays off often"
"11395","profits are important, but you can have profits and still offer more job security to your employees"
"11396","The reality of career advancement is moving into a management position, and never ending meetings.  Human Resources can be frosty sometimes.  Low turnover means you wait longer for promotions, but this is only a downside if you are looking to move up.  Otherwise, not ecstatic but mostly happy employees."
"11397","Less meetings, but then Senior Management would be first to agree here.  They can be necessary at management level.  Opportunities for lateral and upwards movement could be better.  Corporate level communications could be clearer, but has any company perfected communication?  Thank you for seeing that we're not simply a corporate entity but a group of human beings and in the end more important than short term stock... performance."
"11398","Very large company (40,000+) can sometimes make individual employees feel like just one of the masses"
"11399","Stop the emails! Communicate with employees in other interactive ways so each employee feels the connection to organizational goals."
"11400","I found that the work itself was quite mundane and not challenging or fulfilling. I had a degree in finance and business management when I joined this company out of college. Looking back I realized that it was probably a poor choice because my daily job duites turned out to be completely irrelevant from my education in finance, and I was really no more than a glorified data entry person."
"11401","I would recommend that management consider ways to make data entry jobs more challenging and appealing to people who have a strong finance background and want to advance their career in a manner relevant to their skill sets."
"11402","Thomson tends to have thick layers of management. The top and the bottom do not interact. Very clubby. If you are senior management you will appreciate the front line gatekeeper managers. The company is top heavy and invests heavily in its senior management. This is not a very democratic company. On the face of it, to employees, the company presents a culture of inclusion but I found it to be  very one sided. Talent... does not necessarily serve you well here but being political and building the correct allegiances will be very beneficial."
"11403","I thought most of the senior management were smart and loyal, a joy to interact with. I'm not sure about knowledge sharing."
"11404","large company; many long time employees whom are NOT open to new ideas or processes"
"11405","Look under the hood! you are losing many good people and will be stuck with some GREAT suck-ups! Some of your ""middle management"" employees treat people (whom they believe) beneath them in an abrasive and abusive manner... absolutely unacceptable in ANY organization."
"11406","Not the best paid companies around."
"11407","Listen to the team's concerns and try to address it rather than forgetting it.  Give team more appreciation other than a mere good job pat."
"11408","Draconian management. The management can only be described as incompetent. Because Rockville is not their headquarters, they are mainly focused on giving a good appearance to those in New York. Their incompetence creates problems and then they brag to NY about how they made everyone come in over the weekend to fix a problem they created. The staff turnover is very high and the impression I had was this was a good... thing. The philosophy was to treat employees badly, or treat employees badly in the hopes they'll quit to save on severance. They try to create an atmosphere of you had better not slack off or else. What ends up happening is the good employees quit and the bad employees live in fear of being fired. On top of it all, they're trying to move as much as possible to India."
"11409","The management of Rockville is awful. It should be obvious to those in senior management and yet nothing is ever done."
"11410","The work life balance is somewhat lopsided though you are presented with the choice. Also, some individuals who put up walls and do not work as team members are a hinderance to the overall success of projects and the organization."
"11411","Remove those indivdiuals who work against progress and who put up walls between locations. Usually, these are individuals opposed ot change. These individuals are poisen to the culture and the success of the organization."
"11412","As part of a large corporation (its even larger know with the merger of Thomson and Reuters),  there are the typical beuracracies and negatives that come with a company of this size.  One of the good things though is that Micromedex is a smaller, almost stand alone, part of the parent.  So this is less of a negative.   The finance group was small, so was little opportunity to advance your career."
"11413","Senior mgmt at Micromedex is competent and fairly attuned to their employees.  The problem is that they have to listen to what is handed down from on high, at Thomson corporate.  That creates a disconnect.  So I could go and talk to the CFO of Micromedex at any time and voice my opinion.  But it would never get to the CFO of Thomson."
"11414","It is so big you get a little lost getting things done"
"11415","Hang with the people as much as you can, do not make decisions without thinking of the customers,"
"11416","In my industry (legal) there is little opportunity to transfer to another city. But that's because people love their jobs and stay forever."
"11417","Believe in us!! We want to do a good job!"
"11418","Not enough promotion of people with a product (and technical) focus.  Lack of aggressive technology adoption, market expansion, which is frustrating in the iPhone world."
"11419","Start understanding how the information ecosphere is changing.  Start building out infrastructure to facilitate global expansion and sharing across businesses."
"11420","Slow moving culture and at times very political.  Eagan MN location has tremendous resources but is very hard to accomplish anything due to MN culture.  Compensation is fair, however superstar performers are not capable of driving for higher compensation."
"11421","Move more quicklyto  enable pan Thomson oppty's.   Be more entreprenurial.  Condier remote locations for senior executives."
"11422","They are over-reacting to the recession and therefore undervaluing and taking advantage of their employees."
"11423","Take a few management courses... you shouldn't promise things you can't deliver... even if they are ""unofficial."""
"11424","Promotion is cliquey - friends of managers get the jobs - and not based on merit or performance in current job.  Recent cull - with no transparency or visible process on decisions on selection of managers - folowing acquisition and integration of Reuters,. Need for quality on operations and project deliverables is satisfied by rigourous but frustrating processes."
"11425","Get some transparency and consistency in selection for posts, promotion etc.  Not enough process here while everyting else is stuck in process"
"11426","The company has a very slow pace, as it is too big to move fast."
"11427","TR senior management should show their appreciation to staff recognition in development center."
"11428","There's no onsite cafeteria at the Ann Arbor office but plenty of places to get drinks and food. Overtime is expected but that's the same in every exempt, salaried position. Deadlines could be tough but you do not need to stay in the office to do work. Due to the integration of many healthcare units, there is alot of bureaucracy that becomes apparent once people hit the director level and onwards."
"11429","Communicate more to lower level employees to engage them and help them adapt to the ongoing integration of the company as a whole. Be demanding but also fair to each member of the team since everybody has different abilities and skillsets they can bring to the table."
"11430","Bureaucracy and red tape amongst departments, micro-management, mid-level managers who lack management training, focus on cost-cutting techniques instead of growth from within, overlapping job functions, technologically challenged at times which can be disappointing, nepotism"
"11431","The best asset is it's people.  Embrace original thoughts and ideas.  Equally recognize the value of a loyal longterm employees over the shortterm urgency of contractors.  Please pay attention to employee morale and institute a true promotion process to reward the employee otherwise any review process is ineffective."
"11432","To grow to upper level no roadmap or inputs from Team management."
"11433","Get feedback from Team members and take appropriate action or provide the neccessary inputs to meet the concerns."
"11434","Because each division is allowed to function in its own way, there is no corporate oversight of whether a division is operating in the best interest of the company and its employees."
"11435","Senior management should consider requiring more training for middle management.  Too many managers do not have the appropriate skills.  Also, managers need to be taught how to delegate so that they are not trying to control too many individual issues at one time."
"11436","Thomson Reuters functions as a monarchy.  I firmly believe that all firms provide opportunity and your career is what you make of it.  But, Thomson Reuters makes it very difficult to generate any kind of career path.  It's definitely a tough place to work and feel good about it unless you enter the company as a senior manager or are someone with minimal ambition."
"11437","Tom Glocer is a good man.  He just hasnt put the right people under him.  He needs to take a closer look at his direct reports and make some tough decisions."
"11438","Management has no clue what they are doing, and do not welcome change that could spur growth for the company.  I worked long hours, but most work regular hours.  Not much training (thrown into the fire) and poor communication from higher ups.  I was really disappointed in the direction of the company as it is very old school styled."
"11439","Listen to your employees and give new project ideas a chance."
"11440","Too large of a company. Some people do get overlooked. Working for a public company has its drawbacks as sometimes the company is more focused on its shareholders rather than its employees."
"11441","Always keep your employees in mind. Your employees are those that help the company grow. reward those that should be rewarded."
"11442","Usual cons for global company such as organization and project management issues between teams separated by thousands of miles."
"11443","Finance isn't everything ! Reuters and Thomson Reuters is a great brand, that could expand its activities - information in the broad sense - to other domains."
"11444","Large company with lots of layers. I am one removed from a VP, but very far from the CEO. It could take a long time to climb this corporate ladder and I suspect that if you don't have an MBA from a top ten business school, you probably not possible."
"11445","More integration, lets make it easier for clients to buy from us."
"11446","Absolutely everything is analyzed and reviewed.  There is nothing that isn't measured or critiqued.  This becomes difficult at times.  Often, many in management seem to only have positions to manage others...positions are there only to manage other positions.  Often, many are seem wondering around. Often we have no idea what they really do.  The overlap in management is very high and needs to be reduced."
"11447","We would advise not to move support to the Phillipeans.  The end users do not want it.  The people in the purchasing departments of firms may think it is good, but I doubt anyone has actually talked to the end users of the products"
"11448","The only downside that I have found to working at Thomson Reuters is the pay. The pay bands are not made public (which is why I'm on this site in the first place) and once you are hired in you are stuck in the pay structure with promotions meaning almost nothing in terms of pay increases."
"11449","Pay employees what their worth or pretty soon re-treads will just stay gone."
"11450","Very conservative and slow moving company. This is beneficial in slow economic times but not very innovative. Very large amount of paper pushing and layers of management. Causes extremely slow reaction to market conditions and thus slow to nonexistent response to customers. Good people on staff but too much beauracracy to be of good at customer service."
"11451","Quit sending random mass emails and just walk around and genuinely talk to the staff, build raport and then LISTEN and take ACTION instead of forming another committee."
"11452","Due to extensive growth through acquisition, Thomson Reuters often seems to have redundant and top heavy management structures which creates inefficient management and lack of upward mobility.  Thomson Reuters also needs to do a better job of integrating acquired technologies, rather than maintaining vertical silos that essentially continue to function as standalone business units."
"11453","Streamline, streamline, streamline."
"11454","The Thomson culture appears to be much more aggressive with everyone fighting to have their voices heard. The culture has some negative aspects such as copying in lots of people to relatively unimportant emails. They also seem to work much longer hours with emails from Blackberries over Xmas and at strange hours of the day common. perhaps people are just worried about job security."
"11455","Give more communication about the likely impact on jobs of the merger. The integration could have been planned in more detail."
"11456","Too many people have been with the company for a very long time and are not effective.  These people are moved around from position to postiion rather than being let go.  They are overpaid and it sends a bad message to those who work harder and receive much less."
"11457","Weed out the under performers and grow the next layer of management"
"11458","Comparatively low pay. Also sales force seems to run the show which makes it difficult to implement process improvements."
"11459","You really need to have management driving innovation and improvement and not cater to sales whims. We've spent a lot of time and money developing software that streamlines efficiency but because sales refuses to use it  - and management won't make them - the rest of us have to suffer."
"11460","Reorgs can happen with greater frequency than one might hope."
"11461","Help the culture and pride shine in the US as it does in Europe."
"11462","Technology jobs are very demanding, a lot of time (usually 50 to 65 hours work weeks)."
"11463","Let's please be cautious as we look to engage the ""global work force"".  I'm very concerned about the stability, performance, and support of our products as we look to leverage staff across the globe.  I think it's prudent to change as the world around us changes, but let's not risk our flagship products to save dollars in the short term and lose customers in the long term."
"11464","Advancement opportunites can be scarce even for top performers.  Beware of troubled business units.  Can become stale in roles as there's no formal rotation program."
"11465","Company needs to do a getter job of identifing and retaining internal talent.  Employee evaulation process is limited and lacks depth."
"11466","All works are being outsourced to low cost region. The relocation of current employees are messed up, groups are devided up between locations."
"11467","focus on growth rather than cost cutting"
"11468","Too bureaucratic, and location specific limits to growth. Not a whole lot of transperancy with regards to anticipated changes in product mix."
"11469","Delegate and decentralise. Trust your people, and treat work assignments as projects and measure based on their results. Customer feedback to all levels of employees is essential."
"11470","Work/life balance is not supported; manager is not supportive of taking time off.   Micromanaging is the norm.  Employees are stuck working on one area with little hope of learning more.  Employees have the technology to work at home but aren't allowed to.  If you don't work through lunch and stay late, you are a crappy employee.  Parking lot is huge; they have a shuttle in the winter."
"11471","Don't expect employees to work 60 hours a week."
"11472","Dreadful Middle manangement. Bloated workforce, too much emphasis on outdated technology, product managment and marketing. Understand your customers better and make products they want rather than products that you want to create."
"11473","Cut out 50% of the middle managment. Slash marketing and refocus on local markets. Stop work from home initiatives for head Office staff. It's poor for morale when the New York offices are deserted on Fridays."
"11474","Very large company, the left hand and the right hand don't appear to communicate.  This got worse right after the merger.  As with a lot of large companies, layoffs can come from ""out of the blue"" and surprise people.  Also, when the rumors of when layoffs are coming start flying, things seem to drag on, and people become very nervous and defensive during the day to day; instead of focusing on the jobs at hand."
"11475","Keep employees more in the loop, especially as to what technologies are going to be phased out, to prevent the waste of having people working for months on a project that will be scrapped."
"11476","The pay could be better.
For starters, it is overwhelming at the number of applications  and systems to master within a short time span. New employees have quitted because of information overload. In my opinion, enough time should be alocated for training."
"11477","Recognize the achievements of individual contributors"
"11478","Being the result of one large company, Thomson, acquiring another large company, Reuters, there are still some cultural integration issues.  There are pockets of the new company which are heavily ex-Reuters and seem to maintain an arrogance and bias against ex-Thomson employees.  As well, this carries to some managerial positions where less qualified ex-Reuters individuals were favoured over ex-Thomson employees.... Pay is a sore spot with many employees and some inconsistencies between peers-to-peer salary comparisons and 'leveling-up' to equate pay across similar functions"
"11479","Start breaking down silos between different groups and strive for a more diverse mix of ex-Reuters and ex-Thomson management.  This might lead to some conflict in the short term but will lead to better results longer-term.  Start weeding out those who fail to adopt a Thomson Reuters identity and crack-down on 'us vs. them' in-fighting.  Push the culture message harder"
"11480","Severely disorganized because nearly everyone is new. Both employees and management make up the rules as they go. There's very little accountability. There are some old-timers but most people leave for greener pastures after a year or two. Thomson was a lot more laid-back before the merge with Reuters. There's a distinct air of paranoia because some jobs have already been outsourced to India."
"11481","A company of this size should have higher salaries and better training in order to decrease turnover."
"11482","They outsource American jobs to India; very top heavy in management."
"11483","Stop micromanaging your departments, trust the employees you have hired to do the job. Be consistent. You read about Thomson in the news as a flexible workplace or excellent for working mothers. It really depends on your manager. One department next to you is very flexible while yours is not."
"11484","Senior management is somewhat uninspiring"
"11485","Reward staffers who question your judgment rather than squelching them. Journalists should question and should be rewarded for it, not punished."
"11486","The size of the corporation can be limiting - an increasingly large number of projects, services and initiatives are being centralized/corporatized in ways which do not suit every business unit ideally."
"11487","Less attempts to shove a square peg into a round hole in the sake of uniformity may help. Also, there are surely areas of the business which could stand to be paid more attention in regards to efficacy of management not only in keeping afloat, but in making honest progress in the field."
"11488","In my experience: frequent disorganization internally - I encountered many areas that still seemed to be figuring out their roles and how they wanted to operate which could create delays in whatever you may need for doing your  job - no standards on process or project methodologies - many groups doing their ""own thing;"" office politics can frequently get in the way of communication and cooperation between... departments; the job frequently takes over your life 24/7 - even on vacation or during illness, you're still expected to monitor emails and issues and call into meetings.  You need to understand and decide what you're committing to before you take the job.  Ask detail questions about a typical day on the job with your interviewer to get a better sense of what's required of you."
"11489","I'd recommend more standardization on processes/methodologies (like process and project management) and policies across departments so that employees are working together and speaking the ""same language"".  Also, while everyone knows that overtime to get the job done is a fact of business life, there needs to be some kind of work/life balance and respect for employees' break from the office.  In my old department,... mid level managers were frequently ill from the stress but because they worked non-stop, they'd constantly get sick.  Employees will perform better and produce better quality work if they are able to work out a balance between office time and time with family and necessary physical and mental rest."
"11490","The leadership was lacking in many ways. The amount of work required was very excessive. For example, after I left the position, they had additional people doing  my job part time. They require employees to get up to speed very rapidly without providing adequate training for new employees. The heavy customer service focus is to the detriment of employees. The pay was quite low given the difficulties of the job and... the complex work required on the job."
"11491","I would invest in your people more. There was little or no training so career advancement was non existent. I would  break down barriers between departments,"
"11492","No one seems to know what they are doing. There is a large turnover of employees especially since the merger. Morale is pretty low. Cutting back on money."
"11493","Management is always being transferedTraining and consistency is vital. Recognize your good employees and reward them. You need to communicate with your employees."
"11494","It is a big company, it is very hard to work with other team. 
The manager don't know too much about project management and software development process."
"11495","Hope they can improve the culture in the company."
"11496","The pay tends to be lower in equivalent job positions, and supervisors and managers often aren't empowered to compensate their staff as they feel may be warranted.
Often I've seen people in job roles making far less than they would make in the same position at another company."
"11497","Please keep evaluating salary ranges, and work towards bringing compensation for the experienced and talented people that you have up to where it should be.
Also, please bring back the 360-degree reviews (where employees are given the opportunity to give feedback to their managers/supervisors)."
"11498","There are some downsides of working at Thomson Reuters.  The culture tends to be quite bureaucratic and conforming to process is generally valued more than actual work-related accomplishments like solving a problem for a customer.  There are constant training classes and eLearning seminars for new products and systems and almost none of it is applicable to most jobs.  
The pay is not great but you accept that since... you're getting 4 and 5 weeks vacation and they let you work four 10-hour shifts."
"11499","I would tell Senior Management that they should start removing some layers of middle-managers and then grant more autonomy to the lower-level managers and team-leads.  There seem to be middle-managers who exist only to break your chops about doing TPS reports...
Also, they need to streamline some of the administrative overhead that adds to our workload so we can devote more of our workday to problems that affect... clients."
"11500","Very old school and hierarchical. They even don't have the work from home option, it need special permission. Holiday hours are very closely counted. No laptops for even senior engineers. Office environment is very professional, but there is a general lack of friendliness amongst the people here. The HR negotiated too hard over salary."
"11501","Loosen-up. Trust your people a bit more."
"11502","Low salary and bonus in comparison with other financial institution. Management is not good in motivating staff and they do not have interest in retaining talented staff within the company"
"11503","Management should be able to motivate employees and give a fair reward to avoid aristrocracy. Better  training for manager will increase staff productivity"
"11504","Some of the managers within the company are slow to change in their way of thinking. If it's been done a certain way in the past, even if it does not make sense given the current setting, certain areas of the business are resistant to change. I see this primarily in the ways the Baby Boomer generation interacts with the growing  Gen Y workforce. I feel that Gen Y employees are frustrated with the expectations of... Baby Boomer managers with regards to alternative work arrangements (such as telecommuting or flexible work hours) and what the two generations consider to be a good work-life balance in general."
"11505","If you value your human capital and would like to build a more loyal workforce with your Gen Y employees, push management thought in the direction managing to achieve results and boost productivity instead of ensuring a certain amount of ""face time""."
"11506","There is not much sharing about the future of the products and services that are sales is expected to sell.  The health coverage is below average."
"11507","Involve employees more in discussions about future planning."
"11508","My immediate supervisor treated myself and other employees in a callous and insensitive manner, micromanaged my work, and implied that I was not doing my part, despite frequent client compliments and consistently meeting billable hours goals.  Within an 18-month period, my supervisor achieved a 100% turnover within her team--which included myself as well as several other employees who had been with the company... between 5-8 years.  My supervisor's supervisor allowed this to happen, and even participated in some of the maltreatment.

In addition, there is no internal training for employees to be able to learn the product or technologies related to the product.  As a result, employee development and opportunities are sorely lacking, as is customer service, since employees are unable to increase their knowledge and skills."
"11509","I would recommend re-instituting an employee development program.  

I would strongly recommend that senior managers/directors keep close tabs on employee turnover, and institute anonymous employee feedback so that any potential manager problems can be quickly identified and fixed."
"11510","Cut-throat management would throw anybody under the bus to avoid taking responsibility for making a bad decision."
"11511","Hire more people to do work and fewer to direct the few who are left to do the work."
"11512","The company expects salaried employees to work overtime without pay, but this is not disclosed during the hiring process.  On the other hand, contract and hourly paid employees are kept to the 40 hour week with overtime kept to a minimum.  It is a very lopsided arrangement with the salaried employees taking home less per hour, as well as, creating a disproportionate work/life balance.

New hires are paid more than... present employees for doing the same job.  Pay increases are kept to a minimum for most, so the pay scale for existing employees never catches up to the new hires.  The longer you stay, the wider the financial gap between you and the new recruits.

Nepotism abounds at Thomson.  Only a select few are recognized or rewarded for their achievements.  Many of these people get recognized for the same work other people do; however they are favored by management, so they receive the recognition while the others go unnoticed.  These same management favored people also get promoted into management positions.  

Those who get promoted are not necessarily the best qualified.  Some managers (not all) lack management skills but brown nose their way up the ladder.  Some use mental abuse tactics to keep the employees in line by eroding their self esteem.  In addition, it is hard to remove these managers because upper management sometimes blames the subordinate employees for the shortcoming of the manager.  Also, some employees are allowed to bump themselves up more than one level in the organization while others are told they cannot.  

Be careful what job you enter into the company with.  Many of the positions will leave you with no outside marketable skills because a lot of the skills you acquire on the job are Thomson Reuters proprietary skills.  When employees hire in management tells them that there are many opportunities for lateral and upward moves; however changing job types within the organization are virtually non existent.  You quickly become directly associated with the title and job you start with.  

As for advancement opportunities, you are allowed to try out for any position within the organization; however your efforts are often futile because the hiring decisions are often made before the interview process.  Sometimes you get lucky and over come the odds but that is not the norm."
"11513","Learn to think outside the box.  Don't just promote employees who emulate your thinking, and don't be afraid of opposing opinions.  To get new ideas and real corporate growth you need opinions other than your own.  No one individual has the market on great ideas and having a group of like minded individuals results Monotonous output.

Everyone has a different skill set and talent.  Don't be afraid of those who... possess skills you don't have which could put them above you in the chain of command.  Holding them back can only hinder the companies growth and yours.

Thomson Reuters policy of not divulging salaries is designed to promote unfair salary practices.  It is obvious that the company doesn't want the employees to know when they are being grossly underpaid.  Pay employees fairly and make sure the existing employees are compensated more than new recruits.  Openly post job pay scales for the individual positions and abolish the stupid pay bands that are so broad and undefined that even Sherlock Holmes could not figure them out.  

Disclose the hierarchy of jobs within the organization and what is need to get to the next level. Disclose the salary for that position and the jobs which are lateral as well as above and below the position.  Stick to that plan!  No bumping up favorite people two or more levels to the top.  Make everyone equal in the hiring process."
"11514","Technology - wise, they are behind the times. Especially within some organizations within the thomson reuters umbrella, it is very difficult to improve ones technical skills. management is slow to recognize the need for change, and even when they do change, are quick to fall back on old habits in the face of challenging situations."
"11515","Senior management should be more interactive and visible even to grassroots levels of the company."
"11516","The company is getting so large so quickly that some of the basic core values are sometimes overlooked.  Merging all the smaller companies together has been extremely bumpy for employees and ever more so for customers.  For example, the customer service department is seriously understaffed which makes things difficult for everyone; especially customers. 
The internal communication from Senior Management is decent... but the inter-departmental communication definitely needs some improvement.  There are times when a simple task takes on a higher degree of difficulty simply because the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  It's a known issue that's the company is working very hard to remedy."
"11517","Your employees drive the company so make sure you give them proper direction."
"11518","They are not a technology company but are trying to leverage it in their businesses and do not always have the technical expertise to deliver a sound technical product which can lead to customer satisfaction issues."
"11519","Leverage techology more in gaining competitive edge."
"11520","Clueless upper management; promotions not based on merit; too many reorgs (1 every six months!)"
"11521","Employees are the real assets for any financial information services company. SM clearly doesn't have a clue on how to retain talent."
"11522","Software development at Reuters was a complete mess.  Too many products were being developed in too many places, which eventually led to lots of layoffs.  The entire company seemed very disjointed.  When people were laid off, there was no thought given to performance, only to geographical location."
"11523","Make sure you keep the right people on the bus."
"11524","Not all business units are the same.  Healthcare is a terrible unit to work for compared to Creative Solutions."
"11525","Thank you for effectively managing your people and not just focusing on projects, for it is the people that complete and deliver the projects.  Healthcare could learn a lot from CS’s management."
"11526","Too much corporate politics (which you'd get anywhere, though), turnover is high within the company, parking can be rough, always facing reorgs and change management,"
"11527","More communication to middle management and all employees, working at such a big company can cause communication to suffer"
"11528","Too many project managers with little or no understanding of what they are managing, adding no value to a project.  Senior management believe moving as much work as possible to low cost offshore locations is the answer to all of their problems."
"11529","."
"11530","People who worked on the Thomson Financial side are just waiting for the Reuters people to get shot of them. I understand the place has become massively more bureacratic since the merger. Rumours that Reuters regards itself as a branch of the British civil service appear to be true."
"11531","Ask why, prior to the merger between Thomson Financial (TF) and Reuters, senior management at TF were targetting Reuters as an easy target, whereas Bloomberg customers were aa much harder group to lure away. Stop migrating jobs relating to your major cash cows to Bangalore; they don't understand the products and they don't care enough about them to devote 10, 20 or even 30 years of their career to them (10 months... would be an achievement)."
"11532","Management does not listen to staff. Attempting to 'clone' us all and lose our individuality as relationship managers. Too many middle managers, too much report writing, too many reviews."
"11533","Realise that just because you said it, it does not make it the best solution."
"11534","The segment marketing organization is a living embodiment of the Peter principle, with too many chiefs and not enough worker bees.  They spend lots of money on themselves, promote only from within, and make life miserable for the rest of the company.  There are good people in the organization, but they're drowned out by the idiots in charge and the high number of layers of management that insulate senior leadership... from good ideas.  New Product Development is OK, but too product-focused and not good listeners to the strategy folks (although they are correct in ignoring the segment marketers).  The sales organization is focused on their numbers, and when they're not hitting them, they whine a lot."
"11535","Blow up segment marketing, especially on the law firm side.  Cut the number of directors and senior directors by two thirds, but keep the head count for marketers who have direct marketing and channel management experience (as opposed to lawyers from the customer experience operations organization).  Beef up technology infrastructure, start by identifying technology bottlenecks (like the data warehouse) and... investing in them rather than viewing infrastructure as a mere cost center."
"11536","The products and salary packages are widely believed to be inferior to those of our main competitor, Bloomberg (although the seemingly rigid, dictatorial and New York-centred management style there holds little attraction for most of us).
The legacy of the past mistakes at Reuters left CEO Tom Glocer with little choice but to cut costs. He rose to the challenge and wowed Wall Street with his ability to hack the... flab. But the pressure on editorial budgets is still cruelly tight, while many of our colleagues on the sales side (and in management) seem to jet around the world unaware of any squeeze. And Glocer continues, in his new role as the boss of the merged entity, to splurge massive amounts of  money on share buybacks. Meanwhile my desk phone works so badly that I am constantly having to pretend that it's a bad line and ask people to repeat themselves. In fact our technology is generally dreadful. Phones, computers, antiquated editorial systems, internal communications... We've been promised a revamp... right now it's just embarrassing."
"11537","Stop frittering away our hard-saved cash on share buybacks, the stockmarket is loopy enough without you trying to prop up our share price like King Canute trying to turn back the tide. Use some of it to refresh our internal systems instead. Keep fighting the flab on the business side, but recognise that the pips are already squeaking in the journalism budgets.
Above all Tom, show us that you are a business builder,... not just a cutter!!"
"11538","Management cares only about the appearance of things and not for real suggestions for improving processes.  Promotions and advancement are not based on ability and people magically appear in higher positions when no one else knew that a position was open.  
Compensation and pay raises are too closely tied to an immediate supervisor's personal opinion of an employee.  Despite the fact that the reviews are supposed... to be objective and based on facts, when managers fail to follow this procedure, there is no recourse.
I had a rotating array of at least half a dozen people to whom I reported to at any given moment."
"11539","Cull the herd of numerous middle managers that contribute nothing to the company other than filling chairs in constant and unnecessary meetings.
Institute procedures to allow employees to have a voice in the review of management."
"11540","Huge and bureucratic.  The same projects and products get implemented over and over again in slightly different ways.  Every manager fights for a bigger slice of the pie by promising the world without regards to whether or not the team can deliver.  Almost no-one knows enough about what they are supposed to be doing to do it effectively.  Those that are in the know hoard information."
"11541","Implement programs to develop your existing staff rather than always looking to outsourcing/offshoring to cut costs.  There is vast waste and duplication of effort at TR and this problem will not go away until there is concentrated effort on addressing the issue."
"11542","Very inflexible with work arrangements. Almost no working from home is allowed in my department (technology)."
"11543","We need to stay competitive in the technology industry and do more to keep talented software engineers here. Many other company are much more flexible with schedules and working from home and have more competitive salaries. We need to find a way to make it work, especially in this economy with gas prices as they are."
"11544","Thomson is essentially a collection of smaller companies that they have acquired over the years. Now they are trying to merge all of these different companies and financial information products into one big product. This ignores the niche markets that some of the acquired companies were serving. The big product they are feeding everything into has a lousy user interface and poor performance. I bet this has only... gotten worse with the Reuters merger."
"11545","Don't sacrifice the niche markets and products in order to force everyone into Thomson One."
"11546","Job security, massive conglomerate, new corporate ethos. There is a lot of ill feeeling between legacy Reuters and legacy Thomson employess as to which is the best way to do things and the impression of ""job stealing"" when someone is let go and a person from the other side slips into the job."
"11547","Communicate better - you know what the long term plans are - let the staff know as well."
"11548","Salaries tend to be low compared to other industries. The differences with money paid in Banking or Investment are quite shocking.
There's no official back-up for said flexible working, there are no clear rules, it's up to your manager to determine whether you can work form home or not, and it's knonw that some managers are strongly opposed to this option. A clear policy should be written so that workers could... refer to it.
Morale is low after the merge. Things are changing. It seems Thomson was not such a good company in terms of benefits and some of the good Reuters policies have not been adopted in the US. There has been a harmonisation in the UK. Lots of people are leaving."
"11549","Improve salaries and do not go backwards in work/life balance polices as  you are doing in the US. Do REALLY take the best of both companies and keep it."
"11550","There are a lot of politics at the higher levels of the company.  They do not regularly share information across business units.  HR is horrible.  They do not pay for performance.  Raises for top performers are usually around 3.5% to 4.5%, while raises for poor performers are usually between 2% and 3%.  They do not try to attract top talent."
"11551","Attract better talent and pay for performance.  Do not be so short-term focused on financial results.  Many managers push revenue to the balance sheet or overstate expense accruals to bank for the next year.  Also, keep a close eye on your software capitalization (FAS86 and 98-1) and acquisition accounting."
"11552","Multiple owned companies with similar businesses create a negative competitive environment; layers of bureacracy that comes with larger companies; Continuous buying and selling businesses creates lack of employee stability and often duplicative job functions."
"11553","Work to insure consistency in message internally to employees, especially in business acquisitions."
"11554","Pay is average.  Some management positions are not posted."
"11555","Keep up the communication.  Keep an eye on the new generation (Millenials) and how they operate/what motivates them."
"11556","If you are in the Eagan office, then you are in the center of the universe.  In the field, it can be difficult to get things done without travelling out to Minnesota."
"11557","For a large organization, West is fairly nimble and there are a lot of smart people in the organization."
"11558","Thomson Reuters is still in the process of integrating the two businesses (Thomson & Reuters) after the April 2008 acquisition. Once that is complete things will run a lot smoother. Until then, everyone has to operate with a ""change as a way of life"" attitude."
"11559","I think it varies from business to business. Overall, I would tell the Thomson Reuters Senior Management to continue with the open & frequesnt communication startegy that they started before the acquisition was finalized. True commitment to an open and honest communication strategy is critical to maintaining an employee population that is engaged and wants to grow themselves and the business."
"11560","Lack of vision for the future"
"11561","Too many restructures resulting in failures of senior management being covered up. Cost savings do not result in innovation.

"11567","It's o.k. to do salary reviews every year as you claim,  but without wage adjustments, you're just training people for other companies.
