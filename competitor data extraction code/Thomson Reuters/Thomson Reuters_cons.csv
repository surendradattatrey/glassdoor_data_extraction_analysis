"1","Things are in a state of flux due to the recent merger.  Many people still don't know how things will shake out in general, or individually."
"2","Lack of vision for the future"
"3","Like  many of corporations, lots of new dev is being outsourced."
"4","Upper management has no idea what they are doing.  Most recent major example was deciding to lay off a huge percentage of IT employees in the US and hire new ones in Beijing.  They lost decades (centuries?) of experience doing this and did not even consider that in Beijing the employees get paid triple time for working outside normal business hours (so 24 hour support would cost a ton)."
"5","Twice yearly survey is not tied into pay or promotions. They will give you more responsibilities, sometimes a new title, but they will probably never give you salary wise what they are willing to pay, someone right off the street.  No career path, very few promotions from within, little training to be promoted and if promoted, no wage adjustment.  Too much on call.  Free with praise, trinkets and 'at a boys' but not... money, current salary 20% under street average.  Too may ways to be fired. These are my opinions."
"6","Distance between different working groups."
"7","Career advancement is difficult. You can stay in sales or account management, take a pay cut to go in to management and then wait for years to progress after that."
"8","The job we do is not comparable to other positions in the company, we are a small unit."
"9","Big sluggish machine. Although streamlining the product offering, there are still too many out there. Very much a Boys' club. CEO and COO are Harvard mates. Too many management layers and the 'fast forward' intent of weeding out old wood somehow also weeded out key creators within the company. Benefits vary greatly depending on location. Not a great payer."
"10","Benefits have continued to erode and I am not sure when we will hit bottom. Maybe when the job market becomes more competitive?"
"11","Management cares only about the appearance of things and not for real suggestions for improving processes.  Promotions and advancement are not based on ability and people magically appear in higher positions when no one else knew that a position was open.  
Compensation and pay raises are too closely tied to an immediate supervisor's personal opinion of an employee.  Despite the fact that the reviews are supposed... to be objective and based on facts, when managers fail to follow this procedure, there is no recourse.
I had a rotating array of at least half a dozen people to whom I reported to at any given moment."
"12","Huge and bureucratic.  The same projects and products get implemented over and over again in slightly different ways.  Every manager fights for a bigger slice of the pie by promising the world without regards to whether or not the team can deliver.  Almost no-one knows enough about what they are supposed to be doing to do it effectively.  Those that are in the know hoard information."
"13","Very inflexible with work arrangements. Almost no working from home is allowed in my department (technology)."
"14","Thomson is essentially a collection of smaller companies that they have acquired over the years. Now they are trying to merge all of these different companies and financial information products into one big product. This ignores the niche markets that some of the acquired companies were serving. The big product they are feeding everything into has a lousy user interface and poor performance. I bet this has only... gotten worse with the Reuters merger."
"15","Job security, massive conglomerate, new corporate ethos. There is a lot of ill feeeling between legacy Reuters and legacy Thomson employess as to which is the best way to do things and the impression of ""job stealing"" when someone is let go and a person from the other side slips into the job."
"16","Salaries tend to be low compared to other industries. The differences with money paid in Banking or Investment are quite shocking.
There's no official back-up for said flexible working, there are no clear rules, it's up to your manager to determine whether you can work form home or not, and it's knonw that some managers are strongly opposed to this option. A clear policy should be written so that workers could... refer to it.
Morale is low after the merge. Things are changing. It seems Thomson was not such a good company in terms of benefits and some of the good Reuters policies have not been adopted in the US. There has been a harmonisation in the UK. Lots of people are leaving."
"17","There are a lot of politics at the higher levels of the company.  They do not regularly share information across business units.  HR is horrible.  They do not pay for performance.  Raises for top performers are usually around 3.5% to 4.5%, while raises for poor performers are usually between 2% and 3%.  They do not try to attract top talent."
"18","Multiple owned companies with similar businesses create a negative competitive environment; layers of bureacracy that comes with larger companies; Continuous buying and selling businesses creates lack of employee stability and often duplicative job functions."
"19","Pay is average.  Some management positions are not posted."
"20","If you are in the Eagan office, then you are in the center of the universe.  In the field, it can be difficult to get things done without travelling out to Minnesota."
"21","They are not a technology company but are trying to leverage it in their businesses and do not always have the technical expertise to deliver a sound technical product which can lead to customer satisfaction issues."
"22","Clueless upper management; promotions not based on merit; too many reorgs (1 every six months!)"
"23","Software development at Reuters was a complete mess.  Too many products were being developed in too many places, which eventually led to lots of layoffs.  The entire company seemed very disjointed.  When people were laid off, there was no thought given to performance, only to geographical location."
"24","Not all business units are the same.  Healthcare is a terrible unit to work for compared to Creative Solutions."
"25","Too much corporate politics (which you'd get anywhere, though), turnover is high within the company, parking can be rough, always facing reorgs and change management,"
"26","Too many project managers with little or no understanding of what they are managing, adding no value to a project.  Senior management believe moving as much work as possible to low cost offshore locations is the answer to all of their problems."
"27","People who worked on the Thomson Financial side are just waiting for the Reuters people to get shot of them. I understand the place has become massively more bureacratic since the merger. Rumours that Reuters regards itself as a branch of the British civil service appear to be true."
"28","Management does not listen to staff. Attempting to 'clone' us all and lose our individuality as relationship managers. Too many middle managers, too much report writing, too many reviews."
"29","The segment marketing organization is a living embodiment of the Peter principle, with too many chiefs and not enough worker bees.  They spend lots of money on themselves, promote only from within, and make life miserable for the rest of the company.  There are good people in the organization, but they're drowned out by the idiots in charge and the high number of layers of management that insulate senior leadership... from good ideas.  New Product Development is OK, but too product-focused and not good listeners to the strategy folks (although they are correct in ignoring the segment marketers).  The sales organization is focused on their numbers, and when they're not hitting them, they whine a lot."
"30","The products and salary packages are widely believed to be inferior to those of our main competitor, Bloomberg (although the seemingly rigid, dictatorial and New York-centred management style there holds little attraction for most of us).
The legacy of the past mistakes at Reuters left CEO Tom Glocer with little choice but to cut costs. He rose to the challenge and wowed Wall Street with his ability to hack the... flab. But the pressure on editorial budgets is still cruelly tight, while many of our colleagues on the sales side (and in management) seem to jet around the world unaware of any squeeze. And Glocer continues, in his new role as the boss of the merged entity, to splurge massive amounts of  money on share buybacks. Meanwhile my desk phone works so badly that I am constantly having to pretend that it's a bad line and ask people to repeat themselves. In fact our technology is generally dreadful. Phones, computers, antiquated editorial systems, internal communications... We've been promised a revamp... right now it's just embarrassing."
"31","There are some downsides of working at Thomson Reuters.  The culture tends to be quite bureaucratic and conforming to process is generally valued more than actual work-related accomplishments like solving a problem for a customer.  There are constant training classes and eLearning seminars for new products and systems and almost none of it is applicable to most jobs.  
The pay is not great but you accept that since... you're getting 4 and 5 weeks vacation and they let you work four 10-hour shifts."
"32","Very old school and hierarchical. They even don't have the work from home option, it need special permission. Holiday hours are very closely counted. No laptops for even senior engineers. Office environment is very professional, but there is a general lack of friendliness amongst the people here. The HR negotiated too hard over salary."
"33","Low salary and bonus in comparison with other financial institution. Management is not good in motivating staff and they do not have interest in retaining talented staff within the company"
"34","Some of the managers within the company are slow to change in their way of thinking. If it's been done a certain way in the past, even if it does not make sense given the current setting, certain areas of the business are resistant to change. I see this primarily in the ways the Baby Boomer generation interacts with the growing  Gen Y workforce. I feel that Gen Y employees are frustrated with the expectations of... Baby Boomer managers with regards to alternative work arrangements (such as telecommuting or flexible work hours) and what the two generations consider to be a good work-life balance in general."
"35","Involve employees more in discussions about future planning."
"36","My immediate supervisor treated myself and other employees in a callous and insensitive manner, micromanaged my work, and implied that I was not doing my part, despite frequent client compliments and consistently meeting billable hours goals.  Within an 18-month period, my supervisor achieved a 100% turnover within her team--which included myself as well as several other employees who had been with the company... between 5-8 years.  My supervisor's supervisor allowed this to happen, and even participated in some of the maltreatment.

In addition, there is no internal training for employees to be able to learn the product or technologies related to the product.  As a result, employee development and opportunities are sorely lacking, as is customer service, since employees are unable to increase their knowledge and skills."
"37","Cut-throat management would throw anybody under the bus to avoid taking responsibility for making a bad decision."
"38","The company expects salaried employees to work overtime without pay, but this is not disclosed during the hiring process.  On the other hand, contract and hourly paid employees are kept to the 40 hour week with overtime kept to a minimum.  It is a very lopsided arrangement with the salaried employees taking home less per hour, as well as, creating a disproportionate work/life balance.

New hires are paid more than... present employees for doing the same job.  Pay increases are kept to a minimum for most, so the pay scale for existing employees never catches up to the new hires.  The longer you stay, the wider the financial gap between you and the new recruits.

Nepotism abounds at Thomson.  Only a select few are recognized or rewarded for their achievements.  Many of these people get recognized for the same work other people do; however they are favored by management, so they receive the recognition while the others go unnoticed.  These same management favored people also get promoted into management positions.  

Those who get promoted are not necessarily the best qualified.  Some managers (not all) lack management skills but brown nose their way up the ladder.  Some use mental abuse tactics to keep the employees in line by eroding their self esteem.  In addition, it is hard to remove these managers because upper management sometimes blames the subordinate employees for the shortcoming of the manager.  Also, some employees are allowed to bump themselves up more than one level in the organization while others are told they cannot.  

Be careful what job you enter into the company with.  Many of the positions will leave you with no outside marketable skills because a lot of the skills you acquire on the job are Thomson Reuters proprietary skills.  When employees hire in management tells them that there are many opportunities for lateral and upward moves; however changing job types within the organization are virtually non existent.  You quickly become directly associated with the title and job you start with.  

As for advancement opportunities, you are allowed to try out for any position within the organization; however your efforts are often futile because the hiring decisions are often made before the interview process.  Sometimes you get lucky and over come the odds but that is not the norm."
"39","Technology - wise, they are behind the times. Especially within some organizations within the thomson reuters umbrella, it is very difficult to improve ones technical skills. management is slow to recognize the need for change, and even when they do change, are quick to fall back on old habits in the face of challenging situations."
"40","The company is getting so large so quickly that some of the basic core values are sometimes overlooked.  Merging all the smaller companies together has been extremely bumpy for employees and ever more so for customers.  For example, the customer service department is seriously understaffed which makes things difficult for everyone; especially customers. 
The internal communication from Senior Management is decent... but the inter-departmental communication definitely needs some improvement.  There are times when a simple task takes on a higher degree of difficulty simply because the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  It's a known issue that's the company is working very hard to remedy."
"41","Being the result of one large company, Thomson, acquiring another large company, Reuters, there are still some cultural integration issues.  There are pockets of the new company which are heavily ex-Reuters and seem to maintain an arrogance and bias against ex-Thomson employees.  As well, this carries to some managerial positions where less qualified ex-Reuters individuals were favoured over ex-Thomson employees.... Pay is a sore spot with many employees and some inconsistencies between peers-to-peer salary comparisons and 'leveling-up' to equate pay across similar functions"
"42","Severely disorganized because nearly everyone is new. Both employees and management make up the rules as they go. There's very little accountability. There are some old-timers but most people leave for greener pastures after a year or two. Thomson was a lot more laid-back before the merge with Reuters. There's a distinct air of paranoia because some jobs have already been outsourced to India."
"43","They outsource American jobs to India; very top heavy in management."
"44","Senior management is somewhat uninspiring"
"45","The size of the corporation can be limiting - an increasingly large number of projects, services and initiatives are being centralized/corporatized in ways which do not suit every business unit ideally."
"46","In my experience: frequent disorganization internally - I encountered many areas that still seemed to be figuring out their roles and how they wanted to operate which could create delays in whatever you may need for doing your  job - no standards on process or project methodologies - many groups doing their ""own thing;"" office politics can frequently get in the way of communication and cooperation between... departments; the job frequently takes over your life 24/7 - even on vacation or during illness, you're still expected to monitor emails and issues and call into meetings.  You need to understand and decide what you're committing to before you take the job.  Ask detail questions about a typical day on the job with your interviewer to get a better sense of what's required of you."
"47","The leadership was lacking in many ways. The amount of work required was very excessive. For example, after I left the position, they had additional people doing  my job part time. They require employees to get up to speed very rapidly without providing adequate training for new employees. The heavy customer service focus is to the detriment of employees. The pay was quite low given the difficulties of the job and... the complex work required on the job."
"48","No one seems to know what they are doing. There is a large turnover of employees especially since the merger. Morale is pretty low. Cutting back on money."
"49","It is a big company, it is very hard to work with other team. 
The manager don't know too much about project management and software development process."
"50","The pay tends to be lower in equivalent job positions, and supervisors and managers often aren't empowered to compensate their staff as they feel may be warranted.
Often I've seen people in job roles making far less than they would make in the same position at another company."
"51","The NASC(North American Service Center) is just completing a large job restructuring by bringing all business level accounting into one location.  Little to know resources, training, recongnition and high turnover are to be expected."
"52","Reorgs can happen with greater frequency than one might hope."
"53","Technology jobs are very demanding, a lot of time (usually 50 to 65 hours work weeks)."
"54","Advancement opportunites can be scarce even for top performers.  Beware of troubled business units.  Can become stale in roles as there's no formal rotation program."
"55","All works are being outsourced to low cost region. The relocation of current employees are messed up, groups are devided up between locations."
"56","Too bureaucratic, and location specific limits to growth. Not a whole lot of transperancy with regards to anticipated changes in product mix."
"57","Work/life balance is not supported; manager is not supportive of taking time off.   Micromanaging is the norm.  Employees are stuck working on one area with little hope of learning more.  Employees have the technology to work at home but aren't allowed to.  If you don't work through lunch and stay late, you are a crappy employee.  Parking lot is huge; they have a shuttle in the winter."
"58","Dreadful Middle manangement. Bloated workforce, too much emphasis on outdated technology, product managment and marketing. Understand your customers better and make products they want rather than products that you want to create."
"59","Very large company, the left hand and the right hand don't appear to communicate.  This got worse right after the merger.  As with a lot of large companies, layoffs can come from ""out of the blue"" and surprise people.  Also, when the rumors of when layoffs are coming start flying, things seem to drag on, and people become very nervous and defensive during the day to day; instead of focusing on the jobs at hand."
"60","The pay could be better.
For starters, it is overwhelming at the number of applications  and systems to master within a short time span. New employees have quitted because of information overload. In my opinion, enough time should be alocated for training."
"61","Comparatively low pay. Also sales force seems to run the show which makes it difficult to implement process improvements."
"62","As a software engineer, the biggest downside for me working at Thomson Reuters is that it's not a software company; it's an information company. This company doesn't innovate in the technology field. For those who are interested in using the latest technologies that other companies offer but aren't interested in innovating in the field of technology yourself, this might be a good fit for you."
"63","That perhaps Thomson Reuters is a very large company and somewhat unwieldy."
"64","Because the Cleveland office is relatively small, there is very little opportunity for advancement, unless you consider moving to one of the bigger offices is Rochester, New York or Eagan, Minnesota.
Upper management doesn't know what's really going on around the office and tends to promote and praise employees who don't necessarily deserve it."
"65","The company is changing a bit to being strictly focused on shareholder value. The integration taking place will challenge, it seems, the culture that long time employees have enjoyed. I am not overly concerned about this, as a new employee, it seems that the company is moving toward a culture that is more realistic for a publically traded company. But that does not mean that it will not be a tough transition. The... company does a nice job of creating positive messaging around change initiatives. But some of the response is starting to turn towards more skepticism. it will be interesting to see how that plays out."
"66","Visibility is not clear into the future given the recent merger; Potential culture conflict between the two companies; Woodbridge is not necessarily committed to any specific businesses"
"67","I didn't like the consulting lifestyle.  Consultant don't share knowledge."
"68","Like all workplaces there are politics that is demotivating.  Upper management has very little transparency."
"69","Hard core politics run through the entire company and business unit leadership is more concerned with looking good internally than meeting and exceeding client expectations and actually running a business.  This type of behavior does not bode well for development of managers and directors who must play the political game or run to a different business unit to ""start over""."
"70","It seems management all know each other far too well and look out for one another as opposed to their subordinates.  One must be able to learn and live with corporate politics to get anywhere in this company.  In it's defense, I think they are on par with many other large corporations."
"71","Management has no clue what they are doing, and do not welcome change that could spur growth for the company.  I worked long hours, but most work regular hours.  Not much training (thrown into the fire) and poor communication from higher ups.  I was really disappointed in the direction of the company as it is very old school styled."
"72","Too large of a company. Some people do get overlooked. Working for a public company has its drawbacks as sometimes the company is more focused on its shareholders rather than its employees."
"73","Usual cons for global company such as organization and project management issues between teams separated by thousands of miles."
"74","Large company with lots of layers. I am one removed from a VP, but very far from the CEO. It could take a long time to climb this corporate ladder and I suspect that if you don't have an MBA from a top ten business school, you probably not possible."
"75","Absolutely everything is analyzed and reviewed.  There is nothing that isn't measured or critiqued.  This becomes difficult at times.  Often, many in management seem to only have positions to manage others...positions are there only to manage other positions.  Often, many are seem wondering around. Often we have no idea what they really do.  The overlap in management is very high and needs to be reduced."
"76","The only downside that I have found to working at Thomson Reuters is the pay. The pay bands are not made public (which is why I'm on this site in the first place) and once you are hired in you are stuck in the pay structure with promotions meaning almost nothing in terms of pay increases."
"77","Very conservative and slow moving company. This is beneficial in slow economic times but not very innovative. Very large amount of paper pushing and layers of management. Causes extremely slow reaction to market conditions and thus slow to nonexistent response to customers. Good people on staff but too much beauracracy to be of good at customer service."
"78","Due to extensive growth through acquisition, Thomson Reuters often seems to have redundant and top heavy management structures which creates inefficient management and lack of upward mobility.  Thomson Reuters also needs to do a better job of integrating acquired technologies, rather than maintaining vertical silos that essentially continue to function as standalone business units."
"79","The Thomson culture appears to be much more aggressive with everyone fighting to have their voices heard. The culture has some negative aspects such as copying in lots of people to relatively unimportant emails. They also seem to work much longer hours with emails from Blackberries over Xmas and at strange hours of the day common. perhaps people are just worried about job security."
"80","Too many people have been with the company for a very long time and are not effective.  These people are moved around from position to postiion rather than being let go.  They are overpaid and it sends a bad message to those who work harder and receive much less."
"81","May colleagues who don't have a good perspective of the customer.  Can be bureacratic and slow moving especially for those use to a more entreprenueruial environment."
"82","Slow moving culture and at times very political.  Eagan MN location has tremendous resources but is very hard to accomplish anything due to MN culture.  Compensation is fair, however superstar performers are not capable of driving for higher compensation."
"83","They are over-reacting to the recession and therefore undervaluing and taking advantage of their employees."
"84","Promotion is cliquey - friends of managers get the jobs - and not based on merit or performance in current job.  Recent cull - with no transparency or visible process on decisions on selection of managers - folowing acquisition and integration of Reuters,. Need for quality on operations and project deliverables is satisfied by rigourous but frustrating processes."
"85","The company has a very slow pace, as it is too big to move fast."
"86","There's no onsite cafeteria at the Ann Arbor office but plenty of places to get drinks and food. Overtime is expected but that's the same in every exempt, salaried position. Deadlines could be tough but you do not need to stay in the office to do work. Due to the integration of many healthcare units, there is alot of bureaucracy that becomes apparent once people hit the director level and onwards."
"87","Bureaucracy and red tape amongst departments, micro-management, mid-level managers who lack management training, focus on cost-cutting techniques instead of growth from within, overlapping job functions, technologically challenged at times which can be disappointing, nepotism"
"88","To grow to upper level no roadmap or inputs from Team management."
"89","Because each division is allowed to function in its own way, there is no corporate oversight of whether a division is operating in the best interest of the company and its employees."
"90","Thomson Reuters functions as a monarchy.  I firmly believe that all firms provide opportunity and your career is what you make of it.  But, Thomson Reuters makes it very difficult to generate any kind of career path.  It's definitely a tough place to work and feel good about it unless you enter the company as a senior manager or are someone with minimal ambition."
"91","Not enough promotion of people with a product (and technical) focus.  Lack of aggressive technology adoption, market expansion, which is frustrating in the iPhone world."
"92","Unequal salaries for equal job title or responsibilites.  It does not seem fair that a person's salary can differ based on the department they work in.  Pay should be based upon a job title regardless of your department.

Thomson Reuters as a whole has become too large and too top heavy.  With every new announcement, yet another person has been appointed Sr. VP or CO of something.  While the little guys are being... offered severance packages or minimal bonuses, the higher ups keep getting hit with bonuses that nearly equate to the little guys full year salary."
"93","Shrinking industry with intense competition"
"94","Becoming too big of a company.  you are just a number"
"95","No telecommuting widely available, but should be."
"96","I did not have a good experience with my position and my supervisors.  Also, when I was interviewing I made sure to specify that I was looking for a position where I had a good work/life balance and was not interested in working much more than 40 hours a week (but I did understand I probably would during month and year end).  I was assured they agreed with my needs, however, when I got into the job I was required to... work about 50 hours a week."
"97","Adequate but not great compensation, lack of growth in certain departments, low annual bonus, relatively lacking in 401K choices, sometimes difficult to balance work/life with level of overtime needed during parts of the year.  Heavy dose of politics in upper level positions with lots of movement still after the merger."
"98","Managers are promoted based on sales ability rather than management ability.  Maybe this is a common problem, however, anyone can see that sales ability and management ability often do not overlap."
"99","Cost is king, local staff are always replaced offshore. Top jobs mainly with all the ex-Reuters employees."
"100","Organization is flat, hence getting promoted is very rare.  Some of the employees have been working for more than 5 years, yet they do not get promoted."
"101","Very large company (40,000+) can sometimes make individual employees feel like just one of the masses"
"102","I found that the work itself was quite mundane and not challenging or fulfilling. I had a degree in finance and business management when I joined this company out of college. Looking back I realized that it was probably a poor choice because my daily job duites turned out to be completely irrelevant from my education in finance, and I was really no more than a glorified data entry person."
"103","Thomson tends to have thick layers of management. The top and the bottom do not interact. Very clubby. If you are senior management you will appreciate the front line gatekeeper managers. The company is top heavy and invests heavily in its senior management. This is not a very democratic company. On the face of it, to employees, the company presents a culture of inclusion but I found it to be  very one sided. Talent... does not necessarily serve you well here but being political and building the correct allegiances will be very beneficial."
"104","large company; many long time employees whom are NOT open to new ideas or processes"
"105","Not the best paid companies around."
"106","Draconian management. The management can only be described as incompetent. Because Rockville is not their headquarters, they are mainly focused on giving a good appearance to those in New York. Their incompetence creates problems and then they brag to NY about how they made everyone come in over the weekend to fix a problem they created. The staff turnover is very high and the impression I had was this was a good... thing. The philosophy was to treat employees badly, or treat employees badly in the hopes they'll quit to save on severance. They try to create an atmosphere of you had better not slack off or else. What ends up happening is the good employees quit and the bad employees live in fear of being fired. On top of it all, they're trying to move as much as possible to India."
"107","The work life balance is somewhat lopsided though you are presented with the choice. Also, some individuals who put up walls and do not work as team members are a hinderance to the overall success of projects and the organization."
"108","As part of a large corporation (its even larger know with the merger of Thomson and Reuters),  there are the typical beuracracies and negatives that come with a company of this size.  One of the good things though is that Micromedex is a smaller, almost stand alone, part of the parent.  So this is less of a negative.   The finance group was small, so was little opportunity to advance your career."
"109","It is so big you get a little lost getting things done"
"110","In my industry (legal) there is little opportunity to transfer to another city. But that's because people love their jobs and stay forever."
"111","Management is very shaky - motivational corporate b.s. is a total joke and insulting.  Drink the kool-aid if you really want a chance of moving up."
"112","Old boys club, 95% withe arrogant males, tons of politics, mediocre managment"
"113","Hard to get past being a face in the crowd and not easy to show off your talents or work on new projects.  Office environment is exclusive and somewhat hostile.  Management is often incompetent.  Promotions are rare."
"114","None that I could see."
"115","Compensation could be better.  Large divides without logic in terms of compensation.  Can be highly political at management level, though probably no worse than other similar organisations.  Currently facing a big culture clash following the Thomson - Reuters merger."
"116","Its a very big...over 50,000 staff. Just one year has passed since Thomson acquired Reuters but more synergy is needed."
"117","Big company, leadership tends to play favorites. It can be difficult to move into other roles given the size.  Salaries are not equal across comparable roles.  The tech organization pays much better than the business units for the same role."
"118","There are not a lot of career advancement opportunities. Employees in reference attorneys department were not treated like professionals. When reference attorneys were part of customer experience, it was much better but when they put reference attorneys with sales and account management, the push for sales rather than providing research made the culture no longer a good place to work."
"119","No Security - Company sells businesses and lays off often"
"120","The reality of career advancement is moving into a management position, and never ending meetings.  Human Resources can be frosty sometimes.  Low turnover means you wait longer for promotions, but this is only a downside if you are looking to move up.  Otherwise, not ecstatic but mostly happy employees."
"121","No professional growth or opportunity for advancement, average pay, and incompetent management, especially those in the small law firm segment. The new pay structure does not encourage over achievement. With a larger base salary and smaller commissions, sales reps are not motivated to do much more than necessary."
"122","The sales commission plan and territories seemed to change on a once yearly basis which was quite unstable and did not foster long term relationship building."
"123","Horrible Politics and red tape, Middle management completely out of the loop.  Company moves at a snails pace when it comes to Technology.  No real communication between middle and senior management.  Excessive overlapping of different products competing with each other.  No real Think Tanks, Lack of furthering career and advancements.  Lack of training on new technologies. Manager promises the world but we end up... with nothing."
"124","Territorial conflicts between rival divisions; HQ seems disconnected from those on the frontlines; tough to advance without further education, regardless of work experience."
"125","The location in Eagan is very sterile and lacks culture.  More should be done to promote connectivity between employees."
"126","Not many - some issues around career progression as there is a bit too much ""dead man's shoes"" for promotion prospects, and the good environment means there is little staff turnover."
"127","Although the structure changes regularly they never seem to get the proper balance between the number of reps in the field and the market.  Far too many reps and if you don't get one of the good pieces of turf your days are numbered.  in the past there was a lot of churning of accounts and games played by reps, if you landed on one of those scorched territories you had your work cut out."

Coming up to speed can be difficult. As a new member, you often have to find the right people to talk to, the right documents to read,... and often, explore the code yourself to get familiar. However, self-motivation is a highly valued trait that often lands you instant cash payouts from incentive programs and peer appreciation awards."

It may take a few years (3-5) before your work is recognized and you are considered for advancement."
"134","Customers are confused and angry as to who covers their account.  There is a real need to streamline the account services team structure.  VERY FRAGMENTED.  There is NO ONE internal system to handle the business --billing, AP, AR, entitlements, contracts etc.   There are approximately  15 different internal systems.  There is no interface to combine and streamline a cohesive view of the client--like the ability to... view all products one firm has with ThomsonReuters--when the contracts ends, what the pricing is, products on an invoice that no one at Thomson Rueters knows what it is because it was sunsetted years ago.  Horrible.  Most clients are irate with that aspect of ThomsonReuters and take it out on the account management/salespeople."

"138","Salary is below market rates in my field of work. It is easy to get stuck doing the same job for many years, there is no good career path. Difficult to move into other fields. You will have plenty of opportunity to move and rotate if you are working in the product group, otherwise you are pretty much stuck doing what you always do."
"139","Not much impotence for technology people, employee referral program is not efficient"
"140","Some of the pros of working at TF can also become a con.  For example, the trade off of all the different acquisitions at TF is that there's no real corporate culture since everyone came from a different company.  I also sense a lot of fear of sharing knowledge since people were afraid to divulge their ""secret sauce"" fearing that it make them obsolete and expendable.  There isn't a lot of inter departmental teamwork... and many things are fragmented.  You can work on the same floor with another guy and never know what he works on, what product he builds/supports, or which department he works for.  

There's also a lot of turmoil at the leadership level all the time.  There's no real sense of who's running the show at the top."
"141","Lots of long hours needed to make your numbers. Lots of time must be invested to learn the myriad complex legal products. Training was limited and job was 100% commission when I was there."

"145","There is always a lot of pressure to make a number.  Some of the managers aren't very helpful, but focus on driving reps rather than leading and helping."
"146","The work is excruciatingly boring - a continuous, never-ending data analysis process which saps your will to live. Little attention is paid to the quality of the products, hence in operations there is little pressure to deliver and a tolerance for low quality work. Consequently many jobs are staffed by lazy idiots that wouldn't survive a day in a proper job.

There is little scope for growth in the job. Personal... development and performance appraisals are box ticking exercises. Ambitious people will need to look to their own ingenuity (and connections) in order to progress their career, and smartly shift jobs.

"148","Shocking arrogance towards customers in some divisions"

You will... have around 20 - 30 of these stressful projects happening at once.  It is easy to get burnt out from this job.  When you have to travel to do training for a week, that is incredibly stressful as well.

Working with law firms can be draining in itself.  Lawyers aren't always the easiest to get along with."
"152","In response to revenue declines, senior management has adopted a slash-and-burn strategy of U.S staff (and their generally higher salaries vis-a-vis India) to keep Wall St. analysts happy with the overall profit picture. First it was technology and other back-office functions being moved to India, and now the actual production of content is going there as well. This is all cloaked in the guise of ""diversity"" and... ""globalization"" but it's funny how Caucasian and male the upper ranks of management remain. Apparently diversity is not important at the top levels of the company. Let's face it, it's all about cutting U.S. staff in favor of cheaper labor elsewhere."
"153","They lay off people in good times and bad. They get rid of talented long-time veterans and replace them with cheap, inexperienced labor in Ireland or India. They talk about the quality of their data, and it used to be true. But for a while it's been all talk. They cut departments to the point where people can't do their jobs well, are just trying to survive and will never be able to catch up, much less do something... innovative or different. Politics determine promotions, certainly not competence. I've seen many prosper because of who they know. Certainly not because of what they know."
"154","If you decide to work for this company and you live in the United States, you can be guaranteed you will loose your job to someone in India. After moving job after job to India, the company had the audacity ask the employees to donate funds to the people in India that suffered some kind of loss due to a recent flood. These donations were begged of employees who were notified their jobs would be terminated soon.... 

This company has become so narrowminded and blindsighted that they can't see or hear their own employees' hatred towards them, even though it's clearly expressed in almost every single action they take.  They have repeatedly assured everyone that ""we will all be taken care of"", only to continue to lay off people and send their jobs to India.

"157","Q4 of 09 will probably be ok.  Last year they lowered the quotas to make it more obtainable for sales reps, but wait for the jump next year.   A new sales director is bringing in his own clan to fill out the ranks.  He's good at playing good cop bad cop and very politically savy.  Be careful if you end up on the wrong side or disagree you will either have a short career or a painful one. 

Sales floor has become... more metics driven than sales driven?  Do sales really result in all of the litle spread sheets du jur? Talk time etc or should you allow experienced sales reps to actually have some autonomy?  Probably not.

"159","Shipping jobs to India (under the guise of diversification...labeling employees an intolerant if they question this choice or raise concerns over the affect on the US or local economies). Constant excuses for not including money for training(ie: IPT, etc) in annual budgets(but they can afford to fly scores of Indians to the US, house them for months, and provide training).

Direct management is a complete disaster. Can't even take them seriously. 
No access to sr. management. Not even sure if they know my dept exists. 
Certain people are an HR nightmare.
Stop looking over my shoulder. Feels like a bad real-life version of 1984."
"163","+ Marketplace has changed for legal research and Thomson has not changed with it. While electronic search capacities have changed value proposition for Cases & Statues the Company continues to exact a high premium for its products. Analytical law products are likely the next segment to go.
+ Sales reps have rightfully concluded that finance and HR are making the decisions with regard to sales. Sales and retention... efforts are being undermined by short-term finance-driven goals.
+ Extremely political sales structure. Work achievements should speak for themselves but here you need to hire a Public Relations firm to be respected if you are on the outside of the political playground."
"164","flat career path
salary rise is in small amounts

"165","The management is childish and completely biased. I had absolute zero career advancement and was more qualified than other employees they promoted to manager position. To the point that I was showing them how to do their job. My director isolated me from any career path."
"166","Increasingly top-down and top heavy in terms of senior non-reporting news positions. Pay gap between journalists and management growing"

"171","Slow moving large corporation
Focused on software as a means to data rather than software as a product"
"172","A LOT of nepotism - advancement can depend highly on who likes you, whether you speak up or remain quiet when issues arise, and in some cases your sex and/or appearance."
"173","There is a strong push to move technical and editorial jobs overseas.  The company does not ""shoot-straight"" with its employees.  Instead they create euphemisms for off-shoring work (BPI) and keep employees at bay by emphasizing that we are a global company (READ: don't complain, we can find 10 people in india to do your job for you). Layoffs happen by having people ""disappear"" a few handfuls at a time with no open... or honest discussion about the criteria.  They claim their death-march projects are ""agile"" but then force agile team members to work overtime."
"174","Recently managers just make decision without considering whether it's fair and appropriate to their employees."
"175","Lay offs.  Pay is low."

"177","a large multinational company, bureaucracy, slow to react, no green field approach, mediocre compensation, financial industry dependent, not much new, no the brightest colleagus"
"178","Upper Management flippant with commitment to staff - many who have been employed for over 5 years have at least one story of a group being dissolved or threatened to be."
"179","Dont go here if your looking for a career, unless of course you aspire to work in India for a fraction of the pay.  Many jobs already moved to India and many more will be moving in the next few months.  Great way to support the American workfoce!"
"180","You're stuck in a division. Not much opportunity to change roles without taking on risk to your career. No real career path definition, or assistance in helping you in that area. I've noticed that almost every senior manager...well looks like a senior manager. Tall, attractive, corporate looking."
"181","If you go to work in the Finance organization, be very careful which Finance group you will be working in.  There are many Finance groups within the West organization and while most are good groups to work in, some are not.  Be somewhat wary if you are interviewing for a vacant position that internal candidates do not seem to be interested in as there is likely a good reason for this.  It is well know within the... company that some Finance positions are way overloaded with work load and these positions will offer nothing even close to a work-life balance.  You will frequently be working 10-12 hour days as well as nights and weekends and getting little or no compensation for this (i.e. comp time or even praise).  In most Finance groups, a Senior Financial Analyst will be working a more reasonable 40-50 hour work week.  So if you can avoid working in one of the ""bad"" Finance groups, you could be very happy there."
"182","They pay for most of the West Law related positions is terrible and there is little oppertunity for career advancement."
"183","Since the merger there has been a move towards globalisation which risks losing some of the unique qualities which have made sub-divisions world beaters in their areas."
"184","Offshoring (aka SELLING OUT).  I agree with another poster that TR has changed over the past ten years.  TR has a short-term vision of earning profits for shareholders rather than a long-term vision of satisfying customers, growing the organization and becoming a responsible, American organization.  TR is on the forefront of selling Americans soul for the benefit of the few and the demise of the many.  It's... interesting in how TR claims to be on the front lines of charity and helping others but yet their policies and hiring practices contribute to the weakness of our economy.  As a long time employee, Im embarrassed to work for Thomson as corporate responsibility has gone out the window.  Yes, we are now in a global economy but that does not mean we sell our country and our people out.  It's a shame.

Last (a sad note), many very strong and talented people were laid off recently from TR.  No reason was given but based on geography; it was prejudicial and done so to maximize executive profits."
"185","Get used to feeling like a small cog in a huge corporation with lots of politics."
"186","It is a place that I would find hard to recommend to somebody in London to join. Sadly belief in grand change progammes like offshoring made it a very difficult place to get things done."
"187","While Thomson is an industry leader in many areas yet they are still learning how to effectively manage so many clients."
"188","Limited options to expand and grow. Getting promotion is difficult. Moving from one proj to other is very difficult. N/A"
"189","To get promoted you have to jump through hoops and a lot of times people who absolutely don't deserve it end up getting the position. Not a lot of career growth"
"190","The compensations is not great if you have spent 10 years in the company even if your career has progress well in terms of responsibilities and promotions and you are a constant achiever in the top 10% in end of the year performance reviews. The disappointing thing about Thomson Reuters is that you often end up having to accomodate a lot of people that don't really do anything useful apart from add bureaucracy for... the sake of looking like they are involved and doing something."
"191","Large corporate environment. Lack of creativity and nimbleness at times."
"192","As a Software Engineer, we were far from users. Specifications were coming from Financial Engineer or Support Analyst so it was hard to understand end users needs."
"193","Absolute dead end job.

working hard is a crime.

If  you work here for 2-3 years you will forget what is known as working hard you will be in your own comfort zone.

No proper training or any training managers.

Make the bgp(Business Graduates from top notch universities- unfortunately with very little market knowledge) contribute more to the organization and department or else its a honeymoon period for... them or hire some one from a less reputated university who really wants to work hard and make name for himself."
"194","Very little opportunity for advancement.  Management can be aloof in non-HR matters - I think I received feedback once ever on my quality of work.  As long as we were doing our job in a measurable way, we were basically left alone and had to guess whether or not we were doing a good job."
"195","A stated intention to move as much development work to less expensive cost centers (mostly Bangalore) is being implemented.  Layoffs have already commenced.  

Engineers are given much latitude in implementing their own projects, but very limited view into larger architecture and integration issues.  Seriously, a good 50% of developers have no idea how their code is used. The ratio of architects and project... managers to implementing engineers is way too high.  This lead to a lot of design by consensus, resulting bloated, poorly performing software applications.  These applications are composed of some very sophisticated, well designed and built components.  But the final results some ugly, poorly performing applications that don't add a lot of value for customers.  

Flat structure makes advancement difficult.  The only way to get ahead (and I've managed to accomplish this to some extent) is to try to call attention to your own silo of work.  Never try to contribute in the larger picture! You will only piss people off, because they think you are encroaching on their territory. 

There is a serious problem with integrating Thomson and Reuters cultures.  Everybody is aware of it, but nobody says it out loud.  This is a direct result of the turf protecting ethos that pervades."

"204","The downsides of working at Thomson Reuters include having to be billable and making sure to meet the goals of billable hours"

Health Insurance really sucks.
Low Compensation, no salary hikes for almost 3 years in a row now.
Management is bound on ousourcing jobs and believes this will solve every problem.
Frequest Layoffs is certainly no... motivation."
"211","Low pay.  Not enough opportunity to move up within the organization. Too much office politics.  Negative outlook on future due to layoffs, outsourcing jobs, salary changes, low to no raises..."
"212","Thomson Reuters is an extremely flat workplace.  While it is good if you are there for a paycheck and/or a second income, don't expect to advance from the ground up.  Most senior level appointments are made from outside the company.  Management level positions are difficult to attain even if you consistently exceed expectations."
"213","After the TR merger, the company has still not gotten their internal processes in order. The internal computer systems are not integrated and therefore require a lot of unnecessary manual work. The amount of documentation they like people to do is out of control. Some people are wayy too sensitive here - its business, get over it, its nothing personal."

- Non-existent Human Resources
- People who have remained in this company are usually the... ones that have become complacent or are unqualified to find other opportunities. (Great if you like surfing the net and accomplishing almost nothing all day.)

Management thinking - only few employees work and because of which there department runs.

They lack management and communication skills.
Performance review is done solely to bring the morale down of the employee.
Too much expectation to perform at 1-2 level above that there current position."
"228","While pay is similar to other companies for some people, it's not for others. I know of people who ultimately left for this reason.

As someone working at the ""individual contributor"" rather than managerial level, I don't feel valued. 

As far as I can tell, there's no way to advance my career without moving into management. It's possible that career opportunities exist, but none of my managers have time to... discuss it with me. 

I attend a lot of conferences (during non-work hours) where I learn about better ways to do my job, but I'm not allowed time to try these ideas out, and when I suggest them to my manager, I receive no response. 

I know more than one person who has left the company for reasons like these, and hiring managers seem completely unfazed by it. Instead of trying to fix the problem, they just open up a new req, which I suppose just means that they don't consider it to be a problem.

Communication is lacking. The weird part about this, is that it seems like senior management has heard this message over the past few years, and instead of fixing it by understanding what sort of communication is lacking, has instead ""fixed"" the problem by producing more of what I'd call internal spam--telling us about volunteer work someone has done in some office in some other country and such. That's not the communication I'm looking for. Instead, I want to hear about things like what's going on in the business unit I work for. What are our financial targets? Are they realistic? Are we on track to meet them? If not, what are we going to do to fix that? (And I don't want to just hear the marketing hype, I want to hear what we're _really_ going to do.) I feel like I get more information through the rumour mill about what the team I belong to is doing than from the team's ""leadership."""
"229","Big and sometimes change can take time with any large company."
"230","Depands on the position, many might be a dead-end within the company. To the most part, when people are ready to move on, they move to a different company."
"231","Where do I begin, there are no managers here...only people who have been promoted based on who they know.  Most of these people only have high school diplomas.  What kind of company asks for a 4 yr degree for all associates then promote all the ones that made it in the door without one.  Clients are getting frustrated because of all of the different associates on their accounts.  Clients are passed around like... playing cards. There is no room for growth within this company.  Little to no career direction or career planning.  There is no upward mobility for associates just lateral moves like a game of musical chairs.  There is no formal training for new associates, they are hired and then bombarded with work and then chastised when mistakes are made.  This is a company for you if you like being stagnate and being complacent in your day to day job.  There is no job enrichment, job enlargment or job rotation.  Performance reviews are thrown at you as the golden ticket, but you arent rewarded if you do a good job so whats the point.  Our little to nonexistent pay raises are 3%, and thats on a good year.  Jobs are constantly being outsourced to third world countries when our economy is in the worst shape ever.  Way to go Thomson Reuters, way to add to the national unemployment rate.  There are townhall meetings about the greatness of the company and how well the company is performing, yet in still no pay raises this year and entire departments were shipped to India.  Not to beat up on the people of India, but we correct more mistakes due to them than any other source.  You get what you pay for.  I would not recommend this company to anyone that wants a career that is upward mobile."
"232","Low pay to start. Raises are usually 3% or less and depend on pool allocated by management, not individual performance. Not much room for advancement. Employees usually just quit, transfer into lateral position in another department, or stagnate until they retire. Jobs are increasingly being outsourced to India and the Philippines."
"233","They don't know who is working extremely hard and who is slacking. Promote based on how well you kiss the bosses a** and not performance. Criticize people often, but never give out compliments."

"235","Middle and senior management positions are a different ball game. Office politics and aggression are abundant within in the company - . There are several  office bullies within the senior management group that regularly pick on unsuspecting middle management colleagues - usually instigating ""dress downs"" in the large public open plan office space. This is so unprofessional to see or experience. 
The London office... is controlled by the Philadelphia office in the US and from what I encountered was a very ""Silo"" type of management in it's internal strategies and in selling the company offerings to Pharma / Bio companies.
The HR dept has a career development plan in place but it's just another program that is over controlled by senior management - Staff are dissatisfied with the end results.
Seems more like a regimented group of senior managers/directors that just throw their weight about without listening to logic or good proposals.
Business operations are to slow due to inefficient and antiquated IT infrastructure. To many out dated IT systems for billing clients and processing orders.
Time management is not good under such poor IT infrastructures and Siloed processes.
Far to many products to sell to clients.
Sales teams are constantly being re-structured to cope with the vast array of products - playing catch up but never quiet getting there.
To many discounts given to clients.

So if you want something done, you often get a response that is the equivalent of ""that is not my job"". Also, the place reeks of mediocrity; nobody is particularly intelligent."
"237","There are not too many opportunities to develop yourself, no way of getting senior roles or team leader positions without connections. the job itself is boring-if you work in Data Team then you update the database which doesn't require much effort of thinking.The products are complicated and user-unfriendly, hence lots of client's complaints."
"238","At minimum, large re-orgs seem to occur every two years.  Layoffs go along with those re-orgs.  Many positions moved off shore to India and Manila.  This trend will likely continue.

Learn what you can here, but make sure to keep your skils current and are flexible enough to take care of yourself if need be."
"239","- Vision of Top Management is cleared but many people in junior management level are not professional enough. Someone was promoted not by his capability but familiarity.
- If you are working in a development center there is almost no way to grow up unless you are relocated to the headquarter or a regional bureau."
"240","Top management has been a reolving door. The original founders are long gone.  The objectives of this division are miniscule in light of the parent company goals.  The small things that  make employees feel good are ignored.  Job security is a myth in any company but employees here live in fear that their jobs are on the line."
"241","can be a little boring during the slow months. bad and a good thing :)"
"242","- TR's culture is rich and lazy.  The company makes too much money too easily for people to remain hungry and competitive.
- TR is so big and slow to change, it misses the market opportunities by 2 to 5 years.  After a small, hungry competitor has proved a market, TR goes into it and struggles for 3 to 5 years to catch up.
- So many processes internally are mismanaged that you have to be ready for disfunctional... relationships, ""big company craziness"" and people who keep saying, year after year after year, that ""things are going to get better"" and they never do...
- Products are often behind the market in capability and innovation.
- Industry leading products are always on the drawing board, but are literally YEARS late in being delivered by product management.
- The culture is VERY hierarchical. People ""wear their stripes on their sleeves"" and believe that ""having the title"" is as important as ""being right"", when it's not.  WRONG is WRONG, no matter what your title."
"243","Don't pay attorneys what they're worth. At all."
"244","Economic woes have led to more cuts of staff and reduction in spending for basics (no extra coffee cups or drinking cups for guests).  As you move up in the ranks, opportunities for growth are limited as they are way too top heavy.  Senior management swings from excellent in some divisions to very weak in others.  Politics in the financial side of the business is driving down morale and employee satisfaction."

"247","Lots of downsides.  Working 40 hour weekends on call, and then get someone who grumbles when you abashedly ask for comp time, which ends up being just a few hours one day during the week.  A team lead just joined the group who's a 40 year old high school jock (that's got to be the worst for me).  Favoritism all over the place.  I quite frequently feel expendable, especially with the waves of India replacements.  Buy... America - are you kidding?  These guys are told to buy India support, and people and groups are being slashed all the time to make way for the new Thomson-India-IT (goole and you'll see the numbers).  This meeting obsession has got to be higher here than any other environment Ive work for in the past, the meeting thing here is so irritating I couldn't put my diatribes on a 5 GB DVD much less put it in this little blurb.  

I dread to come in every morning, wish I could work somewhere else, I feel like Im trapped in a place I begrudgingly have to go to, even the front guards are Minnesota-mean before you walk in the front door.  Still, there are lots of nice people here, you just have to weed through the management lot, theyre the anomaly.  Top down way of thinking, input is rarely received, I almost feel they tolerate what you have to say, and rather you not speak at all.  

In a nutshell Id not recommend the place, if you get two potential opportunities look closely at the other one.  Pay attention to the aggregate negative feedback you see here, look for the common complaints, if you decided to work here, itll be an echo to you later on."
"248","Marketing is nonexistent, business plans change from month to month.  Company has decided to ""streamline"" by laying off 140 US employees and building and equipping two overseas offices, flying employees to the US to be trained by those they will be replacing, and hiring over 200 new overseas employees.  Raising prices every year is not a marketing plan nor a way to drive sales.

Constantly be reorganized with no real solution. Somewhat outdated backend systems"
"250","Low pay. Not enough opportunity to move up within the organization. Negative outlook on future due to layoffs, outsourcing jobs, salary changes, low to no raises.

Outsourced centers in Bangalore, Phillipines have no technical knowledge, no troubleshooting skills and low English skills... which makes communication between teams difficult and frustrating."
"251","Ton of middle management, basically like a giant govt. bureacracy that is outsourcing every possible task to Manila and Hyderabad but the new locations are not considered outsourced jobs because they are ""colleagues"" now. Made a profit during a recession (2009) and still axed 100 jobs in my department.

Hierarchy in editorial is disorganised & communication between departments very poor.  Our market data is horrible, so many areas where it's incomplete or just plain wrong.  Massive backlog (years) for new data and enhancements.  Other departments... being slashed or moved to Poland, Portugal, India, Manila, etc."

"289","The place is a cash cow for businesses that were successful before and the founders wanted to sell out to Thomson family who buy everything up since they can't create anything of real value themselves. 

The talented people in those companies leave once their employment contracts are over. They take brains and energy with them. They are usually pretty miserable by then. 

The tech platforms are a mess,... integration is a mess, and clients only use their stuff because they are monopolies for certain kinds of historic data which is too costly and time consuming now to recreate. They are not delivering the cutting edge, and for big players they are cheaper than Bloomberg that's why they're there for 10,000s of lower level financial personnel. 

It will always be difficult for them with this cash cow portfolio strategy. On the sellside, they will bounce around competing with Bloomberg in good times and and taking real hits in bad. They will always be the lower cost alternative for large client sites who are demanding and penny pinching. Even on the sellside, quality of support to brokers and advisors is becoming a joke as there are so many on the streets. Now they own Reuters too to ease whatever competition there was. For the buyside, they need the historical data which is now a commodity, but they have a strong link there. The buyside add their own proprietary value with their models, so only need data, no analytics of any note. 

Meanwhile, the industry suffers from lack of competition and lack of technology innovation which can deliver this data at much lower costs than with the BBG, Thomson/Reuters paradigm still firmly in place and still held together by COBOL and FORTRAN. Anti-trust department should look into this because data costs and inefficiencies hit everybody in the hidden fees for mutual funds and 401K plans, which are passed through to the end investor."

There are a few people in power positions here who are rude, nasty tyrants. The ones who get promoted are the ones who are ""BFF's"" with the higher ups. So those who work hard and rightfully deserve a promotion will never get one. There is a ton of favoritism in this... company. The raises are minuscule. Different supervisors often make completely different rules to follow under the very same manager, leading to employees feeling very mistreated. There is no flexibility in your schedule at any time during the week before the 20th of each month if you work in Client Services. The company is set back in the olden days and only allows telecommuting in very rare circumstance. Employees are often treated like children. Micromanagement runs rampant across the entire company. The office environment is horrible. I have seen/heard more verbal (almost physical) FIGHTS between employees/supervisors/managers than I could ever possibly imagine. The software we use is archaic. The office furniture is brutally uncomfortable. The town hall meetings are a huge waste of time. Management is actually tasked with looking around and writing down employee's names who fall asleep during the meeting. Office activities are canceled due to lack of participation. The company does nothing for devastating floods that hit the Atlanta area (including employees' homes) in 2009, but will collect money to donate to other countries for their disasters. Thomson Reuters has laid off many employees and sent their jobs overseas. More and more jobs are being sent over there every day. But then the work comes back to us for us to fix all the mistakes they make while management blames us as the reason for the mistake. Just about all employees fear for the loss of their job.

Maybe it is because of the rush, but in many areas there is a lack of collaboration and some are outright rude.  Instead of taking the time to do it right - you hear, ""I don't have time for this...just do it.""  It blows me away how... inefficient and wasteful they are with resources in the interests of haste.  If time is taken on the front end, it is more efficient and there is less waste.  You can say goodbye to home life.  Working weekends and nights...60 hour weeks...not my cup of tea.  Overtime should be a rarity, not the standard."

- pay is not... that competitive
- bonuses are rather small, but what can you expect - this isnt goldman"

"376","no rewards in terms of promotion if you are based in high cost countries"
"377","Big companies can find it hard to accept and act on the challenges that arise when small new things start to become the big new thing. The impact of the Internet, the impact of social networks, the impact of consumerisation of everything. There can be a bit too much process, a bit too many meetings, too much agreement, not enough ""raw"" leadership. If you are too quite, even if effective, you may sink. If you are... boistrous, effective, but annoying, you may sink too. Sometimes I see a little bit too much ""yes boss"", upward management, etc. but I'm sure it's no worse elsewhere."
"378","Frequent reorganizations can hurt relationships with clients."
"379","Salary usually is below market average"
"380","1) Extra benefits like yearly bonus not available, allowances very little or restricted.
2) Very hard or virtually no possibility to move across divisions in India atleast ( AFAIK), one of the most important drawbacks of working here.
3) Work can be monotonous after sometime, but will learn new things although in a very far streched pace.
4) Shifts can be hazardous to health and take a toll at times if working... for long hours, a common phenomenon though when night shifts occur.This is again only in concern with India."
"381","Like many companies, Thomson Reuters likes to cut staff to the bone until real damage is done, then it performs yet another reorg.  Round and round we go.  Way too political.  Customers and shareholders suffer because of internal turf wars."

My supervisor and manager were working even longer hours and brought work home with them at night.
- my supervisor was not good at delegating, I found myself having to continuously ask for what I should be... doing next, didn't have a set of responsibilities
- I did not find it to be the most friendly working environment, even in my small department there wasn't much camaraderie."

Salaries for the freshers could be more lucrative."
"388","- Low financial compensation
- Little opportunity for advancement. Just a lot of shuffling at the same level to broaden experience sets

"408","drive. Reuters may not necessarily have the same investment banking hunger and determination that comes with your brand name IB banks but I guess it also doesn't have the stress factor as well."
"409","The tough economic climate for financial information businesses and the decreasing unit value of raw data over the past decade forced Reuters to almost 'run on empty' for a few years.  The acquisition by Thomson provided some financial stability - particularly the wider market focus into Legal, Scientific, Tax and other information areas.  The downside is that old Reuters culture has been lost to some extent.... However, if you didn't know the 'old world' it might not be an issue."
"410","Large company in the middle of restructure"
"411","Short-term ""strategy"" that leaves everyone wondering what their goals really are. Not much opportunity, and no recognition for the amount of work expected."
"412","Wokring at Thomson Reuters is a lot like working at Initech, the company in the movie Office Space. It's terrible. It drains all your motivation to get out of bed in the morning. Middle management is off the wall and has double standards. If there's no work to be done, they'll yell at you, even if you sent them an email the day before asking for work."
"413","* Sometimes overly process oriented (seems to be changing for the better slowly)

"418","The salary compared with some of the other companies based in the twin cities could be improved. Many people leave West to work at places like Honeywell or Target and take on comparable jobs with a significant pay increase. More and more benefits are being taken away and given the current economic climate, employees do not feel as secure in their employment. Since the acquisition of Reuters, there have been annual... lay-offs; something that was unheard of prior to the transaction."
"419","Speed of change for some can be unsettling with the number of acquisitions that take place.  The culture is to gain the best from employees so there is a high expectation to deliver above and beyond your standard job profile."
"420","1.  Promotes people based on who you know and not based on his or his abilities.
2.  Almost nothing to zero budget for training. Especially in this environment when technology (mobile platforms) and products are changing fast, training is very important and lack of emphasis on training is a poor reflection of management's outlook on HR development.
3.  Poor to unqualified Managers on the technology side (extremely... poor and lacking strategic and basic management skillset).
4.  Trying to play catch up to Bloomberg and Bloomberg on the other hand en-roaching its territories (Professional, Analytics, Westlaw, etc.)

These drawbacks of the company tend to increase with your seniority. In a senior sales position the majority of your time negotiating a deal will be making sense of internal pricelists, CRM... systems and trying to understand competing fractions of the company. Many sales experts/product owners are actually more interested in meeting with the customers and just talking rather than selling."
"455","Lack of career progression opportunities"
"456","Pay is on the lower end of the scale, and promotions are hard to come by and can be as much about luck as skill.  Annual bonuses are a given and do not reflect your performance.  Performance-based bonuses are so random as to actually be cruel.  Re-organizations are very common, meaning all the time you spent showing your boss how hard you work and what you get done may mean little weeks later when a new manager... controls your salary increase.

People are demotivated in general. Not doing their work is not met with any action during the reviews. Employees just come in, talk on the... phone the whole day and spend hours on Facebook and twitter. Even worse, some softies check in buggy code and make life hell for the guys who actually do the work.
Management treats software engineers as replaceable entities and does not respect them enough - I personally knew a business lead who threw tantrums and treated a dev on my team like crap. Management in general does not seem to know what to do with all the useless projects lying around and decides the best thing to do is shift resources.
Review process is a joke. Managers take it very lightly. Micromanagement is not uncommon."
"494","It's getting comical how under market people are being paid for my position.
The review and promotion structure is bureaucratic through and through.  More non-management people are realizing that there are team quotas stopping them from getting proper reviews.

attitude of ""who you know"" not ""what you"" know is prevalent.
poor compensation.
no career advancement or job security in some departments, trend is towards outsourcing jobs overseas.
Some departments operate very unethically towards employees, HR supports management, not the employee."
"540","very less growth opportunities. If u can say ok for everything to your immediate manager, u can grow."
"541","In some areas, the politics is horrible.  Senior management direction changes every 6 months.  You are asked to make things happen without proper resources or full support."
"542","not treating people according to the performance"
"543","not easy to get promotion and they always prefer to get people outside company for higher position rather than promoting the existing staff."
"544","salary level doesn't correspond the level of responsibility  - high responsibility vs low salary"
"545","Only ""yes men"" are rewarded, so process improvement is impossible.  This is exacerbated by their history of acquisitions and repetitive operational restructuring. Managers lack technical competence on all levels. Mission states they ""value clients needs as much as their own"" while they actually laugh at the precarious positions they put their clients in by service delivery failures.  Most poorly run large company... imaginable.  Whether they will ultimately implode is not the question, but when?  And how they have avoided it so far?? Not a place for a serious professional."
"546","several - pay, growth, work life balance"
"547","it is an old boys network, promotions are not based on results, poor performers are rewarded where achievers arent. Business isn't growing so they are continually cutting in order to achieve same results"
"548","Sometimes, interns are neglected so you need to be okay with not doing work."
"549","Same cons as many other companies, in the current climate we are trying to do more with less which can lead to high expectations with limited resource and some long working hours."
"550","Compensation is lower compared to other technology companies. The company recognition is quite low outside of the professions that use their products. The hierarchy is typical of most large corporations that stifle creativity."
"551","Low morale due to lay-offs"
"552","The organization was very flat and it was difficult to advance."
"553","Although colleagues are friendly there is many of them who stayed with the company for a long time and seem to not care about the job anymore. It is difficult to work with them as a team sometimes and achieve significant progress. Another thing is lack of transparency and communication from the higher management on significant projects."
"554","Micro management, top down decision without understanding real issues locally"
"555","No respect for employees, bonus and raises is non existent, Senior management seems to be hell bent on driving the business in to the ground. lack of investment in technology and building skill sets. Zero scope for personal and professional growth."

"563","Management is detached from the organization
Management is focused on numbers and not the people
Ultimately this is a family run business not sure how committed the family is to the business as they tend to buy and sell different businesses over time
Disconnect between rewards and performance
No real energy or focus - lot's going on but no feeling of working for one organization"
"564","The company tends to focus on the top-line without much regard for the bottom line. Downsizing decisions were not well thought-out and clientele were lost to other vendors because of it."
"565","The company is offshoring quite a bit of its technical/development work, and is apparently ""in-shoring"" (i.e., replacing experienced permanent employees with VISA-holding contractors) the remainder of the work slated to stay in the US.  The key driver no longer quality but cost-cutting."
"566","Mexico City's office doesn't have a lot of international projection, and senior management is really poor. All power in LATAM is in Brazil."
"567","Market data has become a commodity - the profits that were reaped in the 90s are not there any more now that real-time market data is available over the Internet for free."
"568","Senior Management direction is questionable, Salary rangers, lateral promotions"
"569","They get awards for family-friendliness, but it really depends on your manager. My manager declared that you could either spend time with your family, or you could put in longer hours at work and get promoted and feed your family. No lie. Said manager also said that employees should not be given extra training, as everyone was 'too dumb' to understand advanced concepts for promotion. Yet, this guy was the apple of... senior management's eye."
"570","Lackluster mid level leadership
Company is heavily focusing on the bottom line
salary is below market
leadership tends to manage up and not down"
"571","Salaries not adequate with market margins.  Sr Management moves depts offshore often without thinking of the repercussions and then moves them back or to another country.  Thomson Reuters offers tuition reimbursement, but no reimbursement for certificate training such as Cisco, PeopleSoft or Salesforce.com certifications."
"572","I freelanced there for several years and would have loved the opportunity to move from contractor to employee, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem like many slots open up."
"573","Encouragement to work abroad was lacking at the time."
"574","Lots of pressure to meet business demands"
"575","The company does not operate as a single organization.   As a result, it is difficult for employees to move within the company, to understand the other businesses or partner with other peers."
"576","Below par in comparison to other financial institutions
Too departmentalised
Poor communication between teams
Poor sharing between teams
Too many middle managers
Some people too set in their ways and haven't embraced the merger of Thomson and Reuters (an obvious 'them and us culture')"
"577","Lousy pay. Senior management lacks direction and clarity. Good execution not in the company's DNA. A frustrate place to work if you want to make a difference. Hong kong office doesn't provide desk to sales, only hot desk."

No investment in product
Unethical practice from top management
Poor understanding of the business"
"579","Growth opportunities past the manager level is difficult. Salaries can be better."
"580","fast-paced, not a lot of upward feedback to management happens, personnel decisions happen slowly, it's cold in minnesota, lots of collaboration with colleagues in Asia which causes some odd hours and strains communication."
"581","minimal feedback and incentives to perform well, can be long and boring"
"582","The company very large and complex, and makes it hard for itself to operate more successfully. One one hand, there is a constant paranoia with Bloomberg and on the other hand an obsession with internal re-structuring."
"583","With the organisation being such an immense size it is difficult to understand all the activities across the entire organisation."
"584","Management is all over the place and firmly rooted in the US. Pay is benchmarked against the 50th centile  and for a long time pay reviews have been stagnant because of weak performance."
"585","disruptive organizational changes by management
poor support of sales team
unequal pay structure for employees, poor commission structure"
"586","Very old boys club
Layoffs done by job, not by performance - you could work really hard and get let go just because they can justify eliminating your position.  So some people stay forever and hardly work and others work really hard and still get let go.  Very de-motivating."
"587","Low merit increases regardless of performance, long hours (50-60/wk),  not enough resources to deal with workload, no pay for performance even though company claims that is their priority."
"588","Business constantly being restructured, priorities change constantly, team i worked on was constantly embattled"
"589","You are typically allowed to do your job with minimal interference, however advancement is decidedly a political game."
"590","More and more professional jobs are off-shored to India"
"591","A lot of offices are closing in higher income countries and moving to lower income countries in Asia. This makes working as an analyst more difficult in terms of dealing with queries. Geographic separation between analysts and managers also makes it difficult to have your work noticed."
"592","not a very strong corporate culture, I feel like Thomson Reuters has a potential to make their culture more concrete and that they can do a lot more to make their employees happy and have fun when they comet o work. Sometimes Thomson Reuters can feel like a maze of cubes"
"593","Communication is difficult and sometimes ill-timed; top-down decision making; some empowerment is supported but not across the organization (not embedded in the culture)"
"594","Due to relocation and transition period many experienced peole left the company because of a bad management and lack of appreciation. The company desgard the time and effort invested in his employees' learning process and can easily get rid of experienced people."
"595","There are many cons with workiing at Thomson West right now, primarily job security. On the sales side of things there tend to be corporate restructuring and down sizing at least once a year. The comp plans are  constantly changed, and not in a positive direction. The general way to motivate employees right now tends to be through fear with very little positive feedback."
"596","Because Thomson Reuters is public, senior leadership has to tap dance to a board. Because it is big, working with remote teams can be tiring."
"597","Career opportunities and advancement at Thomson Reuters are limited and run out fast. Achievements are not adequately rewarded with compensation or advancement."
"598","Senior Leaders mindset was very outdated.  Did not care or value employees.  Communicaiton or involvement of employee feedback was minimal.  Senior leaders were long term employees but operated on the good ole boy network."
"599","Management is a joke! If you do a really good job they will trap you in that position forever because they are too lazy to train and hire a replacement. Extremely unfair when it comes to promoting within, get ready to fake laugh at stupid jokes and buy Starbucks for your ""Maybe"" future boss.
 The pay is a lot lower then the industry average."
"600","low morale, inconsistent practices, limited knowledgeable management, unfair practices, limited growth opportunity"
"601","Biggest con is the organizational structure. It was very hard to determine who reported to who at times and where to go for resources. Currently working on simplification - but a lot still needs to be done."
"602","Dissatisfied with the way cultivating leadership from within is almost nonexistent in certain groups.  Mentoring opportunities are not provided by upper management."
"603","Silos, constant reorganization, management top heavy with constant threat of outsourcing jobs to India or Eastern Europe. Disjointed reward system unfairly rewards senior staff. There seems to be no option if your personal manager is hopeless."
"604","Low salary at the beginning, sometimes team leaders are blocking the development not letting to take part in projects and courses."
"605","1.  Hectic schedule mostly due to project planning
2.  Work from home option expects your availabilty 24X7.
3. Indian managers are just the puppets to their US counterparts.
4. No formal process followed for project implementation,appraisal,reviews.
5. Bad lobby of old employees.
6. Old technologies used, your skills might get outdated in couple of years.
7. Lack of technical expertise."

"607","Very less salary Survive to in Bangalore for an individual. Growth in this company is very slow comparing to other companies."
"608","Thomson Reuters is a big company.  Certain seemingly easy administrative updates happen much slower than you could possibly imagine.  It doesn't quite feel like a startup."
"609","As a Content company, only few teams can give the opportunity to employees who aspire to grow technically."
"610","Mind-numbing banal work (inserting thousands of footnotes a week into books), attorneys treated with contempt, have to report to supervisors who are not lawyers - some with no college degree. Senior management on site possibly insane."
"611","Lack of innovations. No passionate stakeholders around."
"612","IT organization is not sorted"
"613","Below average salary.

"622","constant turnover in leadership at the department and business unit level made it difficult to reap any benefits after ""paying your dues"
"623","Not a place for people who come looking for onsite opportunities to begin with in their careers. Otherwise its a good place to be."
"624","over-worked load pressure and very unstable work-off schedule;"
"625","I think Thomson was a great company but the Reuters Acquisition created a deficit of morale in the long run. The pain is still being felt and the economies of scale are  not driving revenue. In many case the upper management has filtered down into company as a reverse takeover Reuters CEO took over after buyout."
"626","Pay is low.  No reward for attainment of degrees, certificates, etc.  No support for training or continuing ed.  Healthcare premiums are high and increase >10% annually.  Performance doesn't matter.  Exceeding your annual objectives will award you less than 1%.  Yes, LESS than ONE percent.  That's a fraction of a percent.  Ie, the numbers come after the decimal, to the right of it, not before.  Culture is not as... good as it could be. There is no cafereria or sitting area."
"627","Low pay; Hard to get promoted; Almost no bonuses; Hardly any pay increase."

too much political patronage
really hard to move between divisions and units
too ready to cut talent loose rather than move to other units"
"634","Senior management had little idea of what the work actually entailed; tendency to over engineer any automated system so becomes unwieldy; several wrong strategies followed resulting in redundancies; pay is definitely NOT commensurate with elsewhere"
"635","Social life in the country is poor"
"636","My manager is too strong and always want to control everything"
"637","As an intern, you have to work 60+ hours a week and take non stop calls. It is an incredibly stressful job.  There is a lot to learn.  You must learn basic tax law, systems, and the tax software.  Selection of full time candidates is not based on performance.   Workload is not worth the pay.  Because the workload is so high, coworkers are much more likely to get a little testy."
"638","Only focused on cost cutting, which is constant - layoffs, layoffs, layoffs for US staff
Poor career path for US based employees
Poor pay raises and limited differentiation for high performers (1% versus .05% raises)
No raises for promotions 
Constant reorgs - used to cover Senior Management's poor performance and poor leadership
Double standards between sr mgt and rest of firm (compensation, travel, spending,... golden parachutes)"

"640","Company is too big to communicate around, facing client and staff is always virtual through computer, take more time and effort to build a strong personal relationship with others."

"642","pay isn't fantastic although it's not bad.  it is a huge place to work so you start to feel like a number"
"643","The company has failed to deliver after the merger, when the top management has been completely disconnected and living in its bubble for many years. Strategy and priorities have been revisited every six months, creating chaos and demotivating the best elements."
"644","Be careful what you say.  Mangement may retaliate on personal grudge. It's a very political environment in some groups. There is no mutual trust to staff.  Some people have already lost drive to success.   
Technology is old and need update to be compatible with the rest of the world."
"645","the employee salaries are below market average for information technology. nothing particularly sexy or interesting about the company's products. it's just a job."
"646","They do not push for higher salaries for their temp employees. They did keep us in the look in regards to our end date."
"647","There are too many middle managers who are slowing the pace of innovation and are clouding the company's mission statement. Thomson Reuters' values of clarity and agility are not always obvious on a day-to-day basis. Opportunities fo advancement are not always clear. Frequent reorganizations make it sometimes difficult to remain focused."
"648","Constant reorgs, poor stock performance, infighting amongst senior management, a failure for a common culture to emerge, low morale in the Markets Division, constant layoffs, inability to follow through - these things may not be universal in the company but they certainly typify my experience in the Markets Division. Globalization has taken a huge bite out of US and UK workforce and I expect that to continue."

"657","The level of technology for employees and for what we sell to clients is not high. I thought the merger with Thomson would raise the level of Reuters technology both internally and for our products, but so far I don't see much evidence of that. This will make it difficult to compete."

"662","Management is turning Eagan from the HQ of legal to a ""site.""  Purchase of Reuters and subsequent failure of Eikon (rumored to be up to $1B in spend) has driven the org down dramatically and Sr. Mgmt's response is to cut support and services, diminishing client satisfaction, which has large negative effects on retention and pricing power.

-  extremely low-technology company working in a high tech financial world. Seriously.  Everything is so old and they are so penny pinching.
-  If you are looking for training or reward for a project well done or anything like that, you can... forget about it.  May be they would give you a $100 gift coupon for a project well done, if you are lucky.
- Many of the senior level folks waste lot of money on unnecessary projects that don't serve the strategic purposes.
- I have said this before.  Many of the senior level managers lack basic business skills (strategic thinking, financial acumen, etc.) as well as knowledge in current technological trends."
"676","Senior management has serious problems. The pay is low compared to other large companies. Training is only offered to new staff."

I work onsite, use company supplies, and am required to work specified hours, yet I am considered an ""independent contractor."" The company misclassifies some of its workers, in violation of IRS guidelines, in order to save money on benefits. Per... the IRS, a true independant contractor has multiple clients, exercises control over how their work is performed, uses their own tools, and is not required to work set hours. Basically, an independent contractor is a plumber or electrician who has their own business, not a full-time office worker.

Not getting paid benefits is bad enough, yet the way I am treated at work is difficult not to take personally. I sit one row over from the team I work with, yet my boss goes months without stopping by to check in on me and the other ""independent contractor,"" and we are excluded from the periodic team events such as birthday celebrations and holiday parties. They celebrate birthdays one row over from us, yet we are required to sit at our desks and continue working while everyone else eats cake and socializes. On a Friday in December, all the other workers besides the two ""contractors"" left the office for an entire afternoon to go to a restaurant for the holiday party.

Budgets can take months to get approved, by people who do not understand what your department does. Mid-level managers must ask for more copy paper. They cannot just order or buy some. It must be approved. That... can take a while.
 
Glocer, et... al stated they were happy with the merger with Reuters and everyone's job was ""safe"". I believe he stated ""You're not going anywhere!"" with a big smile.
About one year later, half of our office of several hundred were being laid off. Outsourced overseas.
They knew this would happen. Basically, lied to all of us.
 
At ThomsonReuters, quality is Job #2. Meeting some arbitrary profit number is Job #1.

Every single year I worked there, the ""economy"" or ""recession"" was cited as the reason for annual pay raises that averaged less than 1.5% for our entire 100+ employee division. Yes, even during my 2nd year when (again) we posted RECORD revenues and our 2nd best profits. Raises? Nah. The rumor was that the highest given was 2% and that was less than what was originally promised that employee. Again, bad economy... even though our profits were up.

People mysteriously disappear, better hope you don't get... saddled with a bad territory. We have all seen good sales reps be at the top of the pack get their territory changed and get walked out for not making the number.  They could be seasoned reps with more than 5 years or reps with 6 months under their belt, if you cant make you 3 month rolling average see ya! Doesn't matter how hard you work or how many hoops your jump through.  Someone needs to fix this department!

This might not be the case in all verticals of the company, but in mine, brown-nosing and bragging was the only way to get ahead. Management didn't know how to measure employee effectiveness."

After Merger in 2008, Still in process of building structured hierarchy at all levels."
"1120","I have seen the benefits decrease dramatically in the last several years.  I suppose this is partly due to the economic situation, but with no salary increase this year and health care benefits costing more with less coverage, a large percentage of employees have effectively taken a 5% paycut this year.  Little support for career growth from management.  New food service provider is not as good and more expensive."
"1121","Upper Management claims they want to merge the businesses together but that isn't happening. It's just red tape and lots of it.
Our salaries stink, benefits stink and increases are a joke. We receive excellent annual employee reviews and a minuscule increase. Why go the extra mile anymore?
I no longer refer excellent candidates to TR because I'm embarrassed for them to see how hard we work for so little money, a... tiny bonus and expensive healthcare benefits."

"1123","The pay was terrible, The Security management is to worried about saving their jobs by short cutting wages and raises to the front line worker.  The Security  management does not show any leadership and does not know how to communicate to it's own employees."
"1124","Lately, upper management within TR has been highly focused on ""cost cutting"" with a blind eye to the negative consequences of doing so. The most glaring example has been numerous benefit cuts over the last few months - poor health plan offerings for such a large company (not far off from what could be purchased privately for a healthy family), no more vacation carryover, much smaller raises in recent years than were... offered when I first joined the company. There is too much ""standardization"" going on; more successful parts or functions of the company are not allowed to offer better pay/benefits to remain competitive in the marketplace. It is ironic to receive two e-mails the same day, one from upper management describing the latest benefit cut, and another from lower level technology recruiting eager for ideas to help attract and retain quality technology employees. A few years ago, a decision was made to move a lot of development work to Bangalore, India. Fortunately, this was done without requiring a mass layoff of employees in Eagan, but I have noticed the work coming out of Bangalore is lower quality, and working on projects that require regular correspondence with India staff slows down progress on projects due to the time zone difference. Parking at the Eagan campus requires you to walk a long distance unless you are a higher level manager, visitor, or part of a carpool. There is no bump in granted vacation time between your 5th and 20th service anniversary, which seems too long.

I am guessing most software developers in the Twin Cities area could find options for a prospective employer that would provide a better pay/benefits package, still encourage the use of cutting edge technologies, and provide a better overall corporate atmosphere than Thomson Reuters. The local technology market is very hot right now, and recent corporate decisions are blind to this fact."
"1125","There is so much focus on the ""next"" product that the current ones are suffering through constant layoffs, lack of focus, and lethargic management.

Even though the company is doing poorly, they don't want to change the way they do things. They reward employees who are poor performers. The sales team gets iPads, trips and other bonuses even when they are not performing well. People are incredibly unfriendly and cliquey. ... There is no opportunity for growth here. Many of the senior level managers and executives have been here for a decade or more and they are completely out of touch with their employees and the market.  They take input on products or strategies because they think what they have been doing for the past 10 years is the right way, even though the industry has changed dramatically.  The managers I have come into contact with are the ultimate micro-managers, going so far as to monitoring who you socialize with.  It's dreadful."

India office only playing also rans rather than a... trendsetter. Lot of blaming Indian employees, back stabbing. Its very convenient to blame employees in India and get on with the status quo. Management does not take responsibility whatsoever. Only technical people are blamed for anything. Considerable politics at the office. Also, no diversity in hiring. HR was useless."

For example, a business unit head may have an ""open door, open email"" policy to encourage feedback, but employees would be rightfully reticent to expose themselves by making a suggestion.  So, I think there is a bit of cynicism toward the ""You can make a... difference"" message sent out by senior management.  In fact, I would say that all internal communications are read with a collective smirk by anyone who has been there any length of time."
"1156","Ever see a dying fish flop around in the bottom of a boat? That is Thomson Reuters. When Thomson bought Reuters it bought a dog that couldn't hunt for a premium price right when the financial sector was heading south. The synergies never emerged and the result is a large dysfunctional behemoth heavy on management layers that spends most it time redrawing org charts and not understanding why the org charts have... nothing to do with how things actually work -when they work. With poor financial performance the company has turned to cost cutting and layoffs to try and boost the bottom line.

When you have pay increases which have fallen far below the pace of inflation, increased work hours and an increased cost for health insurance, you tend to look  for other jobs. This is especially upsetting knowing our division has been very profitable despite the economic downturn.... The day-to-day operations with customers are typically handled without management's knowledge. This can go on for years and makes it difficult when evaluating employees. An employee can work with clients to achieve wonderful things, but no one else in the company may come to realize it.

There is a new trend to higher freshers at low... salaries and give them oppertunities, these freshers are free to behave any way they want to cos they r cheaper resources. To put in a nutshell there is no dignity and decency left in p3. There is bias wrt gender, age, looks and marital status. Constant harrassment for those who have no Godfather. Senior Management is just a puppet in the hands of managers who have formed their favorites. Sister of an existing AM got promoted to senior associate in one year only, cos her assignements Quality Check everything was taken care of. Its all about ass licking.

There are so many people in this company that don't seem to have any real function other than smiling and nodding in meetings.  SO. MANY. NONTECHNICAL. PEOPLE. IN. TECHNICAL. POSITIONS.

Their corporate cut-throat environment brings out the worst behavior in otherwise good people and magnifies the dark side of human nature.  Outsourcing for no other reason than to save a few dollars on salary and benefits to the detriment of their customers.  They treat their customers with no respect since they basically have a... monopoly on the legal information market.  High pressure sales tactics on their customers since they know there customers are ""married"" to their products and are forced to buy the latest flavor of the month garbage that Reuters is peddling."

- They are yet to... understand that they own a conglomerate of businesses and ride rough-shod over value and margins to deliver an integrated Bloomberg type desktop at any cost (not that the general objective is a bad idea)
- Highly politicised environment in financial services divisions due to people merely caretaking their products/revenues whie change moves on, but the pace of change (or its concreting) moves slower than people's ability to get scared or over promise. 
- Extreme levels of demotivation and depression widespread

"1307","It is like most large companies it is slightly understaffed in key groups.  The correct way to ask for something basic (e.g. a seat for a new hire) isn't made clear.  The career path is based on your relationships more then anything else...your review doesn't lead to much."

Too many businesses are relying on legacy to stay alive rather than engaging in a forward-looking strategy and business plan.  Too many sacred cows.  Morale isn't great given the poor to non-existent salary increases that have been the norm for way too long....

They will book one five star hotel and all u get is curd rice, tamarind rice, sambar rice and one chicken gravy and for this they say that they paid Rs1400 per head (if they really paid that much, it shows how ineffective they are, if they not paid that much and billed for Rs 1400, that show how corrupt they are 5) Only one sick room with one bed  for more than 550 employees"

- Work/life... balance has fallen by the wayside; middle managers work extremely long hours, and the unspoken expectation is that the employees will, too

"1338","new management ?"
"1339","Lots of management reorganization  and belt tightening over the past 4 years.  TR considers itself a middle of the road payer which in reality translates to pay being on the low side.

"1340","bureaucracy - like any other large old organizations."

"1353","While I was there, the Reuters merger seemed more like just another rock to add to the conglomerate, without any ""synergies"".
The multiple acquisitions meant multiple ticketing and tracking systems that made it very hard to collaborate across business units.
It was difficult to not work at headquarters- it felt like a backwater where I got all news months later than those at 3xSQ in New York."

"1364","Management is absolutely awful.  The complete lack of experience and professionalism makes life miserable.  Work-from-home opportunity is simply a trap to overload employees with work (no choice but to bring it home and work 60 hours a week).  Additionally this company is extremely cliquey.  The culture reminds me a lot of high school."
"1365","Very corporate. Employees are ok but not the best of the best, mostly because they were hired through acquisitions of companies that didn't have the clout to attract ""the best of the best"". Strategy unclear. Want to be a fully integrated company but not willing to take a hit on margins to invest in organic growth and people (engineers, intrapreneurs, etc.) who can actually execute on this strategy, so they end up... buying companies that are just ok, with just ok employees."

In the end we have mediocre products and training is non-existent.  As an example there is a push coming this fall to retrain 10,000 managers on how to better manage there teams.  Why is 20% of the workforce middle management?  Most of those managers spend more time... angling for a better job than actually empowering their folks to do their jobs.

"1376","Highly bureaucratic and structured, innovation is difficult."
"1377","Health care, no room for advancement, despite growth they keep making budget and bonus cuts, ""open door management"" doesn't really mean anything and the fact you work in the middle of a cornfield with old dirty carpeted walls isn't the ideal work environment for most.

August-October are more deadlines so you are only left a few decent months to sell."

""Why change and push new products to customers, when what I've been doing for years is working"" is a common attitude.  Learning to sell new technology and solution driven products takes time, sometimes involves failure but there is no wiggle room--make your number or your out (which explains the ""why change"" attitude). Little/no... opportunity for career advancement, hard to move laterally if you are not at management level.  Very low diversity in middle and especially upper management. Benefits are awful.  Some departments have flexibility, telecommuting, etc.  Completely up to your manager which creates tension among various groups.

Somehow, someone was able... to justify putting thousands of people out of work just to make sure the share-holders were happy. What a dismal demonstration.  The management at TR is apparently not creative, inventive or has any demonstrable problem solving skills. Their skills start and end at viewing a spreadsheet, looking at percentages and getting rid of staff if personal bonuses are at risk  genius

Unfortunately, these... introverted ""yes"" men become managers at PLC and they bring their lack of good judgment and social skills with them.

"1495","Talking about Financial & Risk division. What is written in the other reviews is absolutely true: this company is always finding a good excuse to re-organise at least every year. You can have great career opportunities so long as you're well politically positioned and based in the major centers (NYC, London in essence). Management seem to have been recruited on the same mould: they do not (don't know how to) listen.... They're all after their own numbers, short term and maintain the organization's structure so no dissonant voice can be heard (let's not even talk about HR...).
In fact, this is more than ever about greed: spending less and less yet seeking more and more, effectively driving people by fear (I don't think it's intentional but rather the result of some people's incompetence).
Hence the regular major marketing campaign in this company: yearly layoffs (contractors welcome to do the work that the people laid off were doing).
Nonetheless, the senior management commonly shows great sense of humour: a staff survey is released every year asking if staff believe that senior management cares about the well-being of their employees."

But because my team doesn't work on the clunker that is ""Eikon"", it has been completed annihilated, and so have most other teams that I work with. I suspect I will be gone in December 2014, never to work or to contribute to the economy again. 

It is incredible that the senior management are so... intellectually bankrupt that they have lapped-up everything that the Eikon management have sold them. (That is the flagship product, widely regarded by most as a piece of junk). The management actually, seriously believe that closing-down anything that isn't Eikon.....simply because it isn't Eikon.......is actually a good plan, even if those other products have loyal customer bases, and generate millions of dollars. 

I think the bottom line, echoed in other reviews, is that the management genuinely don't care about their employees, from the level of the most trivial thing, up to the most major. I suspect a lot of this is down to incompetence and the desire to save money, rather than any personal vindictiveness. For example, at the trivial level, people with 10-years long service awards sit next to people with 18 or 19 years service who have never received one. At the larger level, ex-Thomson employees are always made redundant in preference  to ex-Reuters employees, as the former have their redundancy payments capped. The feeling of unease and mistrust this creates is almost palpable. 

And never underestimate the ability of the company to be downright crass. An e-mail of 8 paragraphs begins with 7 paragraphs of how great and wonderful the company is doing, and how brilliant everyone is, is then followed up by a final paragraph announcing 3000 redundancies for no good reason.

Personal relationships are often how things are accomplished in business, and that can be particularly difficult in a global company, especially when there are significant restrictions on... travel and limited opportunity to engage with colleagues face-to-face in other locations.

"1612","The Thomson acquisition was the beginning of the end.  I've been working in big bad Corporate America for a while now.  I've seen entire divisions wiped out due to market downturns (read tech bubble crash).  I've seen highly profitable business units take the headcount ax during merger and acquisitions gone wrong.  But this was the first time I've seen a profitable, efficient, lean, mean, mature, smart  American... brand be completely decimated by slash and burn murders and decapitations style global capitalism.  Here's the story we've all heard about in the news, but which I had the displeasure of seeing up close at the scene of the accident:  Big global monster of a company with multiple, incongruous business units (Thomson) has a ton of cash.  But how to increase earnings each quarter to keep the analysts happy and my stock options going up this year asks the senior manager?  Growth through acquisitions is the answer.  But acquisitions wasn't quite enough.  How do you then ""create synergies"" among your new businesses where there is some overlap?  Layoffs is the answer.  Ok.  Hey, I get it.  You're running a business and have two people doing the same job in two different cities.  But wait, that's not quite enough to keep those senior management bonuses coming.  We've got margin improvement to show.  We've got EBITDA numbers to manipulate.  Now how do you do that?  Innovation?  New products?  Nope . . . offshoring.  Hey, it worked for Dell customer service right?  Oh wait, no that was actually a disaster, but what the heck, I'm not hanging around here more than a year anyway thinks the senior manager.  If I can cut costs, and show margin improvement by clearing a floor of tenured, highly regarded industry experts that the US and Global mutual fund communities have grown to know and love, and then replace them with dopplegangers in Mumbai, Bangkok, and Manilla at a third of the cost, things are looking good for me at year end.  And what's even better I can sell this story of ""realizing synergies"" to the next company I intended to gut!  Bloody brilliant strategy mate."

My experience is that management puts up a false front - pretending to be compassionate, empathetic and communicative with its employees - and it is on the surface. But digging deeper they are comfortable in their box - they will change a bit but still only within their box. The culture is strange - non entrepreneurial."
"1671","The company clearly does not care about its customer facing positions such as reference attorneys, tech support and customer service.  The latter of the two they simply outsource as much as they can, and skeleton staff the US based reps.  Since they cannot outsource the Reference Attorneys they run the department on the cheap so they can have as little staff as possible, while not making the large law firm customers... wait too long on hold.  The salary is a joke.  It was probably a good salary 30 yrs ago when many law school tuition rates were below 10K per year.  The ""merit increases"" which the company only gives if it does not lose too much money due to stupid management decisions does not even cover a cost of living increase.  And because the company considers the RSA department an entry level position, it does not matter if you are there for 1 year or 10 years, you will never get a significant bump in salary.  Because they get a lot of people to apply because of a horrible MN legal job market and too many law schools in the area there is no flexibility when it comes to the position, policies of the department, salary etc.  

You will simply be an employee number to them and that is it.  If you talk to the managers ""off the record"" they will admit the company and the department considers the employees replaceable parts and that they can make the job as bad as they want because there are always plenty of people looking for a foot in the door to the company.  If you do take the job, start planning your exit immediately.  Identify the part of the company you want to go to and start networking and get your name out there.  If you do not have interest in staying with the company long term I would put it like this...If you are, or about to be, homeless or starving take the job.  If not, do not bother with it."

In the end, this same management believed that these individuals were easily replaceable with TCS consultants.  1200 highly skilled SAP and IT systems analysts... let go, some after 30 years of service to a company.

"1696","Not that I know of."
"1697","Management always confusing. During my 3 years here I found more than once a year of 're-organization' ,'management change', and 're-decision' to their business plan which impact pretty much with individual contributor (and manager will always say this would be the last, final, absolute final of change). 

I actually cannot remember exactly who is my senior manager nor my department's name as it changed in every... single year I stayed (also they're using abbreviate from GMS CTO GMI IAAS DCO TFX S&T and that's a lot of division while I stayed only 3 years). It feels no different for myself in term of report manager and role as my immediate manager still the same while the work is not.

Also the company does not really care about their individuals yet their managers are their treasure. I don't think this is a good stuff when it comes to real business and you can see that is why the big things keep changing here. From CEO to their organization chart yet they still using most of the same person while rotating them from a role to another. Being honest here this is not a wise decision if a company really needs an improvement. TR needs a LOT more clearer vision and management team. Do things sharper.

This is pretty much impact in company performances. I think the results are already showed. Bloomberg already getting ahead of this company many steppes while Thomson Reuters still.. 'preparing themselves' for years since their merging.

Last thing I would like to add is company did suffer a lot from their staffs. I saw a lot of 'dismissal' which often calls 'reorganizing' 'resizing' 'reduce costs' and whatsoever. And this happens more than twice during my time there. This absolutely made their staffs fearing their status. (and yes, 3,000 staffs dismissal at 2013 is not a joke while 2011 and 2012 also did some of dismissal already) Question here is, why still recruiting another when company still needs to fire people after they got hired from a few months to a few years? Some kind of this organization's culture needs to improve.

I wish their new CEO (I was in Glocer era and James Smith just taken his place for only a few months) would re-arrange this matters and hoping they'll becomes 'rival' to Bloomberg once again."
"1698","Did not see any cons."
"1699","Not bad, but people are too cold"
"1700","Chaos, disorganization, poor leadership, constantly shifting and competing strategies, no innovation, poor benefits, the list goes on. 

When they say the only certain things in life are death and taxes, they haven't worked for Thomson Reuters financial and risk business. Here, the other certainty is that there will be a new ""executive strategy"" delivered every six months with a re-org as part of the process.... There is no such thing as real innovation in this business. Thomson Reuters notoriously acquires smaller companies to fill the product line gaps and rarely integrates well. Instead, the preference is to create ""optics"", a smoke screen illusion that all is well in the Land of the Deaf and Dumb and there is a plan, somewhere, a plan does exist and someone is executing on it so well you don't even realize it's happening. (Smile and nod like a good little drone.)

One step forward....  You can literally kill yourself working towards a goal and see it shatter in moments. This is due to a highly ""matrixed"" organization where no one has figured out who is on first. There are a whole lot of indians but very few real chiefs who will stand up, make a decision and take ownership of that decision. You will count away  minutes and hours of your life spent in meetings and conference calls that result in very little, if any, progress. Some teams you work with are massive, with each person owning some little slice of the pie. This makes ""progress"" akin to wading through molasses. Other teams are tiny, with no investment, and those folks work until their hands bleed for very little appreciation. And yet, there are no moves made to better align teams, define roles and trim the fat where needed. Learn to love chaos and a disorganized organization.

Be prepared with work with little or no budget for major projects. This is a reality for most segments within the Financial and Risk business. Though it's been a sinking ship for the past several years, the business keeps dumping money into further development of Eikon in the hopes of ""unseating"" Bloomberg in the trading terminal business. No amount of re-positioning of the messaging can change the fact that it is, at heart, a trading terminal and Bloomberg has the corner on that market... yet they persist. So, as money is being funneled by the truckload into that development do not expect any investment in other areas.

Advancement opportunities are radically different based on your location, business unit and direct manager. There is no progression planning that I've ever seen, nor any management training. In my previous business unit there was opportunity to advance, without pay increase, but at least there was opportunity to grow. Within financial and risk, your growth is entirely determined by your manager as the organizational structure is constantly shifting. 

As an organization with over 50,000 employees, one would think Thomson Reuters would provide excellent benefits both in terms of the standard health, 401k as well as additional ""talent retention"" perks. Not the case. While the health benefits aren't terrible, with 3 levels of plans to choose from, as of last year the company turned over more of the healthcare expense to employees resulting in most plans doubling in cost to the employee. What cost you $90.00 per paycheck last year now costs $180 (single employee, under 40, no dependents). 401K matching is meager with a vesting plan that extends out 5 years. Maternity/Paternity benefits are below average for US based employees as is vacation. Other benefits? I haven't seen any. Morale is consistently low, the annual employee survey consistently shows employees are dissatisfied with feeling valued and with benefits, and management's response is consistently the same: ""We hear you, but nothing is changing.""

You can break your back for this company, work many overtime hours, and act as their slave, and you WILL be kicked to the curb at the drop of a hat!

Individual contributions above and beyond the job are NOT recognized.  You are simply a... number!  Raises are non-existent, and forget about bonuses.  TR is constantly shifting more of the employee costs to the employees.  You will be paying more and more for your benefits each year. 

If you like high stress situations, no recognition for your efforts, constant reorganizations, and the fear of losing your job on a weekly basis, then Thomson is for you.  Otherwise, avoid it like the plague!  I have been there close to twenty years and have seen this company take a nose dive.  Top management doesn't have a clue when it comes to human resource management!  Totally oblivious to what goes on beneath them, and couldn't care less.  I cannot even recall how many different people I have worked for.  Constant management changes completely disrupts and destroys the working environment.  Remote managers may never even meet you, but they can somehow accurately report on your performance.  Remote managers always favor employees that are local to them, and shaft everyone else.

6.	Managers can get away with anything, simple  they will put the blame on their juniors, write off the hours, and guess what? The junior will have no clue about this.
7.	The Leadership is very able, but the people they are trusting and blindly following, reflects badly about how the company is managed.
8.	Yes, some people will always get promotions (every 6 months) and bonus  because they are only playing cards. 
9.	The leadership should monitor Women managers in Patents  this is a hint.
10.	Sometimes you feel you are working in a call centre because you are made to work from 8 am to 4am. If you succeed, they all will join you, if you fail  you will be cornered.
11.	The level of stress and frustration in people has only increased.
12.	We understand its all about moolah, there is no place for emotions at work, but the Leadership must understand that the managers cannot be blindly trusted."

"1734","They have stopped developing their own products and are acquiring companies that appear to ""fit"" into the business model.  However, the fit is often more wishful thinking than practical and the field reps get pressured to learn and sell products that are 2nd or 3rd tier and no one really understands how to position the value.

Every year, a new theme.  One year, they are a ""solutions"" company, the next year they... are a software company.  They want to hire reps with SaaS experience but can't pay for the talent.  Constantly looking outside the company for help solving the internal problems.

Very few people ever retire from the field organization.  Chances are you are going to be ""displaced"" or terminated and they will do nothing to help you find another position, internally.  Also, having a subscription-based job, where the industry knows that numbers are often inflated by gaming the comp plan, you are not going to be highly sought after.  That probably explains why so many former reps end up working for second-tier competitors."

"1749","Lots of layoff lately, Somewhat scary for many stable employees. Trying to realign the resources, but it is taking time and sometime good employees are getting fired. Lately many did not get raise for the past couple of years. People who returned 100% of their salary back to the company (Soft or hard savings ideas) also lost their job.

"1775","The last 4 years, it appeared the organizational chart kept changing every quarter, with sequential layoffs in droves, which was extremely bad for moral. There is very little upward mobility in professional growth. It has a very stale feel on the inside. Lots of depressed employees. Lots of managers act as bullies and play obvious favorites. Tons of office politics with managers consistently taking credit for your... efforts without letting you shine. The management seems intimidated by raw intelligence from direct reports, and quickly shuts down bright bulbs. If you are very good at kissing up, you may be able to survive there."

Also not likely you'll retire here, unless you get into management or you're 1 in a 100.

 Will buy a successful... company after it has peaked, then squeeze reps with higher quotas in shrinking and ever crowded market.  Will modify products, but rarely innovate.   

Each year expect higher quota, smaller territory, and lower commission.  Then get to hear about how profitable the last year was. Lesson? Buy a lot of stock, which you can get at discount.

They have you wrapped around their finger. Upper management have absolutely destroyed whatever morale the company had left. They call it transformational projects, I would call it trying to influence the stock price. Health insurance is... incredibly bad, lowest deductible plan is 1400. Egos about as well. If you're not in with the right crowd you're out. So let me get this straight they send 150 top sellers to Malaysia +1 and then lay off thousands. Just that trip could have save at least half those jobs. There is no corporate responsibility and ethically its no wonder this company's ratings continue to fall."

The way the organization functions is a little dysfunctional. It just seems really hard to get things done. Processes seem kind of crazy and the culture is the opposite of nimble. I also feel that my job (Manager level) is much more tactical... and administrative than it would be in other roles at similar sized companies. Mostly due to poor systems and processes in place that no one can/will fix. No vacation carryover. Benefits premiums are average."

Little area of growth for anyone outside of that dynamic. The entire place is run like a giant high school rather than a global mega corporation. We took a pool one day. One particular VP ONLY promotes people with blonde hair and/or blue... eyes (Scandinavian features). If you are a brunette or a minority, good luck with advancement outside of the token minorities in leadership that they have in place. These things are reported to HR, with facts and supporting evidence. HR does little to nothing putting such a great company at risk for a lawsuit from upset female and minority employees. Even if you are not a female or minority, if you didnt grow up with or are related to someone in management, good luck with your promotion. Also, extreme favortism is given to the slew of young 21 year old female bar flies they hire in the Sales and Marketing Divisions. Most got a job here because daddy or mommy works here. Imagine that being your manager after two years and you busted your hump for over a decade to be stuck at the same level."
"1877","Hierarchy, cutting cost now, and tight budget"

"1885","They've gotten so big that you will get lost in the shuffle. They no longer treat employees like human beings, you will be no more than data on a report. All the perks have been cut, my commissions and bonuses were cut in half two years in a row all in the name of the almighty bottom line. They simply couldn't afford those things any longer..then you would sit through a three hour long meeting listening to how great... the company is doing, how much it's growing and the fact that they ONLY made 12 billion (yes with a ""b"") in profits last year. They will push you and push you to sell more. If you do, they will find a way to fire you because they are paying you too much . If you don't, they will find a way to fire you  or make your life so miserable that you will quit as soon as you can. You'll think it's great for the first few months but you'll hear all these stories about what they've done to other  employees and you won't believe it....until you see them create a new department and move tenured top performers into it who immediately begin struggling to pull half their goals are gone within a few months."

One day there is no time to do anything, the other day two people are working on the same, and... when managers discover that, they just say 'it is good to have two heads thinking about a problem' (maybe it is, but not when there is no time for anything).
It is demotivating to work a lot on a solution, and later turns out that the other was working on that too, and has already done something, and his solution was accepted. Weak managers, chaotic organization."

"1889","You need to work hard and you're losing your work life balance. The company at the moment is in the complex situation in terms of competition and market share.

"1901","Technical people made to feel inferior to the hallowed journalists, very much old school staff hanging on till retirement blocking any advancement in company."
"1902","1) Have to travel all the way to Andheri (From Navi Mumbai)
2) Lot of people who gossips and spread negativity about the company, please stay away from them"
"1903","Work life balance is a struggle, Career progression is very slow."
"1904","Really bad health insurance, way too much red tape.  Directors and above are a bunch of yes men playing office politics from ivory towers.  1-3% raises are the norm, the attitude seems to be that you should feel great full to have a job.  Constant threat of outsourcing to India."
"1905","1) Lack of corporate strategy.  Managers managed through situations ONLY.  No aptitude for organizational planning or development.   My question to my manager about the company's strategic mission was met with a blank stare and maybe an UMMMM followed by awkward silence. 
2) Diminishing benefits/ Low Morale.  We found ourselves planning happy hours and ordering pizza to try to increase morale, because the things... that really made a difference to our staffers were lost in the large corporate machine.
3) Professionalism was often questioned.  
4) Best years are clearly behind this company.  We had 5 business unit heads in 8 years.  Each one had to come in and learn our business.  This constant cycle did not lend itself to the type of top-down support needed to reach aggressive revenue targets."
"1906","Staff that cannot share empathy to clients. Management rarely listening to staff about direction of firm. Little scope to progress with the HR the real masters of the universe."
"1907","Too many org changes
Many changes to sales comp plan that seemed to cap/control costs. Worked harder, sold more, but made less the last few years.
At times, management would reward people that fail with lower quota and increase quota for top performers."
"1908","A lot of boring legacy technologies. The pay is below average for some people."
"1909","Balancing management, communication, and work tasks can sometimes be challenging."
"1910","- Long working hours - You got to be at work till 10 or 11 PM and you're also expected to show up at 8 AM the next day.

- Project Management Profile -  They offered me a designation of 'Sr. Associate to Project management Officer' which is surprisingly no where related to project management. Its plainly MIS work. That is, you just keep developing same crappy reports over & over again. 

- Projects - What does a... Project Manager OR a Sr. Associate expect? To successfully work on a project and deliver it. Worst part here is, YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY PROJECTS TO WORK ON and the team is still called the PM TEAM.

- Dig everyday, to find water - As you do not have projects, you need to find your own work. Keep yourself busy, actually portray yourself as busy. Advice given by other PM team mates... 

-Destroying your CV - As a Sr. Associate to PM, you need to mention the projects you had worked on to your resume. Now that this place doesn't have any projects, you are clueless how will you design your CV for coming years.

- Meetings - Sr. Associate is expected to conduct REGULAR (twice or thrice a week) meetings with Sr. Staff members for a single point agenda of increasing the revenue. HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU SUPPOSE TO DESCRIBE THE SAME THING TO Sr. Staff members? Are they not equipped or knowledgeable enough to understand the same thing in 2, 3 or 5 meetings. If they are, why are we suppose to take on the same meeting EVERY WEEK? 

- Examples of increasing revenue - Make people slog, cut their leaves, billing related issues. IS THIS EXPECTED TO BE PROJECT MANAGEMENT? Over n above you have to find ways to describe the same thing with a new beautified presentation twice a week? Guess what, you compile various reports come up with a new crappy form of a report and present it AGAIN. With SAME BLOODY CONCLUSION.

- Statements of Managers - ""You should be workoholic (Excuse me! I got life apart from office)"" / ""You should come up with new reports (mind you, for the same single point agenda)"" / ""You have lost interest (obviously, this is not Project Management)""/ ""Can you come to work by 8 (messages me after reaching home at 11)"""
"1911","It is hard to grow in side this organization."
"1912","very poor culture driven by a few senior managers who are left to run their own book with out checks and balances for treatment of individuals"

"1914","Cubicles, Lost easily, Lots of parking"
"1915","Depends where you land..TR is a huge company made up of a lot of small non-cooperating fiefdoms. Each unit has it's overlords and they're pro's at playing the ""you watch my back and I'll watch yours"" game.

So, net net, those that really know their stuff, usually don't get the promotions.

Very cliquey environment and advancement is primarily based on whose butt you kiss..

Also, this company practices agism... like nobody's business. Of all the job cuts in the past number of years(and there's been A LOT), it seems like the over 50's are the first to go. In fairness, this is a societal issue.

And going back to before the merger, both companies had a record of growing through acquisitions. And on the Reuters side, for some unexplained reason, the people who built the products/companies they bought, left after all the mergers. So, good luck getting something fixed for a client on a legacy platform."
"1916","But moving around, changing departments/channels and career path are the only way you'll get a pay increase. Management is disjointed within the company and nothing more than yes men. Upper level management can't seem to get a clear vision for the company and therefore hemorrhage VPs at an alarming rate. Products are in decline. Staff and sales executives are wholly underpaid for the market.  Bottom line emotes are... devalued and treated like cattle."
"1917","Quite a many leadership changes.
Currently undergoing major transformation impacting employees"
"1918","The company is incredibly bureaucratic, slow and lacks clear direction. Instead of aggressively pursuing growth, they seem to be trying to squeeze everything they can from their employees and customers."
"1919","Sometimes we spent too much time for a meeting  each day."
"1920","Company was a very large bureaucracy and with so many people in many disparate areas, it was a challenge to maintain facetime. Work from home is nice but TR had a mit of a problem with out of sight, out of mind mentality which caused many good folks to lose their jobs as execs in NY would make random determinations of who and from what offices should go. B/c it is a for profit company, short term profits became much... more important than building a long-term and growing organization. As a result, layoffs continue to occur even though at the outset of the Thomson Financial/Reuters merger, management stated that no more than 10% right-sizing would occur. At this point, I would bet it is closer to 40% or more."
"1921","But for the recent year, the training are very much reduced to online learning."
"1922","Hard work and loyalty is not rewarded. 10 years ago the people hired were always reliably good and people you wanted to work with. Too often now people are hired on basis of professional qualification with little thought given to whether they are able to do the job or get on with their colleagues. Result = lots of very frustrated, underpaid decent employees increasingly looking elsewhere...This will not assist the... company in retaining and growing profit."
"1923","-No cons to put up"

Terrible communication about company direction nor enhancement in your career."
"1926","VERY political.  If you are not in the right group, this company sometimes does not promote on performance rather than your clout and/or relationships within the company."
"1927","Compensation not up to mark.. Also in recent times a lot of insecurity over job loss"
"1928","There is a lack of accountability at all levels, at least compared to Fortune-100 companies I have worked. Morale is very low likely due to several lay offs and outsourcing taking place. Middle management seems bloated and has a sense of entitlement."
"1929","Lots of restructuring, all the time, at the top levels which creates a slight mood of instability.  
Many decisions made are political, with very little on the ground knowledge  helping to inform those decisions.
Focus is on how to get the most out of customers rather than providing products to meet customer needs. Sales teams have too many products to push, making it internally competitive for the marketing teams."
"1930","TR is not any longer a Technology Company; it is a purely profit driven, private-equity type of firm where management does not have any ability to look for long-term strategies and take the time to build innovative, reliable technology products"
"1931","1. TR is an established Organization with surplus human resource,  proving yourself is a challenge
2. With the recent job cuts, the uncertainty is always there"

"1934","Quality of front line supervisors varies.  I felt that some people were supervisors just because they were there the longest."
"1935","Cost saving measures resulted in many experienced staff being made redundant, and high new staff turnover makes it hard to maintain quality and expert knowledge that the company depends on.
Brutal timescales on the projects I worked on - very poor up front planning on business case and project scope."

"1944","Be smart, proactive, dynamic and forward-looking"
"1945","Lack of coherent strategy, pay is average for the City"
"1946","Benefits are scarse. Inflation adjustments are awful (even living in Argentina). Middle and Senior Management are unprepared and have a terrible judgement. In Latam there is a lack of transparency that is scary. HR is fiction, most of the offices dont even count with HR representatives and the turn over in HR doesnt help."
"1947","Too many changes happen daily...."
"1948","Favoritism by middle management, Less pay, monotonous work life , Self development opportunities are less especially in Legal department and they have been made online from classroom sessions. Hr and Team leads don't respect their subordinates. No value of time of others. Team Leads, AM less qualified to become managers thus making them incompetent."
"1949","Slow self development, relatively lousy management"
"1950","changes in management does not stabalize"
"1951","HR leadership is more worried about how late you are in the office vs quality of work
HR leadership isn't supportive of people from the outside or with more experience
""Challenge"" = cut heads this quarter.   Way to cut costs is through RIFs"
"1952","C level management always changing, with new priorities and transformation initiatives every 3 months.  Company is desperately trying to become an innovative growth company like Apple, but never quite gets there.  Pay is just okay."
"1953","commission reports frequently wrong and not paid"
"1954","Weak/absent leadership, inconsistent pay policies, major changes taking place."
"1955","Trop de priorits contradictoires et l'accent est trop mis sur la rduction des cots, pas assez sur les revenus."

"1957","Less growth oppotunity due to the large team size."
"1958","None that I can think of."
"1959","Eikon division is an ugly place to work in. Completely talentless middle management, rude, screaming and lying boss. I could not read Dilbert cartoon while I was working there. It resembled my life too much."
"1960","Not a great Pay Master"
"1961","Upper management was so focused on bottom line and efficiency of production that quality of product slowly degraded. This was dis-spiriting; one takes pride in good products, not in great masses of mediocre work. Few dared express this. Most managers were great, but some of those left. A few were micromanaging sociopaths and they stayed. Upper management's duplicity and contempt for employees was noticeable."
"1962","Limited opportunities for advancement in Carrollton, but there seems to be better options if you're willing to relocate."
"1963","1.Politics comes first than performance for promotions
2. Growth is dried up now at TR"
"1964","Salary seemed to be on the lower side(heard often enough), and opportunities for promotion did not come around much at all."
"1965","Personal Development
Need to work upon continuous learning and improvement"
"1966","Upper management and strategy changed every few months. Nothing in the US seemed to be growing. Company culture was undefined at best. At worst, it was a conflicting amalgamation of the many different cultures of numerous acquisitions."
"1967","Company is not back filling positions left by other analysts so work load is piling up and also it seems harder to move up and be promoted"
"1968","Upward growth limited by location."
"1969","Leadership is poor - mediocre on its best day, very good at spouting b-school management spiel, no credentials at following it up with action, mostly spend time on social and professional networking sites  and in unproductive meetings
There isn't any work-life balance. There is an expectation that you work 
Incentives and promotions are a farce - is opaque, biased and ad hoc - Corporate nepotism is a way of life... here. 
Leadership has no trust in their colleagues or employees - politics is rife within the upper echelons - they are mostly playing a blame game without anybody stepping up to shoulder the responsibility
One senior member I reported to told me ""You should be willing to suck toe of the senior members"" - a statement that reflects on the quality of the leadership. 
Solution to any problem - throw more people at them
The team here is myopic - Unable to see beyond their noses - They will do anything to save revenue - including overworking existing employees to hiring en-masse, low-cost underqualified people"
"1970","Extremely slow growth. Lots of politics. Promotion will be given only for those who are close to managers. No onsite.  Even if there is onsite it will be very rare and for people who has good rapport with manager. No  development projects at Bangalore. All are maintenance work. Employees will be bored of same work every day for years together.  Not a suitable for people who are looking to start their career."
"1971","job cuts
job insecurity & less growth opportunities"
"1972","Good luck moving up in the company - they either hire from the outside to replace someone in management who left or don't bother replacing the manager at all and just pile the departed manager's responsibilities onto other managers and staff."
"1973","Leadership is not empowered to impact change and as a result, the business seems to be moving further from client needs."
"1974","I really can't think of any cons in the position I am in. I'm a software engineer, and everything is managed how it should be, the work load is the right balance so it doesn't bring you down after a day of work, and everyone is really understanding and helpful if you have a problem. Only con I can think of is the dodgy lifts that scare the heck out of you every now and then!"
"1975","The manager I worked for likes to play politics which I don't really like"
"1976","Lack of stability.  Frequent reorganizations and reduction in force, so employees work in a constant state on uncertainty."
"1977","Organizational change is the norm.  Very unstable management."
"1978","Lean career path due outsourcing"
"1979","Team creativity is stifled by poorly designed hierarchies and departmental silos, despite corporate  ""innovation"" incentive programs. The response to dismal employee satisfaction ratings is for everyone to take an online course about how to be a good employee. Raises and bonuses are pathetic unless you're a manager level or above, then the company rewards you for how much your headcount has been reduced, and how... soul crushed your employees are willing to be."
"1980","Before implementing changes, please take the time to first meet and get to know the people on the team as well as learn what the functions of the team are and the best practices in place.  Once these are understood, then promoting change can be done with mutual respect and buy-in."
"1981","salary; constant re-orgs; strict HR policies"
"1982","No tenho nenhum ponto negativo num mbito geral, apenas uma colocao, porm acredito que seja mais relacionado a equipe onde estou situado, que vejo certas promoes que ocorrem indevidamente, talvez seja um ponto falho a questo de melhorar a anlise de quem realmente merea uma promoo."

Many in leadership turn a blind eye to unethical practices
Constant restructuring
HR certainly does not work on the behalf of employees even though the company has enormous PR around talent development, goal setting and open door policy"
"1984","This is my second time working for Thomson and this will probably be the second time my group will be sold. There may be room to move up here, but it is not made clear. The vast majority of the company seems to be striving for mediocrity."

"1988","Low salary, is the main dis advantage"
"1989","Leadership changes, strategy shifts constantly."
"1990","Unstable company where employees are treated like things.   Lack of leadership so no innovation and no growth.  To hide this the executives keep reorganizing every six months.   Look at their 10K filings.  To make up for no growth they cut costs by continuously replacing staff with younger and cheaper staff.  The company is living off the success of old product lines."
"1991","senior management needs to realize no one will join the company if they realise that once after you reach a certain level in the organsiation, the reshuffle to kick out the now expensive employees so that you can bring a bunch of new employees at lower salary will be counter productive one day. also the senior management needs to know people should be promoted on merits and not the noise they make in the office"
"1992","Me agregou pouco conhecimento"
"1993","low margin, avg pay and communication overheads"
"1994","Compensation is same for post graduates and graduates and not satisfied with the packages and promotions"
"1995","Actions speak louder than words and the negative culture actions are louder than the positive words.  Short term outlook as planning is very responsive and very reactive.  Very much a ""flavor of the year"" type approach to goals, themes and strategy."
"1996","Specific to this job role, you have the cons you get in any job focused on customer service (you may have to deal with some stressed out unreasonable people).  Everything is based on seniority so you may have to work an unusual schedule when you first start."
"1997","Thomson Reuters is a big mish mash of companies. They acquire small companies left and right, then try to squeeze them into the TR mold. But they don't spend enough time nurturing the companies and figure out how to fit them in. I worked for a group that had been acquired 6 months before. During my two years with the company, our small group moved sections of the company 4 times! That means different systems,... different managers, etc. It was confusing and pointless. I was also told when I was hired that there was no room for advancement. What type of HR person tells someone that? A huge company and no room to advance? Especially for someone with several years of experience? Odd."
"1998","sole reason for my alcoholism"

"2001","Too many leadership changes and org. restructuring that leads to changes in goals and visions"
"2002","Alguns processos so muito lentos dentro da empresa, ou no so muito bem mapeados, causando confuso de equipes."
"2003","This is entirely my experience of my particular division as I know others in the Company work in a more logical structure...  

There's an inability of management to delegate responsibility and therefore all decisions are made by committee so consequently very little is achieved. Far too many Director/VP roles and very few people to carry out the work that needs to happen.  No career progression - promotions are... not an option and teams change through external hires.  Recent restructure means roles are far narrower - which makes the role content far less rewarding and far more mundane."

"2010","There are too many re-organisations, which causes low morale for those remaining."
"2011","All work, no life.  Compensation constantly being lowered for sales positions.  Leadership non-existent. Treatment of sales staff is deplorable.  Sales staff the only people in the company who are not entitled to vacation without their managers approval (which may be refused if not at quota during any period)."
"2012","Low pay, managers are watching and worrying about the managers above them instead of how to help the front-line staff get work done. In the end, the focus is on shareholders. Management treats workers are like peons."

"2014","Compensation is not so good."
"2015","Vague and fluid organization structure and competition for survival of many geographically remote nucleolus offices (results of many acquisitions) sometimes leads to bizarre and illogical transfers of projects between the teams.

"2042","You may receive only your base salary if cancellation exceeds sales values (happens quite a lot since the Lehman Shock as most of our clients have been cutting cost).  Account managers' commission is based on its quarterly net sales (gross sales - cancellations).
Account managers often need to stay longer to deal with their clients' problems and complaints....
Too many organization changes, instead of putting more... energy to make their products and services more competitive.  
Many senior employees have been cut in the last 2-3 years, so goes their deep industry knowledge.

Senior management tends to employ and promote their buddies, not the best employee. Don't expect promotions, and expect to fight for a raise. Good performers are not rewarded proactively. Very lazy staff are abundant. A lot of very poor people managers among senior... ranks. They happen to be friends of leadership, and are good at managing up but terrible at managing teams, instead cause tons of conflict. West coast sales team needs shaking up.

I was a top performer on my sales team, and as a result, I dealt with a great deal of animosity, gossip, and almost high schoolish bullying from others on my team.  People would openly not invite me to company outings, and more importantly, openly refuse to help me when I... needed assistance with a task.  People were not even civil to me which made my work life very tense.  Comments were made about my appearance, ethnic background and unflattering posts were made about me on social media, some of which were even defamatory.

I tried to take the high road but in order to keep an appearance of having a ""great"" team, my manager failed to even speak to my peers or take any action to discourage this sort of thing.  I produced excellent numbers.  However, eventually the daily hostility I faced got to me and I started breaking down emotionally.  Instead of being supportive, my manager basically suggested that I was the one with issues and couldn't get along with people.  People in my division of Thomson Reuters were very petty and did not want to see me succeed.  I eventually broke down and out of frustration, I said some things to my manager I could not take back and was let go.  So the bullies won.  Yet they celebrated my defeat publicly on social media.  I had grounds for a defamation suit but opted to never look back.  However, I do think future job seekers should be aware of what I went through.  Great culture right?"

Management expects employees to work in their roles for 5 years or more without questioning about growth options in terms of position or compensation. If the employee achieves a few years seniority, the managers typically play a waiting game for... these folks to leave the company - trying to get rid of the talent pool and potential threat for their survival. Once these employees leave, the managers portray that they have managed successful execution of the business goals with being under-staffed and have gone through huge pains - not even once letting the company's executive team become aware of the lost talent, the reasons for losing human capital and how the company is being hurt by these strategies.

It makes... selling in the small firm market a very tough go since support expectations can be lacking.

Management style has changed in the last couple of years, with stories of higher-level managers reaching out and contacting sales people, rather than communicating with the direct line manager.  You start to wonder what the purpose is of having a sales manager, what they're actually doing.

In conversations with people who have recently left the company, they've changed the compensation program in such a way that it has become very hard to make money,partly because they've raised the sales expectations so high that making your number has become really a huge hurdle, and hence, making a good buck.

Marketing management is also weak. Just because one has a JD does not make them a good marketing manager. To transform marketing, bring in MARKETING people who know how to market.

"2178","Since 2008 it's been almost annual reorgs of the sales force as the company tries to find growth.  If senior management gets up at a meeting and promises ""no more re-orgs,"" don't believe it for a second.  If you're smart you can end up in a good position for the following year, or you can end up in a bad spot.  New comp plans and territories will be launched on Jan 1 each year and ""surprise"" here's your mission for... the next 12 months, you will have very little say in the matter.  It's not political (mostly), its just whatever management decides is the strategy du jour.  If you don't work in New York or Minnesota, your career options are going to be very limited, and it will be just a job.  HR only hires and fires, they pay no attention to ongoing employees."
"2179","Where to start? First and foremost, despite corporate rhetoric about supporting employee development, there is zero opportunity for career growth unless you are based in (or desire to move to) NYC or Minnesota. Even if you are genuinely interested in challenging yourself with a new role in the company, if you don't work for one of the divisions arbitrarily defined as ""legal solutions"", you'll be looked at as... deadwood. 

When factoring in average education and experience, pay is abysmal unless you are in sales. After all, why would anyone expect Thomson Reuters to pay top dollar for the creative people who actual make, and update, the products, when they can just spend that money on an annual sales team junket to some warm vacation spot? In addition to pretty stagnant pay, the benefits have fallen precipitously over the past four years. Even financially-neutral perks like being able to ""carry over"" five days of unused vacation from one year to the next, have been eliminated in the name of ""consistency across locations"".

So many functions, departments, and people have been outsourced or offshored in recent years that there remains little accountability for quality in any one place or team. As the old saying goes, when something is everyone's responsibility, it is no one's responsibility. 

Finally, there are constant reorganizations and changes of focus, which only serve to confuse rank-and-file employees every six months (not to mention generating additional fear of layoffs). 

All in all, Thomson Reuters remains a management-heavy bureaucracy, but without any of the perks, pay and benefits that formerly made it an attractive place to work."

This means that companies take a long time to integrate and employees follow inefficient processes ""because that's how we always did it at xyz acquired company"". Big companies need to have processes, some bureaucracy etc., but TR takes it to a new level of inefficiency. It's like a leaky supertanker.

This means lots of people live in constant, justified paranoia of being laid off.  It seemed like we had a new executive team every 6 months, with new ideas about where we were going and how we would get there. It doesn't sound that bad, but... by the time I left (I was laid off, obviously), I was exhausted and stressed from constantly trying to re-define my role and adjust to new bosses and new strategies.

The front-line supervisors are forced into compromising positions and are used as the axe men to chop the heads... of the lowly employees while upper management continues to roll in the dough.  This disgusting and immoral environment brings out the absolute worst in human nature and the behavior of the supervisors.

Our business was reassigned into a different unit of TR three times... and the product was losing market share hand over fist. Projects would start with a great idea, only to be nitpicked or funding to be cut so much that the end result was a joke and didn't sell. Needless to say, with all the hot potato, the pay was pretty poor and they were always coming up with stories to lower our bonuses. Not a whole lot of opportunity to advance in the company.

There have also been several instances where... individual's roles were eliminated as they were preparing for retirement.  Products are often rolled out before are really ready, leaving customers with a negative view of the product even after it has been perfected.

"2585","Firstly, what all i am putting below is mainly for Technology operations and Product IT related jobs. If you are in Marketing, Sales, Media or Research, things may be different but part of below may still be applicable.

- There is absolutely no career growth if you are working from India no matter which position you join in as. Most managers in US/UK will simply showcase themselves for all the work done in rest... of the world and eat all the big positions.

- After the Reuters merger, the company looked unstable for a while as most of the fractured but diplomatic Reuters Leadership overtook the larger and more organised Thomson Leadership. Now to hide that instability, the UK centric (and some hand in glove orthodox US) so called ""strategic"" management from Ex Reuters has propelled tricks of outsourcing, severe cost cutting etc. to inflate the stock prices, but make no mistake - most of these termite ridden pillars may come down soon.

- Projects just drag and drag in the name of process, strategy, framework and governance. Though the company boasts of Information Technology products, most of the members in leadership don't even know the meaning of technology. All they know is to say the word ""strategy"" a 100 times each day and get a million dollar pay check every quarter for that.

- Frankly speaking there is actually an urgent need for layoffs in the company as almost half of the company does redundant work. But what is actually happening is that most of the very redundant staff is sitting in the leadership or have Godfathers in the leadership and company is facing outsourcing and severe attrition of some really talented folks.

- The company wastes money on lots of unnecessary events and process related tasks and though the company has ""talent"" and ""performance"" as its so called values, not many in the Management have an idea as to what these words mean, forget implementing. If you are looking for constructive travel opportunity/trainings, then simply forget it as in current ""cost-cutting mode"", the company would rather throw the money in some stupid activity than spend on the growth of their employee."

...While on paper they call it an account manager position the the reality is that it's mostly new business focused.  So if you're looking for a true account manager position look elsewhere because at least 50% of your time will be spent trying to win new business.  You may see virtually nothing for those efforts but management at the time and maybe now management places a big priority on... quantity of cold calls and number of demos.  which is silly because the offering is expensive (for tax departments) and companies that benefit most are large, public and global.

The territory will make or break you.  Again when selling to larger companies, the deal size is largely based on how big the company is that your selling to, is it a 2 person tax department or one with 39 in the US and 150 globally.  The latter will obviously be a bigger project with higher software license fees and a bigger implementation budget.  

Where are big companies located?  In major metro areas, so that's where you'll want to work IF you want to hit quota and make money talked about during interviews.  

Another con is that they give all the reps the same number to hit.  This is just foolishness as the bar is set too low for some, far too high for others and MIGHT be appropriate for those in the middle.  For example 3 different people worked the New Jersey territory, all exceeded quota by 150% or more.  Is it the reps who were so talented? Or maybe NJ lends itself towards that much in sales...and it's not that the sales rep was so spectacular, they just didn't mess up a good thing.

Management is definitely knowledgeable about the product but they never did any sales grunt work  so what comes out of their mouth about actually selling and winning NEW business is opinion and theory.

Current sales managers were those who showed the product (product solutions experts or called ""business development"" at this job), cold calling was never something they did, so they also can't appreciate how long a sales cycle can be from 1st cold call to sign contract.  It could be a year or longer when you're calling a company truly from a cold start.  If a companies auditor says ""get software"" that can really slant a deal in your favor. 

Out of 10 legitimate sales opportunities 4 at most will come from things you exclusively start cold.  Again going back to how each rep gets the same quota, reps also get a list of current clients to retain and sell to.  

Some reps make more than 50% of their sales selling to current clients.  You may also do joint deals with big accounting firms/channel parters so working with them can be very advantageous.  You may also get business from other reps on Thomson Reuters tax and accounting.

 These things can be very lucrative if they work in your favor, and frustrating if they dont.

The good territories IE, southern Cali, NYC, NJ, Houston, Chicago etc...you know areas full of ideal prospects and customers, reps who work these areas probably arent leaving and if they do, those territories won't be given to someone brand new.

Work here at your own risk.  you could get lucky in your first 6 months if you inherit outstanding deals the previous rep was working on. 


If you dress nice and play patty cake the way management likes they'll say youre doing great.  
If you close deals like this and arent liked, they'll say you're lazy and you can expect a ""performance improvement plan"" 

If you work hard and it's not working out, it's not entirely your fault, management may have an opinion about things you can ""improve"" upon but what really makes someone successful or not is the list you get to work.  Again that list should contain some outstanding business to chase and close, cold calls, current clients (at least 15 to work with) channel partners to network with etc.  

Again working in a concentrated territory such as Manhattan or Chicago, you can do smart things like hold a user group and get customers to mix and mingle.  You don't have this option working a scattered territory that consists of a bunch of states in the midwest. 

With sales jobs like this the big difference between average and successful reps is the list one gets to work.  The rest is all largely opinion.  

Much of what is written here is applicable to many other companies.  

Most companies have weak
or non-existing sales and marketing strategies
and have no way to track
the strategies they do have 

Doing the job and managing it are 2 different things.  The average b2b sale is 7 months.  And most managers think that if it takes this long it's because sales people aren't working so they like to hire, train, let go, and train over and over. 

Sales training and hiring is too often a knee jerk solution to what's really a marketing problem.  Real marketing consists of uncovering WHO the client really is and how many there are to market to.  Often times sales managers are far removed from the process and take an over simplistic and over eager approach to winning new business.  Employee over turn is a symptom of this.  It's like wake up already....obviously the accounts new reps get is cherry picked completely or to a degree.  It's not realistic to keep hiring people to work the bottom 20% of your prospect list and expect a different result. 

And while this is fancy shmancy ""corporate b2b sales"" it's not much more complicated than say...the restaurant business. 

Too many servers and they complain they don't make money.

Too few servers and they might make money in the short term but service suffers and damages the restaurants reputation in the long run.  

Again proceed here with caution, both sides may have the best intentions but the way the game is designed by higher ups at TR and played out by management, means it may not work out well for both.  And if it doesn't it's made out to be far too personal - at least that was the case for me.  (but this happens all the time in sales) 

Also this is also what you could consider a mature business.   This was a business acquired by Thomson in 2008.  It's likely done it's thing already - and it's very very absorbed into the Thomson Mother ship.

if you're looking to do your job and also innovate and champion new projects this is not the place. 

In the past new hires who have become successful have not only inherited some good accounts to work on, but have also been good at brown nosing and being liked. 

If you've been there for a while and haven't hit your number even though you worked hard for what you did do, move on, find something that's moving and shaking.  Especially because most employers these days want someone with not just software experience but also experience in a vertical.

If you'll stay in tax and accounting, then fine, if you don't see yourself in tax and accounting all the more reason to move on. 

Again, not dining this segment of the TR tax and accounting business, might be great for non sales people, but for sales not so much in my experience."

"2795","I worked in QA, and despite constantly being told that QA is vital, blah blah de blah, I constantly felt like I was being treated as a hoop to jump through before deploy, instead of a member of a team and a peer. There was also rarely money to hire testers-- we frequently continued with bad tester to dev ratios because there ""wasn't budget"" for another tester, and had to make due with stopgap solutions of interns... (some really solid, some not, and all of them needing training in) and contractors (generally technically solid, not necessarily a QA background, and always leaving soon because we weren't allowed to keep contractors more than X amount of months).

In general, I was incredibly poorly managed. The flat structure was working against you here-- my lead was handling multiple teams using multiple different technologies and never really had time to understand what exactly **I** was facing until I came to them with a crisis, despite having given them a lot of warnings when that crisis was just in ""kind of a problem"" or ""could be a problem"" mode. 

Heaven forbid you had a hotfix, that was *always* QA's fault, despite QA not being given enough time to thoroughly test and saying so, or something not being ever conveyed to QA as a testable. Also, interpersonal politics meant that my team was constantly being scrutinized by people much higher up because of personal beefs. 

Shortly into my time at Thomson, I was thrust into a role that had previously been filled by a senior tester. They retired, I got their role-- with all the same expectations, despite **not** being experienced enough or knowledgeable enough to fill it. Look, I was a dumb recent grad who thought I knew more than I did, some of that's on me, but a lot more is on the manager who made that call. When issues arose from this, my lead was supposed to help me handle them-- and I got nothing. I felt extremely unsupported by my lead and felt like I was an antagonist to the developers on my team. I also felt dicked around-- I went from being told in a performance review that I was looking at a promotion soon to being told two weeks later that I needed to shape up or they'd put me on an improvement plan (and, the implication was, fire me if I didn't improve).

When personnel issues arose, my managers shifted the responsibility of dealing with them to me, treating me like a peer instead of mediating potential problems. I eventually had to file an HR complaint over a situation that could have been ameliorated by some handling by my manager from the beginning.

Time management in general was also terrible. Thomson gives a decent amount of vacation time, but I constantly felt like I couldn't take it because of the timelines and pressure to deliver put on me. They were pretty good about leaving the work at work and not taking it home, but if you wanted to take more than a day of vacation, expect to get some dirty looks. This was compounded because I was the sole tester for a team, and had no reliable backup who could take over release testing if I wanted to take vacation.

There was a lot of privileging the appearance of an agile team over actually building sustainable agile practices. Also, Thomson talks a big game over being able to transfer around in the company, but in practice, nah."

Pay for technical jobs is... subpar and too dependent on how well you market yourself, not what you actually produce. No career growth for senior developers / technologists, except on a managerial path.

On an HR note, the stacked ranking that was put in place in the last couple years was a terrible idea. The questions that it forces front line managers to ask are valuable, but the policy itself encourages cutthroat behavior, not collaboration. Did they not learn from other companies that tried this method and suffered for it?

Onboarding of technical staff is not handled well. No training. It is very much up to the front line managers, some of whom have too many direct reports to be effective.

Terminations / departures are also not handled well. Poor communication from upper-mid / senior management, who seem to have no clue that withholding information only blindsides the people on the front lines, those whose livelihoods are most impacted by such changes, and it breeds resentment and distrust."

Management never gave all information about the market when a new product was being launched, this made selling very hard,... as you would visit customers and find out there were 30 other products on the market that did it better than your new product. There is an amazing lack of diversity in Legal, from Eagan to the field.  Very few sales reps of color and not a lot of options for advancement.  The health insurance is awful compared to other companies. If you are a field-based employee then you don't have a lot of options for advancement.

"2905","About 2004 major cost cutting started with a program called ""fast forward"", since then much of the pressure to increase returns for investors has been met by cost cutting rather than revenue growth. It is typical to get emails from the CEO that say words to the effect ""well done we have grown revenues by 2%, ..... bla bla bla.  We are going to cut XYZ"".  For the past 3 years I've seen cuts about every 6 months. Over... the past 10 years it is hard to remember a year in which there were no cutbacks. In 10 years the IT department started off in-house then it was outsourced to IBM, then Fujitsi, then brought in house, now being outsourced again. There are the typical/stupid frustrations of we have budget for X but not for Y. For example no budget to buy descent computers for developers, rather than spend $1000 to upgrade a computer, they will pay someone much more to sit around and do nothing because they are waiting for their under powered out-dated computer. A lot of big company policies. You can choose any two from these, cheap, quick, quality. Cheap and quick is the priority now, quality used to be the priority, but that's no longer the case.  Get the software out there and worry about it later appears to be the management motto now.  There seems to be a belief that you can swap any team out, so a team that knows a product inside out can all be let got and the product handed over to a team that knows nothing about it; people and teams are not plug-and-play like that. Often a conservative approach to doing things, this does not mean quality it means unnecessarily sticking with old technology, this can be to the point where they are using hardware and software that is a decade beyond it's official end of life, indeed some hardware would more suited to a museum."

Time off can be difficult to get due to lack of coverage.  It seems like the ability to move up depends on who is interviewing you and how long you have been there.  Your previous skills and what you bring to the table are completely... useless.  The year minimum of being in an entry level job of a call center is not useful.  It should be six months for entry level positions to provide mobility for fast-starters who get bored of this position and start to look for other opportunities elsewhere.  

Pay is also a difficult balance.  You do not get any bump in pay for an entire year, no matter how well you do, how much better you are compared to your peers or how many products you learn.

--Stagnation in certain departments -- there was a logjam in the editorial ranks, whether it seemed like people came to the editorial department to hang out and write about what they know until they die, rather than to try for a promotion. Note though that this could be a good or bad, depending on who you are. That may be exactly what you want to do, or if you're a young and ambitious professional, be prepared to get your experience and find that you need to move on, because no one's leaving their rolls so no one else is getting promoted (i'd add again that this was 2009-2011 and things may have changed)."

On the call were sales managers who actually started shouting at me because they were upset that this initiative was not further... along than it was.

One of the biggest complaints from allover IT was that there was little support or funding allocated for obtaining new IT certifications or keeping existing IT... certs up to date.  In many cases free training credits TR was comp'ed would go unused and expire rather than hand them to people that needed training because the were poorly m\managed.  I guess that's what happens when you have too few people, some things just get overlooked. I should say that working directly for a Business Unit was very different and better than working for the crop shared services group."

Was not allowed to transfer to the department, and if I left the company before... 1 year, I had to pay back the signing bonus!! I tried to stick it out, then found out by my former manager (who also left the company), that your success rises and falls based on the territory you are given. If you're in a bad territory, then so be it. I witnessed and heard stories of managers hand selecting candidates for transfers to other departments and these were not solely based on hitting your sales goals. It's a 100% old boys club. Not to mention that your job, was to scour your account list and offer your clients a book volume discount, based on them buying more product when this is a CLEAR violation of the company ethical policy to ""never offer a customer a discount based on purchasing a new product or service"".

I became a business analyst when the department had just moved from waterfall to agile and I think that not having come through the ranks as a staff business analyst with waterfall was a drawback - the more I became aware of the skills and underlying competencies needed to be a Business Analyst, I found that I was not strong enough in most of those skills.  Also I learn best by repetition and I never gain traction on how to write a user story because there was no repetition in what you were writing a user story for - every feature was something that never existed, so I felt I was starting from scratch every time."

This may vary based on business unit and project... as to how much or lack of process there is.

Salary is decent for the area but don't expect large raises. Your pay will remain relatively stagnant and like many others, you may end up tempted to move on to greener salaried pastures after your experience starts to eclipse your current pay rate.

TR likes to talk about Agile development and implementing new processes, but much of it is weakly implemented. Without a strong hand to force teams to use the new process, many just cherry pick (or ignore) what they want and things remain broken. TR 'Agile' is not true agile, it is more of a strange offshoot.

Seems to be hiring more contractors and less full-time employees, and not back filling empty positions as much. Might be an industry trend more than a hit against TR though.

In previous jobs I have always felt that my supervisor and manager were on the same team as me and that we had a common... goal. Not with this company. This rigid hierarchy has managers viewing themselves as part of `management royalty' and the staff workers as peons. This leaves a large disconnect between them and it hinders the work.

The work itself is broken down into small tasks and then any task that can be outsourced is. There is no ownership or autonomy given to staff. No 'thinking outside the box'. And yet every so often there will be a mandatory session where the workers have to show up to brainstorm ideas to help improve things. The message is: don't think outside the box until we tell you to, but even then, think inside the box we give you. The structure is set up to make the managers look like they are progressive and listening to their staff (but they are not)."

You can only survive here if you have sugar on your tongue and amul butter in pockets. You have to butter every manager on floor, even if you dont work. This will definitely work. Otherwise you are bound to get step-treatment. Factions,... groupism is common. Few people are bestowed opportunity to work on client sites. If you get this opportunity, take it and run.

Management has all been there 20+ years and just get moved around. Lots of layoffs... around me and not a lot of collaboration between teams. Takes 8 weeks to get a VM but management doesn't want to invest anything but the bare minimum in technology and only want opensource or very cheap applications/hardware.

The pay scale is very low when compared to similar jobs at other companies. When talent gets outsourced to India (and it does every few years), job security goes out the window and so does quality. It leaves the people who are left... with jobs to correct sloppy outsourced work. TR's favorite victims to lay off are the older folks without degrees, who have little to no hope searching for new jobs.

Finance often got payments wrong, and would take months to correct. If you... don't inspect every aspect of your comp, you will be shorted. Execs make product decisions with little input from the front line. No commitment to customers at all. If you're top 2% of sales then you will make money, along with the Senior Leadership team, only by way of screwing the rest of the sales reps and the clients. Lets face it- TR is in the business of buying and selling, not investing and improving products for their customers."

Total lack of career progression, especially for women or young parents (male and female) who settle for this company as it appears to be flexible with regards of working hours. In truth this is due to the aforementioned lack of ownership prevalent as an ethos that allows for so little accountability.
Total lack of transparency on some types of progression (typically business roles in London and in NYC which appear to be given out in a sort of secret anointment process away from the internal job portal or posted secretly for a couple of days)
A culture of internal self congratulation for ridiculous and pointless (and usually obsolete) product/initiatives ""delivered"" in to a market that is dominated and will be dominated by BBG.
Abysmal track record in closing any pay gap (between US and UK, between men and women, London and other offices, you name it)

Pantry's have some non-working old... aged vending machine (previously there used to be coffee day machines which they took off well no prize for guesses obviously due to cost cutting). It used to be a good company (before 2014) but NOT ANYTOME. so Please re-think of joining here.

"3518","A shell of the company it used to be. The culture has changed significantly.  The move is to outsource more and more.  The Legal business (TR's bread and butter) is barely growing. Management does not seem to know, care, or appreciate the skills employees bring to the table. They are quick to hire (and spend lots of money) on outside consultants when they have talent in-house.  Too many people who have been around a... long time - just biding time because they have a pension.  Motto is often, ""This is the way we've done it for years."""

"3524","The familiar problems with a large corporate environment. There are some very good people who know what they are doing, but also a misguided view that directors of a technology company don't need to understand technology. 

So they do things like requiring all the developers to take a truly awful security training replete with misinformation and incomplete explanations (based on techniques pioneered by Microsoft,... seemingly lacking the awareness that Microsoft doesn't exactly have a stellar record on security).

Or they'll find strange ways to save money, for example by abolishing all local IT support, and outsourcing it to IBM. Sure, they let the existing employees sign on at IBM, but the whole thing was awkwardly implemented and people on all sides were complaining.

Another problem is that they tend to be stuck in the typical corporate solutions. Since they have a universal site license for Oracle, why should they approve MongoDB for your project?

They also tend to be Windows-centric, though there are pockets of Unix awareness (and the unix people are very good)

The company would require you to pay back the difference of what they paid you at 150% and what your final average was for the year.  The company will come after you too even if you leave.  It is basically like getting a loan from the... bank without interest that you didn't ask for.  Word of advice if you go to Thomson Reuters.  Be mindful of the claw back.

There seems to be a specifically designed form(or few of them) for... anything you need to buy to release of new software product(in 2016, where everybody talks about shipping code fast and being agile)

Also, probably, the saddest - recent higher management decisions led to(or were intended to lead to) people to start leaving. Those, who start leaving are the ones, who will find the job easily(usually more experienced or more skilled), so the average skill level is getting lower and lower, which means that the product quality is going more and more down and this does not seem to bother anyone - everybody keeps speaking about that we'll do our best to deliver to the customer. Noone seems to understand that if colleagues that you respected and learned from start leaving - you think about leaving as well...

You can never... succeed here if you are remotely good as your managers consider you a threat and will only show your bad side to the upper Management who have blind faith in the managers. If you are seen as a threat to Managers in future or present you are shown in bad light to all.
Rumors spread faster than fire and are generally started by managers themselves. There is less work and more Gossip in LMS. People sit and chit-chat the entire day and to show upper management sit back late and work on weekends. People from certain states, speaking a certain language and of a certain ethnicity are given preference over others. They make you slog for the annual bonus dependent on the number hours you work and then they give you a poor rating on purpose to reduce the amount of money you should be earning.

- One day private cloud, next open stack, next AWS. These kind of moves within a short span of time are hurting a lot of team's productivity.

- Biggest issue: No... Trust between teams, every team has a dedicated engineer to make development workflow smooth for that team because there is no ops team to take this responsibility on. There are no self service tools that you can really use to easily deploy things to production. Your test deploy on dev and beta is very different from prod and often requires a person sitting on some other floor to approve a Change Request to push a button to deploy, when the dev actually does all the leg work.

- Get ready to be outsourced and downsized: My whole team was let go, my manager who worked for many years and colleagues with 8-10 years experience were let go. Biggest smack was a few of us were hired a few months back.  Although it was a business decision, which makes layoffs fair and nothing personal, it reflects lack of resource planning from top down when you fire people you hired months back. You can read about the layoffs in the news when their stock jumped in early November, 2016

But as the title says, I want to leave the company very soon and I'm only at my 5 months mark! (My probationary period lasts for 6 months, which I think is excessive. The job I do isn't even that hard to... be honest. My life and the tasks I did in school were a thousand time harder, please read on if you wanna know what kind of tasks I've been doing at this company for the past 5 months.)

I'm a software engineer who had imagined myself after graduation be doing something very creative and innovative. It's the reason I'd chosen to study CS in the first place. Unfortunately, all the projects here in Bangkok are soul-draining. All I've done so far consist of fixing stuff here and there and writing some documentation.. Seriously I don't see the value in my work at all. I studied for almost the past 2 decades of my life and I wanna grow up being an adult who does something that has a positive impact to this world. My current job now doesn't give me a sense of doing something that's impactful yet meaningful at all.
There're so many people around me who have been serving the company for 10 years or even more! I really doubt how they could do that with all these mundane tasks and a constant re-org. 

Only after 3 months my manager, some guys in my team and about a hundred of people from other business units at Bangkok site have been laid off. This is quite shocking to me as a new grad but I heard from my colleagues that this kind of thing really is no surprise here. Some of them even wish their names would be on the list next time. 

Wow the mentality of those who're with the company for so long is something me -- a Millennial -- cannot really stand. It's as if they've lost their passion. They lack the motivation and they're not easily adapt to new technologies that have been coming out. I'm sad that I'm so full of energy and passion to contribute to the company but I'm surrounded by people and filled with tasks that make it harder for me to wake up for work the next morning. I will admit that I want a corporate job because I thought it'd look good on my profile and that the company would have awesome projects for me to do and the tools that the company is using would be some of the most cutting-edge in the industry (beware here I'm not talking about the tools or products that company is producing). Oh and did I mention that the company or maybe just the Bangkok site? is still using the outdated MS outlook!!?

My manager also.. hmm he's a nice person who'd listen to everything I say but doesn't really take actions towards what I've requested. For example, I've asked many times for some basic financial training as I'd like to be more knowledgable about the industry that the company I'm working for is in. Then you guess it.. I haven't had any training thus far. 

Oh one last thing, the atmosphere and the setting of the office are really really dull. On my floor, it's super packed like there's really no room for creativity. If a representative of the company just passed by my comment, please tell this to someone who'd have the power to do something for the better for Bangkok site. 

Anyway, I think this is enough for ranting. I still wanna stay with company for the industry that it's in. I'm interested in this financial world .. maybe I'd need to move to other sites where there're more cool things in action? Or maybe I should just leave for a startup.."

"4413","I was with TR for over a decade. The cons are only related to working in IT for their Legal division. 

I left TR 3 years ago. I got out before the first wave of IT outsourcing layoffs hit my department. I cannot say anything bad about the company as a whole, but what I can say is that working in Legal (formerly West Publishing, St. Paul/Eagan, MN) was an interesting experience. The company was completely... different to work for before West Publishing was bought by Thomson, then later Thomson purchased Reuters until we have the conglomerate we see today. Since the merger I saw the company going downhillwages for employees were less than market average, benefits went downhill, the tuition reimbursement program was cut in half, then cut all together, hiring freezes, promotion freezes, and the discontinuing of the pension program for newly hired employees. TR also divested a large share of their money making divisionsThomson Learning and Thomson Health. I fear Thomson Legal will be divested soon as well because all of the signs of a failing division are present (see previous notes). Their legal division has been hurt by the failing print business. People do not read books anymore, they want information online. Their Westlaw product, while strong, could not keep up with the revenue enjoyed by their print business for decades. As the internet expanded, print subscriptions lessened. 
From an employee perspective, working at the Eagan, MN (former headquarters of the West Publishing business) location was typical to what you see in many Minnesota based companiesclickiness, ole boy club, subtle racism, and a definite glass ceiling for minority employees. Combine this with the poor financial outlook for this division and I would look elsewhere if you want a careeror even a job that is secure. Working in Eagan, MN was also the most toxic environment I have ever worked in. People were clicky, bigoted, back-stabby, untrustworthy, working in fear under authoritarian leadership models, non-supportive feckless HR, and you are getting paid less than other jobs in the same market. It is a no brainermeaning work here if you have no brain."
"4414","Usual problem of ""growing"" is its aim. Which is difficult when it isn't the #1 in its ex-Reuters marketplace. The company is also extremely silo-ed as a consequence."

"4421","- To save money, management has been systematically replacing work done by U.S.-based journalists with that done by junior reporters trained and based out of Bangalore.

"4557","The compensation may not be leading."
"4558","Where to start? The near-constant re-orgs are killing this place. It's obvious that the Thomson family regrets its acquisition of Reuters in 2008. They made a mistake buying a firm that was so dependent on the financial services industry at the precise moment that industry was beginning a 10+ year decline. They have global data collection operations that make it impossible to achieve the profit margins required to... make this an attractive acquisition though, so they've been hacking and slashing every few years, under the guidance of one major consulting firm or another. They've all been paid millions -- McKinsey, BCG, etc... -- even after David Craig began loading up senior positions with his consultant friends, who then began hiring all their friends from Oliver Wyman -- who are all great at generating Powerpoints and Excel sheets, not so much on delivering much of anything. Each major re-org (ca. every 3 years) requires a massive shift of attention and focus and ultimately drags motivation down. Nobody is ever held accountable for these horrendous decisions. The latest changes (smaller cuts in late 2015, large cuts late 2016) completely reversed the massive changes made in 2013. Does anyone realize how much time and energy was wasted trying to figure out the operating model from 2013? How much money this actually cost the company? C'mon, there must be at least one so-called ""strategy"" person who can crunch the numbers on this. Why not claw back some senior management bonuses as compensation for these losses? 

Financial & Risk has shifted to the ""ADD strategy"": shift focus and strategy every year, re-brand your efforts internally, generate a new batch of business cases aligned to the new strategy, and then arrive in the new year with the realization that there are not enough resources to deliver on the approved business cases. Everything stagnates. Late Q2 into Q3 it becomes clear that nothing is getting done, and then rumors of the ""new"" re-org start swirling. Play - Stop - Rewind - Play.....Repeat. Have a look on LinkedIn -- see how many people have changed roles every 12-18 months, repeatedly. That's not because they're being promoted based on performance. It's because there are repeated shuffles of strategy and how the organization should achieve it, followed by everyone scrambling to re-brand what it is they're doing to make it sound relevant (and central) to the new strategy. Yawn.

To go along with this, they've been systematically reducing the benefits across the board. They've fine-tuned the commission scheme for sales so that they can keep total payouts reduced, they've eliminated stock bonuses for anyone but the most senior managers, and they've keyed the cash bonuses to metrics that  also guarantee you'll never get full payout. It used to be the case that if your business unit over-performed (ie, exceeded already aggressive targets by 5-15%), those responsible for that were rewarded above your baseline rate. Now that might mean you get 90%-100% of your bonus rate. Actually -- not 100%. Never.

Wait a year and see if they've finally managed to sell off the Financial business, check to see they haven't taken David Craig along with the acquisition, and then see what they're doing. Going in now: you'd just be signing up for one long defensive crouch. And that's not a good way to live your life."

My much smaller company was acquired by Thomson Reuters many years ago, and along with benefits of a large company, there are definite downsides. You really are just a number in the grand scheme of TR.  Over the years there have been numerous rounds of layoffs and offshoring, and I've seen a lot of good people let go.  (On the flip side,... severance packages have generally been good for those employees that are laid off.)

My particular department has shifted from being a high expertise/leading edge content area to commoditized data, and the department has been shrunk and re-aligned numerous times, resulting in increased workloads. Not surprising, this results in lower morale and a bit of cynical attitude, while other priority departments and projects have received significant increases in resources.  That said, layoffs, reorganizations, imbalances in resources, etc. are typical at any very large company. 

Pay increases are minimal, with little flexibility to reward high performers or adjust pay for shifting responsibilities. (Only 1-2.5% each year for the past 10 years. ) Unless you move to a completely different position, you cannot simply renegotiate your salary with your boss.

"4858","Very demanding culture.  As employees leave the department, new positions would not be backfilled, ensuring more work for the OMS.  Large amounts of OT was necessary in order to complete work and to meet client needs.  OMS's with large account bases normally cannot go long periods of time without logging in remotely or in office due to the specific nature of account bases (and at irregular hours).  Difficult... work/life balance.   Working inter-departmentally was often a chore & does not always encourage positive relationships (as most departments had their own initiatives and goals, creating a check/balance system).  As an OMS, you work most closely with the sales team, whom (depending on who you work with) can create a less than memorable experience. Recent downsizing of departments made the work environment very competitive.  Upper management is very cliqe-ish, & your moving forward may very likely depend on their opinion of you vs your quality of work.  Ultimately, salary does not match the level of work the OMS must complete on a daily basis.  Career growth opportunities are limited unless you are willing to move to a new city or HQ.  Employees are encouraged to share new ideas, that either fall on deaf ears or Senior Management neglects to follow up on.  As an OMS, you will need to understand and access around 40+ systems internally, pending your task and what you need to accomplish.  Additionally, you are generally the first line of communication to your client, and you will need to help maintain that relationship  along with your long list of additional tasks.  Your experience as an OMS will depend on department needs, versus how you will grow best in your role (example: upon hire, you will join a team that needs you, due to downsizing and lack of replacing those who leave.  You may end up with a smaller account base in middle markets -- which is good for learning and growing -- or you could end up with a very high profile client where the learning curve is extremely steep, but with great exposure in your market)"

This permanently impacts on the sales team, as they are... uncertain as to their roles and become indifferent to trying to achieve anything. The systems and processes are so broken that achieving any internal admin tasks is a challenge, and makes the company very difficult to work with from a customer point of view. Its dreary spending every day trying to apologise for known issues, and those issues are never addressed.  The culture is better if you are a male, or identify as a male, for a female it was a challenge despite the supposed Women@TR, which only supported Women that were like those that ran Women@TR.

"5373","It is a daunting task to even start thinking of all the possible cons of having worked in EDD. Perhaps it was the department itself that deserves the lowest score, not so much the entire company. Perhaps. Although the bad impressions started early, even before my arrival to my new office. First off: I was flat out mislead during the recruitment process about the post-tax compensation, by about a third of the amount... I was promised per month. I was also mislead that the company is to provide help in finding housing and paying for certain other benefits like health insurance (they do pay it for you, entirely out of your salary!). But I guess these gimmicks have become commonplace. 

There were bigger issues involved within EDD: it is god-forbid disorganized. Mistakes, mistakes everywhere. From day one at relentless frequency, you will deal with errors and mistakes that come from nowhere and from noone in particular. I have worked in a number of offices before, and I could never have imagined that something so disorganized could still run without collapsing on its face. The management, which has been changed from bad to close to non-existent (perhaps, ironically, for the better), was simply not serious. When I did see the only manager come in, on an infrequent occasion, she seemed to have engaged in defending the structural problems that the department had rather than trying to fix them. On the one hand it is understandable that the manager tried to paint an ""optimistic"" picture of how things were, at the same time it is the crucial job of the manager to be able to see past any rosy optimist to figure out the weaknesses of department. It would have been a good start if she at least showed up to work consistently to figure things out. 

In terms of specifics of the issues that EDD suffered (and from what I hear, still suffers), these include: language issues in directions, constantly out of date database management, lack of teamwork, redundant administrative work that EVERY employee must pitch in irrespective if it comes in the middle of his or her other work (quite disruptional), lack of professional respect between both top and bottom, clique-type atmosphere, politics and feudal-style favouritism.  

I simply could not go on working at the place. It looked good on a CV, but the professional development was just too regressive."

It feels like they only care about the profit rather than actually investing in the employees and making the product better (fair enough to want profit, but investing first in the right places is... important). Its difficult to get around because it is just messy and you need to find things out on your own or with the help of colleagues due to the lack of guidance.

"5568","Thomson Reuters is a career cul-de-sac with advancement tied almost exclusively to tenure not talent nor competency. There is a reason there are so few employees in the 3-10 year range as most new employees are either laid off or leave due to lack of advancement opportunity, skill development investment (TR will rarely pay for certifications, technical conferences or outside learning) or regular re-organizations.  I... decided to leave the company when I realized they were paying me to become obsolete and the likelihood that I would be laid off without current skills was increasing each quarter. Thomson Reuters benefit package keeps most at the company so theres little motivation to do innovative work and its obvious many employees are just punching a time card.  On numerous occasions, long-tenured employees would simply not do their required work with little fear or repercussions yet still receive yearly salary increases and bonuses. As a new employee, expect to have to pick up the slack in order to receive a good performance review or prepare yourself to be laid off within 18-24 months (sometimes less depending on your department). Employees with innovative ideas are repeatedly ignored even when the ideas could save the company significant money. 
HR is a complete mess. Internal applications are lost or misdirected, job descriptions are altered to fit favorited candidates, position qualifications are wildly misaligned (a manager can be required to have more experience than a director within the same department), and internal advancement is nearly impossible without patronage. Nepotism is rampant  remember job descriptions and positions are often created to fit the background of leaders former business partners or coworkers. I personally witnessed this on multiple occasions despite HR requirements about diverse candidate boards and internal consideration. I was lied to, in writing, on multiple occasions by two different HR representative about internal opportunities yet my complaint to the HR ethics hotline went unanswered in both instances and the hiring leader for one position essentially shrugged their shoulders and informed me thats how HR is around here."

Year after year layoffs, and re-organizations over the past decade (and in many cases longer), and a constant perceived ""do more with less"" attitude from management, which makes for a extremely difficult environment to... work in at times, and has, in many cases, done much more harm than good for efficiency of the various businesses in the company.  Most employees I worked with can, without hesitation, name various tasks and processes that took minutes or hours to do, which now take days, weeks or months to complete.  From their perspective, it's due to so many experienced people being laid off from the company, and in a lot of cases, tasks being moved to a 3rd party, or being given to new hires right out of college who have no idea about the existing structure of the company, and are constantly recreating the processes over from scratch."

Too much bureaucracy, red tape, and worst of all, too many layers of management constantly changing course on strategy and impeding the progress of the actual do-ers. If you're the type of person who wants to work... 20 hours a week and take home a paycheck, then this is probably a good place to be at, but if you're really looking to grow your career with a flexible, fast-moving organization on the cutting edge of technology you will find it infuriating here."

New ideas for improvement were regularly criticized and you ended up feeling like it's just better to put your head down and accept the process as is.  Success there wasn't about the work you do but how well you can create a PowerPoint about the... work you do (truth in the PowerPoint is optional).  They also had a tendency to play musical chairs with leadership.  When things were going bad, the leadership would shuffle and it was billed as a ""new"" change to drive innovation.  The tone on this seems to be changing with the recent buy out but there's a lot of cultural change needed to undo the damage of the previous leadership.  Finally, there's a massive lack of transparency from leadership.  As an example, on one call, you'll be told the sales numbers are awesome.  Two hours later, you'll be in another call and the numbers were awful - usually that call related to setting expectations on  your bonus.  It was always a struggle to figure out how (and where) we were succeeding with the leadership taking constantly varied stances on performance."

For example, there were quite a few layoffs while I was there, with a couple of pretty disruptive outsourcing reorganizations. I assume supposedly to save payroll expense, but at what other... cost to the business in terms of lost knowledge and expertise.  

In recent years, the focus is on moving the entire company to an ""enterprise"" organization, creating enterprise shared services support groups, and trying to standardize systems and processes across many varied business units. Therefore, change can be slow b/c every project has to be considered in terms of how it fits into the enterprise plan.  I'm guessing certain specific departments and business units are able to respond to change more quickly and less bureaucratically.  But those are likely to be the outlying areas and not the areas that are central to the company's success.

So, in those core areas, there's been some pain and frustration with that. But they seemed to be getting there, and once they do I think they should be able to adapt and respond more quickly. But it's still going to be a pretty big ship to turn.  So, will have to see."

There is one God. And its name is Phone Queue, which for brevity we will now call Q. Your whole life will be structured around Q. Notice I say life, and not day. Q determines when you can leave work. Q determines when you can take PTO. Q determines if you get to work on the other projects/assignments you have. Q even has power over when you eat, which is ironic, as it is ever hungry. Q does not care if you vomit... on your coworker's desk or you have to take your spouse to the hospital. Q only cares about its daily pound of human flesh. Q can be merciful, but only if sated by the blood and tears of your fellow employees.


Ive been told there was a legendary time when program updates didnt break the software you are supporting. The documentation from that time is still recorded on the stone walls within the smokers gazebo, chiseled in Ancient Sumerian. I think we were allowed to wear shorts back then, too.


Some managers are better than others. This is common in all companies, but it does seem that some employees end up getting fired who would have made it on other teams. Ive heard of insane micromanaging where every blip of inactivity is questioned and others have allegedly been cussed out, but I never experienced that personally. 


This job is often touted as a foot in the door for the rest of the company. This is solely dependent on our Dear Leader, Q. I saw multiple reps with applicable skills who got offered internships/opportunities in other departments get denied because Q couldnt afford to let them go. In one of those scenarios, the rep knew only one product at the time so they would have only impacted one part of Q out of 20+ parts. This implies to me that these dangled opportunities will rarely happen. The foot in the door metaphor would be more accurate if they added if pigs fly, or even better, change the phrasing to a foot in your rear to help you out the door. In the company's defense, I understand the business reasoning behind not letting reps work in other departments, but the majority of those reps I mentioned earlier left and got jobs in their field at different companies after 2+ years of training at the company's expense. Such a waste. 


There is a high ceiling for advancement in this department. It is not impossible and once youve broken your chains, it gets easier to keep doing so. But just realize you will be competing against 50+ internal people per job posting. Its not uncommon for someone completely unexpected (ie. theyre rather new) to get chosen for a role, but this would be a negative for the people who dont get the job and have based their entire career on getting to that position. This is balanced by situations where they already have someone in mind for the role, but tell all the other applicants that they stand a good chance so they can get enough applicants to have the illusion that this was an unbiased process. This leads to a two week to two month process of interviewing where theyll still go with the person everyone knew was going to get the job in the first place. These very common scenarios create a lot of uncertainty and resentment about promotions in the department which is channeled towards the company. The salt in the support department is real, and no amount of free food or lego stations can wash it away. To be fair, the interview process has always been inherently broken. You cant tell if an applicant is going to be good at a role after looking at a piece of paper inflating their accomplishments, having a 45 min conversation where you ask about hypothetical scenarios that may or may not be relevant to the role, and where you get answers that may not even be true and cant be verified. Its absurd, and its best to revel in that absurdity. Otherwise youll lose your mind and start throwing coins into the urinals and wiping your snot on the bathroom walls. (The chaotic interview structure is probably common in other companies as well, but I dont know if Thomson Reuters should be proud to be a part of that swamp.)


You need to make a plan for what you want from the company as soon as possible. Not all product knowledge is valuable and applicable to other jobs. After mastering the customer service soft skills there is not much left to learn except for additional products. The issue is that these additional products will not necessarily help you advance to other parts of the company. It may help with some product specific roles and it will help you advance in the Support department, but if your interests lie elsewhere then its not worth it. Learning as many products as possible seems like a good way to get ahead. This is a trap. You will have a less flexible schedule with more stress for the same pay as everyone else. There is not one job that requires that many product knowledge bases (possibly Training/Consulting but even then I doubt you would be supporting everything). Those with IT aspirations should learn GFR, Web, and all the Systems. Those with an eye on a Development role should look at what products will have the most demand, generally a tax product or products in development. Professional Services tends to find more value with people who know GFR. Getting into the Operations or Content team requires some experience doing their work/job duties, which is only offered to those with passable metrics and product knowledge, and manager approval. Sales will look at anyone with some experience with sales. The reason this section is in the Cons, is that your manager or Operations can throw you into a training at-will, which can derail your career plan or give you irrelevant work which gives you less time to do things that will actually have an impact on your future. I see perfectly good reps with solid metrics start to flounder when they get overburdened or disillusioned. These reps usually leave in any way possible (ie. MyPay). 


A silver bullet mentality. Everything looks like a nail when you just got a hammer. This is especially apparent with the companys attempt to turn every team into one based around Agile. Agile makes more sense in an Agile role where there is a finished Agile product rather than in a call-center environment. If I had heard the word Agile one more time, I was going to Agile myself out the second floor window. But the big man in the big chair championing the system said that this will allow the company to save more money and stop the hemorrhaging of the department, so obviously they are an informed, innovative thinker. You could also try sending him your credit card information and social security number and hell send you back a routing number for a Nigerian bank. Expect to hear industry buzzwords all the time with people nodding their head in excitement. But dont look into anyones eyes when they do it. Theyll be black and lifeless, like a dolls eyes.

Constant reorganization. As soon as employees begin to feel ""settled"" after a major change, another huge change happens.

All of these huge changes continue to happen, but everything employees suggest to management gets ignored. Morale is low."

Certainly things get lost and you've got to make sure you know how to get them done yourself and not give up.   As in any organization, there are people who just clock in and make themselves look busy - identify those people right away and figure out how to get around them.   Lots of systems here - and changing day-by-day."

But when you treat the work force like expendable assets, experience and decades of service count for nothing, youre just replaceable, so dont speak up. Targets increased to levels where nobody can achieve them, the work load has increased and no bonuses for the sales teams or lower... management.

* Addicted to major reorganizations every Q4 (though last year's may have been big enough to hold off for a year)
* Keeps trying to define one single message for the entire gigantic corporate entity (answer company! no, we're a software company! no, we're a platform company!) when no one outside the company cares

Its sheer disgraceful to share that the kind of people that are being hired after new management arrived are totally worthless. Infact the MD at India operation is hiring people from his family who does not have enough experience... for the relevant post.

The information that the Indian Management Team is sharing to the thomson reuters head office Management Team is utterly fake which is also not being verified by the 
thomson reuters head office Team. Indian Management is sacking people from its team without giving any intimation to the people by giving fake data to thomson reuters head office Management where no actions are taken by thomson reuters head office Management. Till now Indian Management has forcefully asked two people to resign from the company who are very senior people in the system. One of them is 9 years old and another is 6 years old in the system."
