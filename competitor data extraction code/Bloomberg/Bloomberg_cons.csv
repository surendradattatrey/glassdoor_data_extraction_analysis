"1","Bloomberg was a great place to work a few years ago.  However in the last few years it has become increasingly bureaucratic.  It has lost the vision and zeal of its founder, Michael Bloomberg.  Today the same creativity and boldness that Michael Bloomberg encouraged is no longer an asset, in fact, it is discouraged.  The user interface for its primary product is dated."
"2","the hours are too long and it is expected that you 'go the extra mile' often. Holidays are rubbish. Some of the work due to the technologies used can be repetitive, and often you don't have time to do the job properly. Some of the people you have to deal with on the business side are clueless."
"3","long hours, too much pressure for the money you get; ""pushing"" all the time from the management; unbearable"
"4","incompetent managers - don't know how to manage people. have no experience in managing people. reluctance to take risks and eager to pass the responsibility and fall out to other people - no ownership of development or direction of business."
"5","Difficult to grow as its such a huge organization. Not much learning  happens, unless you spend a lot of time at the firm and proactively try to learn stuff. Job as such wont teach you much. Sad to say this, but the image of this company is overhyped outside. Most of the time you are actually doing backend, boring and monotomous jobs (with the possible exception of some of the sales guys)."
"6","Very nasty people, close-minded bully management"
"7","Ethically void.  A/C and Heating are unstable.  If your boss is harassing you, and you tell their boss and HR, YOU will be written up (but still given a bonus).  Management is incompetent (promotions based on the ability to brown nose, not actual ability to do/learn/improve anything aside from staying in same position for 8 years)."
"8","There is little flexibility in terms of people's roles. The company has grown so fast that it is no longer as entrepreneurial as it used to be. It is incrementally innovative but never fundamentally innovative. The culture seems to prize the amount of hours employees spend at the terminal as opposed to the quality or originality of ideas they contribute. Loyalty is also paramount."
"9","Long hours, some of the technology in use is truly awful (although in recent years this has improved tenfold, so there is now a mix of OK and very bad)."
"10","The biggest downside is that the company is divorced from Silicon Valley and its ways, making it hard for former Bloomberg employees to return to greener pastures. The projects are effectively managed by the sales organization, which is eager to please the customers often making impossible promises, rushing projects and asking for shortcuts left and right. As a result, the code is chaotic and archaic, and in bad... need of huge rewrites and lots more testing.

Some of the projects are ill-conceived from the start; several projects in my team that took months to develop received little or no use from customers, and the salesperson that asked for the feature, having signed up the client, has no interest in pushing your product.

Your experience varies significantly depending on who your immediate manager is; it may very as far as the flexibility of your workday - some managers expect you to be at work no later than 9:00 and some others recognize that the flexibility to choose, within reason, what time you come to work in the morning, will affect your output."
"11","Sub-average compensation, limited management opportunities, strategy not always explained by senior management, management often not willing to pay competitively for superior talent, management skills not always valued compared with technical skills"
"12","In IT(or R&D as we call it) the scope for growth is limited because of the flat hierarchical structure. Also the managers nor the company takes much active interest in employee's professional growth. also the work can get boring sometimes."
"13","The company is very ""metrics driven"".  Many of the jobs are very stressful and tedious.  Management has little trust in its employees.  And for a modern company, they are not accomodative to employees who seek work-life balance.  Career opportunities are primarily in the company's New York HQ.  Employee morale is very low since Mike Bloomberg has left to be mayor of New York.  The company is very youth oriented.  I... have seen few employees over 40 promoted or treated well.  There is a hidden, and at times overt, atmosphere of hostility toward older employees.  All employees are expected to fit the ""Bloomberg mold.""  There is little tolerance for individual differences....  Finally, management is quick to point out shortcomings, but rarely praises things that are done well."
"14","Sort of a sweatshop. If you're not careful, you might get lost in it; big corporation, hiring process is slow."
"15","Ancient architecture, no coding standards, no commenting of code, no documentation, poorly designed and documented, buggy, incomplete GUI framework which you are forced to use, weird UI standards, little inter-group code sharing, poor common tools"
"16","Utter stifling of creativity and innovation. You're required to detail all time spent in programmers notes. Try putting in some notes about thinking about the big picture! It would be comic if not sad that humans are expected to work and act as automatons -- and dumb automatons at that, impervious to the fact they're being talked down to at every minute. I've watched really smart people who needed the money become... shadows of their own selves. Oh and not to mention: the technology is antique."
"17","stifles creativity, work is repetitive. there is little coaching and professional development from higher ups. you can get easily stuck in a box covering the same thing over and over again, and find yourself writing the same stories five years later. When i left to go to a newspaper I had more experiences in a month than I did reporting for a year and a half in this office"
"18","There is very little upside to working at Bloomberg.  The compensation system is nowhere near ideal, as your bonus for this year is paid out in the following year, to ensure that you stay at the company.  Mobility is extremely limited, and it seems that the company has been moving backwards ever since Bloomberg left the company to become mayor."
"19","The salary is quite bad considering the industry and what Bloombergs competitors pay. Managers are often incompetent, too young and obviously never received any kind of management training. Therefore (salary) reviews and promotions are based on managers preferences and not on your actual performance. 
There seems to be a huge divide between people that have been hired in the last 5 years and those that have been... there longer. The senior staff seems to be paid well which results from the much better salary levels they had under Mike Bloomberg (or so they say) and then there are the younger ones, many of those leave the company after less than 2 years..."
"20","Long long long hours.  Managers that have no management skills. A lot of arrogant, and no goods to back it up.  If you need to go to the doctors or dentist, you have to take a vacation day.  I worked there for over a year and I have never seen more people wheeled out by the ambulance than any where else. People pass out of exhaustion from working there."
"21","- No emphasis on software design - entire mentality is focused on getting the job done as quickly as possible.  
- Managers actually discourage you from spending too much time designing code!  
- A lot of legacy code that is poorly written with no documentation
- Management is very set on their ways
- TONS of proprietary software
- Lack of professional development. 
- Most likely will not learn much regarding... software development...but you might learn a lot about finance"
"22","Allegedly flat structure could not be further from the truth; in reality, an entry level employee gets to look forward to 15 people telling him or her what to do."
"23","The turnover is very high because there are few possibilties to reach power within the division. Structure is too flat"
"24","The pay... below market rates generally. The starting rate hasn't been changed in over 10 years - that is a fact. I think 5-10 years ago, pay reviews etc were fantastic, but since hierarchy has had a reshuffle, they've cut back in a big way in this area... i can only remember 1 or 2 people employed in the last couple of years who were happy with their pay reviews"
"25","Management did not lead intelligently, although the company still grew and prospered"
"26","Work is not intellectually stimulating, especially if you are in sales. From what I hear, the compensation is confusing, and the room to move up is political."
"27","- They use very old Technology (Fortran and C)
- Everything Homegrown and Proprietary and doesnt work well. Infrastructure is full of Bugs.

- Long Long Working Hours often pushed by Managers.
- No recognition for Hard work.
- Proprietary DB/UI framework everything is from Stoneage and full of bugs... making Programmers life a Hell.
- Hectic Work Env."
"28","Pay isn't that great. The fact that it is so transparent can be a negative for some people"
"29","Direction is unclear. There are many of gray areas working at Bloomberg. Compensation for over work and stress is not recognized enough. But in the end it all works out. My previous employer was the US Navy and it operated worse than Bloomberg."
"30","The technology is ancient (the majority). A lot of programmers are simply maintaining legacy code (fortran, c) that cannot be retired or converted. The company also uses a TON of proprietary software, all developed in-house. For example, they've created their own Service oriented architecture (ala WSDL), two home-grown databases, entire UI framework, and other things."
"31","If you enjoy working with the jaded, the condescending, the incompetent, come on down!  Not all management is bad but incompetence is tolerated...."
"32","The lovely view can often be distracting from work. Some of the technology often feels outdated. Server architecture and build process are baroque."
"33","Long hours / clocking hours

Micromanagement
Obsolete technologies
Open space office
Ridiculous business ever-changing policies towards employees"
"34","Allegedly flat hierarchy, but in essence the place operates as a bunch of warring fiefdoms. Compensation formulas are bizarre and based on totally unrealistic goals. A lot of green, i.e. young, managers who pay absolutely no attention to the long-term goals. Managers in particular are risk averse to the point where you're relegated to cutting and pasting the same code over and over again ""because it's been in... production for a year."" 

Young workforce gleefully works 12 or 14 hour days, which becomes the dominant paradigm so those who want a balanced life or at least a parent for the child need to a stay-at-home significant other. What said young workforce has in enthusiasm, cloying hyperbabble, and comfort with the cult of Bloomberg they lack in depth of knowledge. They talk quickly, and generally know answers to specific questions, but don't understand systems from the runtime environment all the way down to bare metal. 

Management actually get angry if you question design decisions or spend time cleaning up code. Expect to be micromanaged and constantly berated with a stern ""Why are you doing that?"" at least ten times a day. 

The HR department is a travesty. The ""Bloomberg"" recruiters are contractors who then find other contractors. If you work as a contractor, expect absolutely no follow-up on questions to HR and to never, ever be able to get in touch with HR people, particularly the ""senior"" contracted HR recruiters. Like normal HR, they strive to keep the best talent out and consistently work half days. You're stuck trying to figure out even simple things for yourself. Basically, if you think for yourself, aren't willing to march to orders no matter how irrational they are, and have talent, you'll either be turned down or shown the door quickly with the Scarlet Letter rendering you unfit to ever work at Bloomberg again. HR is also very secretive and getting straight answers for important decisions is wasted effort. I've also heard stories that certain HR recruiters will lie in order to steer business toward specific vendors -- this is just speculation."
"35","Too big to be recognized for your individual work - unless you make it a point to flaunt your achievements.  Since the company is so big people tend to be overly and unnecessarily competitive in looking out for themselves rather than focusing on the team goals."
"36","unchallenging, unprofessional management, not meritocratic - more a case of being in the right place at the right time, no time for management due to relentless targets"
"37","Poor pay, no real management/promotions structure, only prvide breakfast (no lunch?), repetitive, slow paced. I am biased because I should be in a bank instead."
"38","GTEC, ADSK, and GCUS are perhaps the worst departments in the company. Workforce is generally young and immature. However, there are some really smart and ambitious people working there."
"39","Brutal hours.  People die here from overwork.  Be prepared to work 14 hour days and weekends. Utterly ossified management, micromanagement, downright harassment, brutally invasive oversight.  Zero flexibility on rules, hours.  Complete contempt for employees, no credit for ideas. Incredibly bad design, obsolete technology."

"49","4 weeks of vacation, but working 12 hours on one day and 7 hours on another isn't enough (8 and 8 works though). Not enough feedback from management. Business/sales people are often responsible for big decisions. They don't have any sense of what kind of resources a project will take. People working here for 10 years are doing the exact same thing as recent university graduates. The work environment sucks with just... lines of desks and no vision/noise blocking devices; if you sit next to a manager, expect to have conversations/debates going on at all times. If you sit next to one of the projectors broadcasting announcements on the wall, expect to be distracted by flashing text every 5 minutes. Antiquated system architecture, and frequently broken development tools. Free food is good, but it's all chips, candy, and sodas, with few healthy options."

"53","CONS

They will mold you at their convinience
Work 2 years, try to get move to a more interesting department, or don't work in the NY office (really bad enviorment to work for)"
"54","Development is panic or bugfix driven, so you won't get time to plan or improve. Have that development style for 30 years, and this is the root cause of the other cons:

There is no project management to speak of.
The build process is time consuming and not automated.
The technology is old.
You can download freely available libraries/tools that are better than what's mandated internally."
"55","Work is not really challenging.
Lots of repetitive work.
Need to fill out programmer's notes every day.
If you're a programmer and you hope to learn more about finance by working here... it won't happen.
If you're an intern, you cannot bill more than 40 hrs per week. Almost everybody works more, but you won't be paid for overtime.
Free food and drinks are always there, but if you're health conscious, most of it... won't be of much benefit to you.
IB - ""Instant Bloomberg""  - instant messaging for Bloomberg employees - can get in the way of work.
Old technology."
"56","NO cubicle, though common in NYC. If you are used to a typical computer industry job, you probably feel under a little tighter control with BB."
"57","1) no flexible time.
2) very long hours (9-6 manditory...though they won't admit it).  take lunch or don't, you must be there for 9 hrs at least.  and that's a short day.
3) project management is a joke.
4) proprietary technology and outdated.
5) forget finding another job.  yuo'll forget what you know in about 3 months and won't be able to put anything on your resume.
6) they like to hire fresh graduates so... they can mold them to their culture."
"58","Technology is amazingly OLD. Do you konw comdb? 
Managers don't care your feelings as long as you get the work done regardless how you achieved that.
For an intern, whether you can get a fulltime job offer is independent on how your work was during summer even if you work hard and your mentor and manager like you."

"62","Bad pay. Unclear career structure. Bad perks. long days.  Bad variety in job. Bad training resources. shifting focus from management all the time."
"63","Management is always promoted internally, hence lack of management skills and training. Work is the same everyday, no variation whatsoever."
"64","Terrible place to work if you're interested in good software. If you're fortunate enough not to be working on Fortran or some really old crappy C code, you still have to put up with an infrastructure that is from the 90s, maintain some ugly patchwork code. Everything is run based on unreasonable demands from business folks who don't understand software and you are constantly writing band aid solutions and patching... code. Your software engineering skills will suffer. Most of the management (on the tech side) doesn't know what it takes to be a good leader and is interested in hitting project deadlines dictated by the business at any cost without any regard for employee development. The only people who can be happy working there are people who started working there out of college, have only seen this culture, and are happy at being well compensated. You will not be happy if you've seen the world outside those glass walls. Do NOT go there as a senior engineer."

"81","Code base is old and can be frustrating at times. Core technical people, who want to develop their technical skill set will be put off by the demand to get the solution out to customers, often sacrificing quality. If you're in a team that works on legacy products rather than new ones, the skills you pick up will be in proprietary techs that are not transferable. The flat hierarchy, (3 levels from new... fresh-from-college hire to the head of R&D) may not leave room for advancement that you can show on your resume."

"84","Salary is not competitive at all which is very demotivating. Career prospects are poor and senior management have not been trained in leadership at all. Working hours are NOT flexible. You often feel like working in a factory and all that is important is statistics before quality. It doesn't feel like management cares about you at all which is bad for moral and team spirit. Lastly, Bloomberg is known for having a... very flat structure which is not really true. Even people used to working in investment banks say that Bloomberg's management structure is more hierarchical than those in banks. Unless you know the right people in the US it is very difficult to get a say in anything."

* There... are no separate cubical so everybody can see everybody else.. and environment is little noisy so becomes hard to concentrate.
* Managers are rude, don't respect team members.. good work won't get appreciation ever.. (and this is a culture.. this is not about specific manager).
* Top management have completely failed in managing software capital.. lot of code duplications.. software pieces are scattered here and there and there is no track of it.. often you will be writing a module from scratch even though its available somewhere else.

They just want you to churn more software out, as fast as you can.

And of course there is nothing called 'testing'. Its the developers... job of course. And you still have to get things out there 'in time'."
"101","It feels like college again, with all the metrics/testing- not a good determinant for quality employees.

It's an irony when we... say alot of times we feel really hungry given that the Bloomberg pantry is just there - but you don't get the time to go because you're SO BUSY and you cannot afford to leave your desk for lunch etc.
MICRO MANAGERS are everywhere in Analytics, they ask ""where are you"" 100 times a day, we have to report to our managers when we go to the toilet, go for lunch, to get a drink or just to run downstairs to meet the deliveryman - they want to know EVERYTHING about you.
Sometimes they will ask you to go to the toilet and come back ASAP. :(
Asia Analytics managers do not protect their subordinates when it comes to a complaint by a client or even internal employees - in other words the Analytics representative is ALWAYS in the wrong no matter what - treated like dirt.
Asia managers are too weak and incompetent compared to their NY/LO counterparts.
Evaluation of employees is a joke - simply put - they award money to whoever they like and not to the people who actually performed well.

First thing they don't have good and deeper technical knowledge as they don't necessarily have all basic computer science background and understanding of product as whole. Having knowledge just about a language (like C/C++) is not same as having actual product... development knowledge. Second thing since they are straight out of college they don't  have any outside experience and they feel that they do the amazing work while actually its not the case.  Also they are just too random/impetuous and irresponsible in their decisions.These guys just tend to make their Evals/Compensation better by making their team members to work the way their managers expects from them. Nowhere in all this, actual product development is been given more importance. They give more importance to the actual no.of hrs worked on rather than the efficiency and output. Also here more importance is given to number of bugs fixed, rather than actually finding the root causes and reducing the number of bugs generated in first place. That's the reason why sometimes its more of a mechanical work/mechanical temporary fixes than a good, challenging work which requires talent. These team leads don't give any credit to the team members who actually work on, but rather will try to explain their contribution in any good thing the members do.
Its hard for smart/talented computer science people to strive in the company. The company just needs to maintain their random codebase by keep on adding new things without any good design, introducing new bugs in existing thing, fixing them to introduce something new.....  one day that can end up beyond repairable !!"

"167","-A incongruous maze of workflow management tools that are ineffective and self defeating due to their inadequacies which the company compensates for with added bureaucracy and ill-thought-out policies rather than changing the system they concocted and implemented with home grown software.
-Managers are often abusive towards subordinates both systemically as well as interpersonally and such behavior is tolerated and... almost seems encouraged.
-Managers are often promoted/selected on the basis of who has been there the longest and not in consideration of any actual ability to manage or lead.
-Programmers are permitted to behave in defensive and accusatory ways towards systems and internal-end-users whenever questions about their product arise.
-Employees at large are often treated as though they are attempting to take advantage of the company and policies are issued from senior management that are both heavy handed as well as indicative of a general distrust of the average rank-and-file employee.
-The technology here is old hat, and there are a lot of in-house solutions that won't help you acquire skills that are at all portable in the marketplace.
-Expectations of herculean efforts are common place and the hero mentality is prevalent; working 50, 60, 70 etc... hours per work is considered to be the sign of a good, great, incredible, etc...  employee.
-The method used to actually gauge an employee's value to the company, and in turn determine their compensation, is highly subjective and usually left to a team leader who is frequently biased.
-Review process does not allow an employee to respond to or refute any claim of underperforming or failing to meet goals -- these claims can and do affect the final review and in turn compensation.
-It is common place for the rank and file in R&D to be kept in the dark about upcoming projects and changes/additions to the overall technical environment until it is their turn to ""do X"" and even then said employee is still clueless about what is going on.
-The company does not encourage learning about the industry in operates in. Training is made available through ""Bloomberg University"" (aka BU), but at no point does the company encourage or require an employee to learn anything about what the financial services industry is or how it works.
-Policies are applied to R&D, if not the firm, in a blanket fashion; but it is not uncommon for these policies to be contrary to the common good of selected groups that must now adhere to such rules.

There are no cubicles, only an open expanse of desks. Things get noisy, so it's hard to concentrate much of the time and anyone can see what's on your computer... screen. The environment is such that you always feel like you're being watched and controlled. Your clock-in and clock-out times are prominently displayed on the Bloomberg terminal when someone searches for you. There is a culture of working long hours and while you get lots of vacation time, there are subtle ways where it's implied that you shouldn't be taking vacation.

Teams don't necessarily have any incentive to work with each other. If you're put on a project and have to work with another team, sometimes the managers can get protective of their turf.

Bloomberg hires people young, lets them move around, but never bothers to pay them. Almost universal dissatisfaction with pay (with the exception of management) leads to lots of people getting their experience at Bloomberg and then going elsewhere to actually make money. Bloomberg... really is a very nice place to work but if pay is one of your top concerns you WILL be disappointed."
"191","If you are a person who likes to be an independent contributor, technologically focused and be given some free reign on your projects -- actually, I'll go out on a limb to say that if you are a decent programmer, who expects a disciplined approach to programming (most of the code is haphazard and difficult to maintain) -- this company may not be for you.

Bloomberg has a lot of ridiculous bottlenecks that would... make any sane programmer cry with agony. I'm not understating this, you can get the hints from all the reviews up there before mine (at the same time, I'm surprised at some of the 4 and  5 ratings here!). These bottlenecks/annoyances are not just in your day-to-day development, but while you are in the building too. 

The badge-in/badge-out, the security making rounds around the office who stop you and sternly ask to wear your badge -- even while you are just going to get a coffee in the damn pantry (I've had to literally go back to my desk to get it), I encourage you to visit the premises talk to existing employees beforehand and get an idea of what you are getting into. 

No proper cafeteria area to eat your food -- the running joke was that the bigwigs expect you to eat at your desk and thus you will be around your desk to be called upon by your manager/peer during that time.

Very little transparency, things just happen without prior knowledge,"
"199","Bloomberg has tons and tons of legacy code, mostly in Fortran and C, and to add insult to injury, it's rarely commented/documented/explained in any shape or form -- when you make a function call, you often enter magic land. While there are no new Fortran files (company policy), you will almost certainly have to at least look at lots of Fortran in debugging it, and you may need to make code additions for bug fixes....
Bloomberg is a fast paced company (due to it being driven by Finance), but this means that you focus on getting the final product done ASAP -- which can be exciting -- but rarely will you get the chance to take time and properly design and develop a product, or refactor old code that, while not technically broken, is inefficient."
"200","Technology is extremely proprietary.  You're not working with open source technology, or even Microsoft tools.  You're working with Bloomberg specific technologies, many of which date back to hacky solutions from the early 80s.  A lot of the new stuff is poorly documented and in a constant state of flux.  I often am jealous of my friends who get to work with more interesting technology, even though I'm better... compensated.  The management is a bit lacking.  The structure is very loose (which can be a good thing), but sometimes things feel disorganized.  They don't employ any software methodologies or process, so even though they use rapid development, projects are poorly organized and lack planning and testing.  This also can make projects more stressful than they need to be."
"201","Management not supportive of international employees in their visa applications and green card applications. They try to exploit people who need sponsorship."
"202","jobs are relatively easy and do not require too much analystical skills."
"203","This company, though mainly based on the the main terminal software, can never become a true software development company. And the worst part is management don't have the vision to see this happening. This is mainly because most of the middle management (team leads) is filled with people having no development experience apart from bloomberg itself and that too a lot of non-computer science people. What senior... management should understand is that there is a subtle difference between just programming and actual software development. Anyone from any background can learn programming or a language/scripting within a short frame. However that does not necessarily indicate that they can develop a good software. Unfortunately people here don't understand this. And since the leadership at technical level has these major lacks, the company is loosing key talents at the developer level who are never allowed/given chance for good development techniques due to middle layer (Mainly because leads have never done that and they just want their juniors to follow what they say). Eventually good developers will leave the company and go to a better place. No compensation/other benefits can stop this happening, but just the cleanup of the middle layer. That's precisely the reason the software isn't that great enough, just that its still in  market because it does not have real software company as a competitor in Financial Markets. The day isn't far when companies like google, ms seize this opportunity and bring better financial software to market, which will definitely put company in a lot of trouble"

I was even asked by other departments to not let him/her near them because he/she didn't know what they were talking about and made everything worse. Operating system was extremely archaic and instead of using technology that was already out there the company instead... spent millions of dollars trying to make their own mediocre devices. Many ""star"" employees were hired because they were FOM - Friends of Mike - and were paid exorbitant salaries while dragging down the entire business. They would let go and outsource entire departments without any warning at all. Due to the use of only their operating system and their devices if you stay at the company for more than 2 years you are deemed unhireable by other companies because you have been ""bloombergized""- you pretty much lose your entire skill set unless you go home after work and study...which is what I had to do before I left."

"236","Remuneration is low for the location.  Bonus awards come in the form of equity which is given with an estimated value and allowed to mature for a year, then they're cashed out based on actual value.  Don't expect high award amounts either, there's a lot of expensive tropical fish to feed and by God they always come first.  Low-level management has a great deal autonomy, far beyond most workplaces.  Mid and high... level management is ok and is mostly composed of professional folks, but they don't do any dirty work - it's the low-level managers who do, and they can be prima donnas, especially if they have an axe to grind.  For that reason, brown-nosing is rampant through pretty much every department and you'll find a lot of folks eager to drink the Bloomberg cool-aid just to keep their jobs because they live in fear.  If you get along with your boss, you'll be ok - however, if you don't and he or she has got it out for you, they'll make your life impossible in every way they can until you're fed up, or just fire you outright.  When this happens, treatment of employees is often arbitrary and conflicts come up over trivial things - by which I mean that you'll be singled out for 'performance issues' while other people sit at their PCs and play fantasy football all day and not even get a talking to.  Your job description might also change to demand you get skills you didn't need before - either because someone else got fired, or because of a new responsibility placed on the department which might be similar or related to your career path. Bloomberg has an internal computer-based learning system with many courses free of charge, but should your new responsibilities require skills that fall outside of training that is internally offered, you'll find you will not get anything beyond a list of local training centers offering the course or certification you'll need to get a good review.  On the job training is nonexistent, because those who do have the knowledge are too busy to handhold those who don't until they get the hang of their new responsibilities, at least beyond the most basic aspects.  Employees are generally responsible to pay for any out-of-house training if their job description changes for any reason, which must be done outside of work hours.  Don't expect any loyalty from anyone in management - everyone is replaceable at the drop of a hat, no matter their past contributions.  But it feels like all of the above is a very well-put together management style, because it's so consistent across departments.  Like for example the fact that no one in the building has an office, it's all an open floor plan and the most anyone might have is a glass-segregated seating space.  So, bottom line, the company's not for everyone."
"237","Most of the senior management have their positions solely because they joined Bloomberg from the beginning. They do not have a lot of exposure and experience of rest of the world and are not very competent in management and technology and unfortunately they also have a lot of authority and ego. This causes miss-treatment towards  lower level staff and policies that don't make a whole lot of sense. If one does not... gel well with the management layer, no matter how competent you are, you career and salary will not progress that far."

"248","Don't expect compensation to match that of financial services. Job can get quite mundane after some time. Very little resources set aside for personal development or team building activities."
"249","Lots of incompetent people being promoted to managers--those who scream the loudest or just because they were good developers or got lucky (every other senior person left the team), but it doesn't mean they make good managers. It is as very easy to be demoted (as part of a reorganization, etc, I haven't seen it to happen as much in other companies). Unfortunately the incompetent managers always seem to stick around,... it is the good managers which usually suffer.

 R&D (programming dept)  uses a lot of ""in-house"" technologies, and public/mainstream technologies which it uses are technologically way behind other companies. There is still lots of C and Fortran code to deal with. New development is done in Javascript (not web based), and C++, but the company switched to C++ only about 5 years ago, and to Javascript about 3-4 years ago when everyone has done it decades ago. The more you stay in the the company , especially if you stay in one of R&D groups which doesn't deal with financial instruments directly, the less marketable you'll become shall you decide to leave the company.

The pay is above average for Junior developers, but tapers off once you become a Senior Developer. After discussing this with my friends in the company over the years, it almost feels like you hit some kind of a glass ceiling after 8-10 years in the company, unless you are a superstar (which means you have no personal life), some kind of a a genius, become a manager, AND have enough marketing stills to market yourself to your manager before your annual review.

Theoretically, the company has ""work from home"" policy now and some flexible work programs. But it practice, it has policy has been very limited and mostly used by middle-chain managers.

Lots more pressure on developers once the company instituted the ""Plan B"" reorganization, sometimes it's way too much.

 That said, everything totally depends on the team you're on. Even within the same group in R&D,there are good teams where developers are happy and stay for years, while in other groups developers are buried with work and work 12 hours a day until they transfer to a different team or quit."
"250","Random promotions / some unfair treatment. Expectations are not clearly defined."
"251","Like the other programmers pointed out, it is a dead end for senior developers.  Bloomberg uses proprietary technologies.  Your skills would become obsolete and irrelevant to other companies in 2~3 years.  If you plan to just get some experience and add a line in your resume, this place is definitely a good place to start.  If you have plan to stay for long term, think again.  Bloomberg used to offer generous... compensation packages and take care of loyal employees.  But since Mike left for New York City Hall, the culture has changed.  Loyalty is less important than profitability.  If you get stuck for more than 5 years and still don't get chance to move up the ladders, then you should definitely consider moving to other companies before it becomes too late for you to brush up your fading skills and memory from college."

"277","Let me preface this by saying that if one of the 'pros' above works for you, do go ahead and work here for a while, and make up your own mind. Of course, always make sure you can leave if it doesn't work for you. I don't work there anymore, but I gave myself a year before composing this, so that I could be objective, and avoid looking vindictive.
With that, let me begin ...

#1 - Legacy code -- you must have... heard this term thrown about casually, or in the titles of books you might have passed by -- but you will be working with legacy code that could be 10 or 20 years old. Now thats not a bad thing in itself, except that a whole lot of it was written by incompetent people (more of this in #2). I see you're not sufficiently scared yet -- I have three words for you -- ""GUI in Fortran"" -- if that doesn't do it for you, go ahead and send in your resume, you'll love the place.

#2 - Incompetent people -- they're all over the place -- it could be your colleagues, your managers, sales people you interface with. Part of this, I think, has to do with the broken recruitment process - I won't necessarily blame HR, rather the seemingly ad-hoc nature of the actual interview process itself (e.g. asking textbookish ""what is a singleton?"" instead of ""Solve problem XYZ"" self-selects the kinds of people that are unwilling to learn new stuff -- add them to a bunch of old-timers who know a lot of old stuff, and you have a potent mix).
Around the time I left, company policy removed the criteria of having a computer science degree for being hired as a developer -- read into this what you will.
I felt this people factor made everyone excessively paranoid, since, unable to rely on reason for how things should work, they were often reduced to superstition (""don't touch that code -- copy-paste it instead and put it on a flag instead!"" -- rinse and repeat, and you have spaghetti code the likes of which you cannot imagine -- unless, of course, eventually, inevitably -- you have to fix it)

#3 - Opaque work environment -- I never had a clue why we were doing what we were doing, or why we stopped doing it and began doing something else. Mysterious communiques were occasionally delivered once a year, and then ignored in the actual work ordered throughout the year.

#4 - Poor software principles - I was gonna lump this in with #1 or #2 but it deserves special mention since it encompasses and encourages both of them. Expect to waste days, weeks (months ?) doing monotonous work, only because people are unwilling, unable (or both) to do things differently. The excessively proprietary nature of *all* software means that not only are you forced to rely on substandard code, but also have to do without tools that are commonplace elsewhere (""What's that fancy svn/git thing ? We use RCS!"" (Seriously))

#5 - Weird billing process - at the end of each day, you're required to 'bill' time to a 'ticket'. Ok, nothing wrong with that. When I joined, I had no work for about two months -- I still had to bill time -- what's more, I saw that a couple of older employees in my team, actually *did nothing* and billed time to tickets they 'owned' for a long long time. This was quite bizarre at first, but after sufficient time, I internalized it and became a certified slacker myself.

#6 - Top down review process (actually, top down everything) - Your manager has the first, last and only say in what your performance was. Period. (The rest -- employees sucking up to their manager, going behind their colleagues' backs to talk to managers, stabbing said backs etc. -- follows from this)

[Caveat here: I didn't really see #3, #4 and #6 as terrible things until I moved to a different place where I had transparency, good tools and some kind of peer review, and was able to draw some contrast. I'm told that most banks are similar, and so in that respect, Bloomberg is certainly ""no worse"" than many places]


Finally, I must confess to a soft spot for the place, it being my first employer, and in any large organization, no narrative can successfully capture the small details. My manager was ok with time off and sick days, and not (unlike some reviews suggest) scary, intimidating and excessively micro-managing -- but yes, I did observe (both first-hand and second-hand) other managers doing the same, and I will happily admit that I fared better than most."
"278","Backstabbing, Managers behave like dictators with no accountability throughout the chain of command, outright lies on performance reviews,performance is proportional to psychophancy, culture of meritocracy and fairness being systematically dismantled, basically a H-1B sweatshop, blame the person you don't like instead of the real culprit and get him/her fired."
"279","Poor codebase and development tools creates a maintenance nightmare, you can find yourself spending more time firefighting and working around inefficient old code than creating new apps. Culture changed a few years ago to a 'metric' based system where you get rewarded more for ticking boxes and saying 'yes' to the right people further up the management chain (don't believe anyone who says the company has a flat... structure - there are 8 levels above mine and this is typical). Coupled with their philosophy of mainly promoting eager to please, inexperienced graduates this has led to whole layers of incompetent mangement led by similar, more senior managers who have no industry or engineering experience other than at Bloomberg. The only way of improving your prospects is by enrolling in a 'leadership' course led by the very same people, few people are promoted based on ability. There is no distinction between project managers and those with the necessary people skills to manage groups. Pension is not particularly good. Used to be able to work from home occasionally but now this must be approved by senior managers, just one example of the atmosphere of mistrust which had led to a general atmosphere of low morale."
"280","too much work...thery make you work like donkeys....if u are in a team like global trading u're life will be hell"
"281","There is very little opportunity for career advancement.   Whatever it is that you are hired to do, that is what you will always do."
"282","Annual reviews are frustrating since managers are told to downgrade people even if they are performing well, more experienced employees are not respected and tend to get replaced by very young and cheaper workforce"
"283","Lots of the codebase is pretty antiquated - Fortran code, old 1000 line C functions from the 1980s etc. 
Lots of proprietary stuff you have to learn that isn't transferrable, so you run the risk of getting a bit institutionalised.  Also, Bloomberg often unnecssarily has it's own little version of something (file I/O libraries etc).
Senior management have their head in the clouds & are fairly political - many have... been since the dawn of time and have an outdated view of how the company works, and they will push through initiatives that they have 'sold' to their superiors even if they just don't make sense at ground level.
One of those companies (and there are many) that sell themselves to applicants as having a 'flat' structure, when what this actually means is that hardly anyone ever gets moved up.
There is also lots of bureaucracy and a culture of micro-management - every working hour must be ticketed, accounted for etc."
"284","no partition/cubical in the office, hard to advance in title/pay/professional skill after working for a couple of yrs"
"285","Sometimes career paths can be unclear depending on what department you work in."
"286","Alpha-males thrive, the socially awkward are suppressed. NY-centric and lack of understanding/awareness of other locations. Upper management rule with an iron grip yet frequently prove to be the blockage. Timetables are often dictated to allow flexibility for the privileged few, at the expense of the many."
"287","1) No career advancement whatsoever. You may be stuck in your department for years and as long as you do the same repetitive tedious job and you hit the ""metrics"" they will like to keep you there.
2) Management is horrible. I can't believe I knew more about my job than my managers. They spend the whole day ""working"" on projects and micromanaging each and every one of your steps.
3) There is no loyalty to any... employee. They downsized a department recently and fired people that has been working with the company for 19 years without trying to accommodate them somehow (This happened in the London office).
4) Out of the blue, your department may just take into a new full set of responsibilities without having the preparation, training and most important, the HUMAN resources to do a good job. More work and more hours but the same pay and don't even dream of a future adjustment.  
5) Salary is very low, you will be working here for years and you barely will beat the inflation with the rises you get (2 % if you do get something). You take it our leave it, no negotiation, no seniority consideration, nothing. They know you will get frustrated and leave and they will get somebody for less money and will start the doom cycle all over again.
6) You spend more than 2 years in this company and you career is utterly and completely DONE. Bloomberg is not a financial software standard as they tell you it is, once you go into the financial industry (yes, the real one, not the one they make you believe you are working for) you realize you wasted your time. Is good if you learn to operate the software while working here, but at most it will take you a year to maximize your exposure. After that, please leave and never look back..... this leads to point:
6) If you are getting out of college, and you want to have some exposure to a financial ""Brand"" you can work here for no more than 1 1/2, 2 years. Get all the knowledge that you can assimilate, drink as much sugar loaded sodas as you can and leave fast! you don't want to get caught in their losers culture nor they ""Approach"" to bussines."

"337","- Management favors certain subordinates over others due to personality traits, not ability to perform the job.
- Management focuses too much on time estimates & performance metric measurements, and too little focus on providing proper guidance to subordinates. Subordinates are often left in the dark on how to approach tasks correctly.
- Management often ignores subordinate accomplishments, and instead focuses on... their mistakes, using them as a verbal & written weapon in yearly reviews, resulting in managers looking good to their managers, while the subordinate is demoralized. Management is also poor on properly suggesting how to help a subordinate fix or resolve mistakes.
- Too much focus on code ""appearance"" policies, and not enough focus on testing the code people write. It is almost as if management wants programmers to release mistakes to customers so they can blame the programmer when something goes wrong.
- R&D Training at the time I was an employee was almost 3 months long, with much of the material not even relevant to the job itself you get once you're done with training. There is clearly some miscommunication between the Training Instructors and the Programmers.
- Skilled programmers are often ""promoted away"" from programming into management, even if they are not good at managing people.
- Business is too focused on short-term quarterly earnings and refuse to let programming teams invest time on projects that could improve the company over the long term.
- Programming teams within company are too isolated from each other with almost no inter-team communication and very little lateral movement between teams. Every team appears to be ""trying to do everything themselves"".
- Depending on which group you're in, you could be stuck with ""mundane code maintenance"" instead of the more interesting job of coding new or enhanced features in the company products.
- Too many proprietory technologies. If you work here for too long, then leave to work elsewhere, you often end up ""relearning"" equivalent technologies.
- Even if you get a good yearly review, your raise is typically lower than the increase in overall cost of living in the New York City area.
- One nice manager I had was ""banned from the floor"" of a different programming group for catching bugs in their product & bringing it to their attention. People shouldn't be punished for doing the right thing.
- Typical workspace environment is full of hundreds of people (with no walls or cubicles) and can get very noisy. 10 people chatting is no big deal, but 100 people chatting is distracting when you're trying to code & rushing to make a deadline. Be prepared to be most productive in the late hours, after most people gone home, or at the very least wear some headphones with music playing to tune them out.
- Managers and business groups peer-pressure employees during company parties to ""get in"" on their mentality and whatever activity they're up to. If you disagree with what they're doing due to ethical or religious reasons, or you ""don't get"" what they're up to, you are immediately made fun of and ostracized."

"345","Although Bloomberg is a business that is solely owned by Michael Bloomberg, after Bloomberg left to become mayor of New York and entrusting the business to his partners and senior level executives, the management ran the company much like a publicly owned company which made it lose much of its charisma, luster, and appeal.  Prior to that, Bloomberg was very, well...""Bloomberg centric"", with a lot of internal... propaganda boasting the sheer genius of the CEO and president, complete with posters and books all over the office, much like what you would see in a stereo typical documentary of a communist country.  I personally didn't mind this so much, because the alternative was even more annoying.  Michael Bloomberg propaganda was replaced with sales propaganda and the entire office was forced to become very sales-centric, which for many departments outside of sales didn't make too much sense.


It is said that a career in Bloomberg is a ""Bloomberg Career"".  To clarify, what this means is that regardless of your previous experience, goals, skill set, etc, after you are hired, you can be moved into any department within Bloomberg at any time.  For example, you could be hired as a sales manager, but after a year, management may move you into Tech Support or into the Call Center as a call center operator, regardless of whether you can or want to do the job.   Although this is an extreme example of what could happen, it has happened before.  Hence, in many cases management does not care too much about your career nor take in consideration that this may not be a good move for you, but rather is focused on what they think is right.


Bonuses are fair (most of the time) but is highly dependent on sales performance.  The bonuses are paid  in the form of certificates or more commonly known as ""certs"".  Certs are given to you at the time of employment, and can fluctuate in value over the course of the year depending on the company's sales performance.  The good thing about this system is that you'll get a good idea how much your bonus will be. But the bad part is that unless you're a sales manager with the ability to make senior level decisions on sales initiatives, there is no way you can increase or control  the value of your certs.  All you can do is work hard and hope that your manager rewards you with more certs at your annual performance review, which will be paid the following year.

Base pay rarely changes (at least for me it didn't).  And based on talks with my colleagues, that seems to be consistent everywhere.  However, employees were rewarded (sometimes generously) with certs.  Some senior employees could have several hundred certs valued at anywhere from $300 to $1000+ per cert, depending on the sales performance for that year.  Furthermore, there seemed to be no apparent caps on the number of certs an employee is allowed to have.  So if you consistently get additional certs every year, your bonus can be considerably more than your base salary.  The biggest disadvantage is that even if you're not sales person, the bulk of your salary relies solely on performance of another individual or department.  Moreover, there are no guarantees that you'll be able to keep your certs.  A ""new"" manager who's trying to make budgetary cuts, can easily take them all away, which leaves very little incentive to work harder, or even stay with the company at all."
"346","1. Big companies can be unwieldy, but management has handled it well enough with weekly e-mails and town halls. I can't suggest a better alternative for now.
2. Pressure to meet bonuses can be stressful, but that's just part of the job and it motivates you to exceed it."
"347","Each job rotation is too quick. Often management have little idea of how the actual market is like."
"348","1) Career paths are almost non-existent, but senior management has been taking many steps over the last few months to fix this.  Needs to be seen how this plays out over the next few months.
2) Work experience depends on the team you are in.  Some of the teams are really great, but some of them are pretty bad too.
3) Politics.  The internal politics can be really bad (again, some teams are better than others).
4)... By and large, software practices range from poor to mediocre.  There are a few teams that are an exception to this (the infrastructure teams are really great, but product teams tend to be far more ""hack a fix, then worry about negative consequences later"". The infrastructure team, OTOH, use top notch software engineering practices).
5) The company is a weird mix of transparent, yet opaque.  There is a huge effort to appear transparent, but where most important decisions, even at the lowermost levels, are concerned, the decision making process is very opaque."

Absolutely no opportunities for growth. Management does not really care about growth of their employees - they just provide lip service with all the latest initiatives as they have to tackle the alarming attrition rate. 

Senior management is very old school and... does not know how to run a 21st century knowledge shop. It is a very 1980's mafia style work culture. Loyalty and appearance of loyalty is prized above everything else. New York Times called it a 'digital white-collar sweatshop'.

There is no thought given to software processes - it is a single minded focus to get stuff out to clients as fast as possible without regards to quality. As a result the product is a hotchpotch mix of applications which no one understands how to use. In their rush to get products out they have made some really bad software decisions which they have then spent man-decades correcting."
"352","Decreasing value year-over-year to my career. Developer management cares only about themselves and not their employees (saw this in several groups).

There are no cafeterias or places where you can eat lunch, strategically devised so you... will have to eat at your desks. If you are someone who needs rigid structure and micromanagement, this is the place for you!

"412","very rigid environment, although highly depends on the department, group, team and and supervisor/team lead. there is nowhere to advance, since system is highly customized it will take some years to learn and then may advance to team lead, to become manager takes longer and mostly those positions are taken by the people who have been with the company the longest. There is rarely team spirit even though one is... promoted. Each person is on his own. Bloomberg long ago became a big corporation in spirit and it acts and feels like one."
"413","Once a customer focused start-up formed by Michael Bloomberg, the company Bloomberg now resembles a large government-run monopoly resting on the laurels of growing market share and margins vs.Thomson Reuters.  Launching Bloomberg NEXT will give it a few more years of market leadership.

Long term, an organization is only as good as the quality of employees it can retain.  A number of the above-mentioned issues are... present in large organizations to a certain degree, but the lack of market discipline exacerbates these problems in Bloomberg.  Plan 10B is one step in the right direction to elevate staff performance, but more is needed to shakeup corporate culture.  As a first step, going public and paying employees with Bloomberg stock will force Bloomberg's senior management to write off non performing business segments, reduce unproductive deadwood, and align employee incentives to company P&L.

As a second step, it can consider merging its Data, QA, and R&D departments into one unit operating in US, Europe and Asia.  Include an audit trail, centralized approval of any code changes/fixes, thorough testing in each region, and up-to-date documentation to ensure proper integration of functionality and support across time zones.

These two will address the underlying problems and make the Michael Bloomberg brand something professionals are still proud to represent.  Finally, if Bloomberg is serious about expanding non terminal revenues in businesses where entry barriers are much lower, this may well be the only way ahead.

The same is about your outstanding peers  good honest people who really know the stuff are either already left or looking to leave shortly, except for those few poor souls who cannot move for external reasons. Those praised by TLs are really working their tail off to get out to other department and will have no problems to eat you, if you are seems to be a potential competition. You will experience capitalism there at its best.

Maybe some of the high level skills of debugging and problem solving may be of value but working on proprietary relational databases, proprietary web services, proprietary UI and development tools not to mention out dated programming... languages will get you nowhere fast.  How a company of this size thinks that they can develop a relational database that is better than say ""Oracle"" with their millions of man hours invested in their product suite is simply foolish to put it lightly.  This is a company that is so stuck in the past with their Fortran code still in use and their flagship product the ""Bloomberg Panel"" that looks like it was developed in the 1980's with its amber block character email system is just so unbelievable that a company would be so stuck in the past.  Their client base is strictly based on the amount of data they provide and clearly not on their innovation of modern software .  This a company where you have to fall in line with the management with decades of tenure that will do anything to keep the status quo and their job.  By adding layer upon layer of nonsense they can keep building their kingdoms of drones and promoting themselves and their software keeps living in the distant past.  It is also a place where big brother is watching you 24 hours a day.  Every email that you write is read by security, every phone call that you make is recorded, their are cameras and microphones everywhere.  You cannot leave the building unless you check out and security watches your every move.  The big brother attitude is unnecessary and you have to wonder how it really helps their bottom line.

Again, this shouldn't be a con, but if you are young and naive, you might find this... also to be distasteful. 

The only really big con is the annual review process, which is a curve-fitted algorithm to award future compensation based on relative (within your peer group) performance.

Atmosphere on development floor is very quiet - you may find this a plus, I found that it doesn't give a strong sense of belonging to a team as most people are working independently.  This can also lead to disjointed projects.

They have an internal job board which they have recently promoted and made a big deal of but it does not help if the hiring managers are all on different agendas.  It is very difficult for an employee to come to the company and create a PATH... because most of the hiring managers are not looking to build and develop skills in employees. They instead want outside experience for intermediate type roles to better build products.  They want to take knowledge instead of invest skills back into their own people. What that leaves younger employees with is a career that includes jumps around to numerous entry-level type positions or a career in sales.  Those that recognize this are still left stuck as the skills they develop at Bloomberg don't necessarily translate to marketable skills in finance (learning how to input a DRQS is not marketable).

You will likely work with outdated things like Fortran, Cobol or even Bloomberg's proprietary RDMS.  They actually think little Bloomberg can outdo Oracle with their millions of man hours invested.  Management in software... development is completely clueless about everything computer science related.  This is a place where management worries about what time you come in and building little clicks to start problems where there are none.

The place is run like big brother, security is watching you everywhere and the DO READ every email message you send or receive on your private email accounts - use your cell phone only!

"577","It's become big and clunky and very slow to react - not as fast and agile  as it used to be. Management structure is very flat so progression is relative, mostly sideways. Promotions are not always based on merit, so you have very young, inexperienced lower/middle management who excel at their roles as ""Yes"" men/women."
"578","One of the unfriendliest, poorly managed places I've ever worked. Many middle and senior managers are poorly trained, with weak skills, even for the news business.

They are also not sensitive to political situation in China. Well, at least they tried to sound like they know what is going on.
4. In the States, bbg hours are 8-5. In HK, bbg hours are 8-6. That's 5 hours more a week-260 hrs more a year- easily 20 days more of work.

We are constantly told to take risks, collaborate, and be innovative, yet the second anyone goes out on a limb, they are reprimanded for not conforming to standards. Management systems are outdated and uninspiring. Almost everyone I work with is miserable and either feel trapped due to needing job... stability or are counting down the days until they quit.

All software is developed in-house, for the most part you don't get to use industry standard tools. Bloomberg TV once had a vision to become the leader in financial news worldwide.  Just as the company was establishing itself to reach that goal, new management was brought in, the company footprint was reduced to...

-Lots of senior employees get transferred to an undesirable department (usually entry level like GTEC or GCUS) to get the senior employees to quit rather than fire them.
-Newer employees (3 years experience) often chosen for management roles over senior employees (7-15 years). It seems like once the new guys get more chances than the established veterans.

There seemed to be a lack of organization at the team lead and management levels which trickled down to the developers.... The open work environment basically meant constant interruptions. It was hard to focus and get anything done until the end of the day when most people had gone home.

On the other side of training is the unofficial requirement to spend time training new developers. Normally, when building a team this is a good thing, but in the 2 years I was there, I trained 5 temporary consultants. So, instead of building a team, all that training just went to completing their short term project, then they were gone."

I got negative performance reviews for mentoring others as the most senior developer on the... team.  Management did not understand the problem space at all - web development - and this made it very difficult to have non-stressful conversations with them.

"719","Improper distribution and lack of management concerning the same, hence a poor reach and bad reputation of the brand in the country.

"723","There are 2 potential downsides at Bloomberg that (if you are lucky and/or skilled enough) you should dearly avoid: inter company and interdepartmental politics and power-plays, and bureaucracy. 

There are a number of managers who earned and build their little power empires in the last 2 decades, and who are clinging on to both their power and their old ways. Avoid these trolls of the 90s at all costs! While... Bloomberg is very loyal to its employees, the downside is that these 'bad' managers and their little power tribes are not removed as they should be. THEY ARE PARASITES. If you are skilled and smart, you will learn how to avoid the bad manager vortex. 

The 2nd down is the occasional suffocating bureaucracy. Annual planning and budgeting is not unlike a 3 month ongoing water-boarding experience that has killed many a great business idea.

And the net installations of those Terminals determines almost 50% of your annual bonus. The company has dealt with numerous sexual harrassment allegations, and the stories of managers yelling at employees and even throwing phones at them are legendary. That culture continues at the company, with numerous managers incompetent at their job but who are excellent at bullying employees and treating everything as an immediate emergency. Finally, keeping with their 1980s mentality, they don't let you work from home, even when half the subway lines stop running because of a blizzard.

"761","Freelance means too much insecurity"
"762","The software environment is both challenging and very peculiar to the company, though.  And a lot of it is legacy, which means having to work within a set of constraints (binary compatibility with 1990s Fortran code, code relocatibility, proprietary routines) which I can pretty much guarantee you will not find anywhere else.  And because of those constraints, moving code thru to production is a major pain.  On some... particularly central class I was tasked to optimize, my changes took 6 months to percolate thru to production environment.

The bureaucracy is also sclerotic.  Having to document your working hours and bill it to various tickets (development, bug fixes, etc.) gets quickly tiring, and meaningless, as the fudge factor for accounting for 8 hrs day makes charging completely arbitrary.  Getting a TREQ (technical request for new projects) can be a pain.  All this is done thru the Bloomberg terminal which means there is nowhere to hide: your boss (but also pretty much anyone in the company) can find out about all the commands you typed during the day.  The terminal has quirks too and I can't count how many times I lost a long typed message because of a wrong key stroke.

But the reason I eventually left is that once you're in, the possibilities for raising your salary are limited.  You will do well to negotiate the highest you can on entry, it's unlikely to rise significantly after that.  Your first year bonus is invested/amanged by the company into internal stock (BB is private) and you only see it in your bank account after the end of the second year (with moderate interests).  The value of the internal stock can be tracked using another Bloomberg terminal function, so at least it's transparent.  That means of course when you leave they get to keep your current year bonus - the one they are still ""managing"" for you.  This is described by the employer as an incentive for you to invest in the company.  The longer you stay, the better.  Unfortunately, it makes leaving that much more painful.

Much of the work is tedious and menial, there's a fanatical dedication to proprietary tools and... methods (which as an experienced senior hire I really wasn't impressed by), no project management, poor planning.  It's a stifling, oppressive place that cripples all their best, most creative people.  R&D is a massive sweatshop that relies on an constant stream of incoming H1Bs and fresh college grads they can get to before they learn anything that might make them attractive to another company.

- Churn and burn. Every year they have to have a new crop of analysts coming in to replace the people that quit. In the past 6 months, half my team has left. Some even left having nothing else lined up.
- They simply do not want to accept that no one is going to pay 20K/yr for a terminal that looks like it is from 1980. Why should they when most of that data is free?
- Rather than berate their employees for violations such as not showing a positive attitude in the face of declining sales, they should instead spend that time checking out the competitors that are about to eat our lunch. Even the mainstream press has picked up on this.
 - It is a fact that many top banks no longer use the terminal. Not least because they discovered Bloomberg was spying on them thru the terminal. This information can be freely found doing any basic web search. That giant whooshing sound is the sound of customers leaving. But the management is asleep at the wheel and their response is to focus MORE on the terminal. Heard of the Emperor's New Clothes?

"805","Everything else. Does no one else find it odd that all of the reviews written by supposed software developers (the majority of which are non-native English speakers at BBG) tend to be written in perfect English, using American slang, and are all written using the same tone of voice? Does anyone else notice that if there are bad reviews posted, suddenly all the new good reviews, say the exact opposite of what the bad... reviews said word for word? Odd. I'm sure we will get a slate of reviews that attempt to sound non-native now, courtesy of HR.

Anyhow. Where to begin.

Stanley Young: He was hired to be the next chief executive of technology at BBG back in 2013. He quit in less than one year. Why would that be? Possibly because top execs at BBG refuse to believe that the terminal is going down and may not even be relevant in less than a decade? We've got machine learning now, people. We've got start ups that give away the very same product as BBG charges 20K per terminal a year for. We've got predicative analytics. And guess what. These start ups have a way better user interface, are easier to use, and more modern. The only reason people pay for BBG is for the IM feature. But guess what, there are competitors building better ones.

Incompetence abounds: I have had several incompetent leaders. Rather than replace them, or demote them, they are usually assigned a baby sitter who then makes sure they do their job correctly. Because no one at BBG can ever admit they made a mistake. Sometimes I feel the leads there would rather knowingly make a mistake than admit they are wrong. Odd for a company that has based its entire reputation on quality and preciseness of data to their customers.

The spying: not only did BBG get caught for spying on their customers, it is known that they track everything their employees do. I am sure they can write a report on how much time I spend in the bathroom, if they wanted to. Nobody is ever told what they do with these metrics, though. And you have no idea what you are being measured on, or by whom, or even why. It totally makes you paranoid. Who is watching me and why? It's like the NSA. They should read you your Miranda rights before working there because anything you say will be used against you.

Evaluation: Since everything about you is evaluated, you will look forward to your annual review where every tiny, petty little detail will be brought up and used as ammunition against giving you a raise. Were you late that one day? Look for it in your review! Did you dare question someone's incorrect opinion? You will see it right there in your review!

Workload: Team leads don't lead or work. They just spy on you and tattle to the boss. That's it.

Advancement: I have never seen any member of my team change roles, although they say you can after 18 months."

"835","Hard to reach superiors sometimes, communication could be poor sometimes.  Payment was slow arriving.  I worked part time and worked remotely, so my experiences might differ from others.  However just in the University Sales department (where I worked) I feel that they needed a bit more organization and also could use some additional managers.  I felt my manager was many times almost too busy to really devote full... attention to situations that would come up."
"836","The company is too focused on its terminal business and your year end bonus depends mostly on that divisions performance (it's a large part of the business).

Most procedures are made with the terminal business in mind and most of your work is performed using the terminal (even email)."
"837","Micro managers, full transparency of everything, treat you like you are 5 years old, ask for long work hours with not the best salary and horrible annual bonus/commission structure."
"838","The more people spent with the company the more they buy into the ""Bloomberg way"" of doing things even if it is against common sense and/or market practices. In particular, the technology foundations are fairly outdated and a lot of the time is spent fighting against the setbacks of existing systems as opposed to designing and delivering cutting edge solutions to clients."

"842","I would recommend this company for someone starting off out of college or for someone who is very senior looking to get a great pay package and looking to relax for their remaining work years.   For engineers who have been in the workforce for more than five years, it is a very bad proposition to stay at Bloomberg for too long.   The compensation increases eventually are very incremental and are below market... compared to other technology companies that offer equity.  Further, the lack of innovation and improving technology can slowly destroy your competitive advantage against your peers."
"843","lack of titles makes it hard to understand your career progression; open office structure can be loud and make it challenging to concentrate. little privacy at your desk. work-life balance programs could be better.  workload can be overwhelming and managers at times have unrealistic expectations for employees."

"845","Product managers and engineers will struggle to work across businesses and overcome twenty-five years of legacy systems; everything takes longer to get done or ships with less functionality than it should; many long-tenured employees are semi-retired at full pay, and loyalty is often put above current productivity"
"846","Managers don't know what they manage"
"847","Feel like another cog in the machine, worry about company's ability to innovate. Management in some departments is inexperienced."
"848","growth is difficult; there are a lot of employees and not many roads up"

"850","It's not a media company. Media is a minor side business. It doesn't always have the best interests of media division at heart.
They will work you hard. The 50-hour MINIMUM work week is often touted as a good thing, a competitive advantage. Expect to do 9-, 10-hour stints without the slightest break. This is the result of relentless cost-cutting over recent years.
Time off is adequate. Decent for an American... company.

"856","- Management culture is cult-like, holding loyalty, blood and sweat over real talent and wisdom
- Power struggles at the highest levels of the company (most importantly between the CEO and the head of product) tend to have a bigger role in business decisions than actual business
- At least a dozen ""lifers"", who would be utterly unemployable anywhere else, but are worshiped for blood spilled over projects past,... hang around in cushy on-the-job retirement positions, billing the company anywhere from $400K-$1.2M annually for jobs that are generally manufactured and pointless (""head of regional businesses"", ""chief PVF officer"")
- Core technology stack is so massive and yet painfully old that attempting to modernize it is an asymptotic goal. The great technical genius behind Bloomberg 2, what was supposed to be the future of the company (but will never actually ship), was a plan to move to the latest generation of Windows foundation libraries. Windows in 2012! Recruiting and PR will tell you that Bloomberg is using anything that sounds new and cool and all up in that web stuff. Somewhere, someone is doing that, yes. You won't. If you work in R&D, and if you want to succeed and earn the trust and respect of your peers, you will work on C, maybe some C++, and you will at least see Fortran if not change it. And it won't be good C code. It will be the kind of C code that reads ""int one = 2;"", written by unskilled recent college graduates that were mentored by managers with history majors.
- Uncle Mike's money spigot runs so fast and hard that managers on the product side are rarely held accountable for failures. With 85% of your revenue coming from a single, huge product sold on a flat price model, how do you measure success? The answer always ends up being some bogus metrics, which the good managers will figure out how to juke and/or just magically explain away while proposing next year's bigger, even more expensive plan, that will not only correct the mistakes of last year's plan but also introduce MORE, GLORIOUS MISTAKES.
- Severe violation of personal space, this culture has decided that your acceptance is conditional upon their complete and total ownership of your being. Even the most minute discrepancies in your schedule must be reported (publicly) and explained away; all work is logged and diced into spreadsheets put under constant scrutiny; all tickets (and there are zillions of them) go through piles and piles of approvals and re-routing; transparency is taken to an extreme that is disrespectful and psychologically abusive at times."
"857","Limited growth potential. Team Leaders & Mangers do very little to encourage individual growth. Far too great an emphasis on individual metrics, rather than long-term growth with company."
"858","Coming as an outsider it takes a while to adjust to the very collegiate and child like company culture.  They boast a flat structure,  but in reality it's quite hierarchical as everywhere."
"859","Zero career opportunities if you have experience.
Employees are treated like disposable razor blades, which are easily replaced and widely available.
Ambition, hard work and results not rewarded by either promotion or pay.

Pay not tied to transparent performance, but to obscure criteria. 
Company wide under staffing,... over working, numbness and demotivation.
Mindset, vision and management vastly dominated by white, male, Americans and British.
Lack of career opportunities at more senior levels means you might do the same job for years, which is very negative for morale and negative for creating a portfolio of updated marketable skills. 
Dangerously overexposed to, and overdependent of, a single product that might become obsolete, the Bloomberg terminal, and to a single cyclical client type who has not grown since 2008, global financial market players. 
Difficult to create meaningful new revenue sources to complement the Bloomberg terminal. 
Company replaced the go-get-it culture its founder had by a back-to-the-wall micro-management bureaucracy from the senior managers Mike choose to run his company.

I found (and not all the time but alot) that people from the market also look down on you and you're seen as the... ""bloomberg guy"" which is great if you want to just be the bloomberg guy and talk only about bloomberg but if not, then not so great. Oh and when it comes to ratings they can really screw you as its all about whether they like you or not and not really about sales - they have to rate on a curve so if you dont know who in your team will get a shi&t rating, then its you..."

The platforms and practices are so eclectic to Bloomberg that if you try and take them anywhere else, you're not going to know what you're doing....

Things like career development, ideas like advancement simply don't exist there.  You will be dumped into a massive pool of coders and basically just bang away at a keyboard until one day, you die.  I weep for the torrents of inbound kids, fresh from school, looking to start a career and what they have in store for them.

Bloomberg, the world is bigger than you.  There are ways of doing things so foreign, so superior to yours that surely they appear to be some form of dark magic, and I understand your fear but if you push through it a little bit, you might be capable of amazing things.

Very mediocre middle management, with promotions based on connections and time spent at the company (not always, but very often).

"896","Be prepared to make this job your life."
"897","As Bloomberg's traditional business model of selling terminals shrinks, it's being forced to invest in enterprise services. Most of the employees don't have an enterprise services background and that's leading to some tension. Many of the mid-level managers shun innovation in exchange for an easy life. The fixed hours and protocols encourage a lot of wasteful micro-management."
"898","Some teams are decidedly better than others, ranging from a bunch of very competent folks that would do well almost anywhere, to other teams which seem to be what's left after years of the cream of the crop skimming off to other places.

"920","Be assured that you won't be doing anything advanced in terms of programming. They focus on pushing out the product ASAP. Now customers thinks, wow that's fast.
Then, when something breaks(because of poor design, no unit test, they hire people who doesn't know how to write proper OOP code etc. etc.) then we apply quick hacky fix. Then client thinks, wow, what a customer service!

This is basically why they're NOT... changing, there's no business reason to change. 

If you are a good programmer, you will find better paying company and better environment to learn. 

Now they are having trouble hiring people, they even changed the policy regarding hiring past employees. (It used to be if you quit, you can never come back.) Also, it used to be that you have to pass 80% grade in their training class upon hiring, otherwise you get fired. Now.. there's no such thing, because they can't afford to lose more people. The standard has definitely gone down.

I would definitely not recommend this company to my programmer friends. I know at least 5 people who are actively preparing for job interviews. These are the better programmers in R&D as well.
I also know many people are there just waiting for the green card, once they get, it, they say they'll get out of here ASAP.

I should not have chosen Bloomberg the first place, I regret it. 
Their HR response was the fastest among the companies I applied to, that was the only reason I chose it because it was the first offer I got. I rejected subsequent (at least better in terms of pay) offers from other companies all because I already accepted the offer from Bloomberg. 
Time you interviews right, don't make the same mistake!

I only stayed as long as I have because my green card is almost here. I will quit the day I get it. Too many better opportunities out there. There's more to life than trivial DRQS's."
"921","no longer a growth organization
lack of perspective around flexibility 
outdated user interface"
"922","Bad managers.  Systems are redundant so that you are required to input same information over and over into different places.  Management is focused on trivial things instead of important things like revenue, happy clients, etc. Management is incapable of managing different personalities and expects everybody to conform to their perceived Bloomberg mold.  They make sure to underpay and overwork employees."

"926","Lots of old legacy code to deal with and use of proprietary API.  No privacy and no cubicles at all. Everything is an open area like a trader.  Hard to concentrate when you hear and see everything.  Too much politics."
"927","A significant amount of time is spent on doing the same task over and over again.  It limits the time you can actually work on meaningful or challenging products and can become boring and mundane.  The majority of roles in the company are centered on data ENTRY rather than data ANALYSIS as they lead you to believe.  There are many brilliant people in this company with advanced degrees and designations such as MBAs... and CFAs, yet they still do the same mundane tasks as others just starting at the company....ENTERING data....a task that could be completed by someone with a high school diploma. Nonetheless, the pay does consistently increase as you stay with the firm and there is significant opportunity to advance to managerial roles within your first 4-7 years with the firm."
"928","Managers have no idea how to develop and coach their direct reports. The company is only now beginning to use 180-degree feedback in the evaluation process. Too many people have worked there for too long and know nothing other than Bloomberg, thus have few ways of learning, growing, seeing how high-performing organizations really work."

"932","less politic battles focus on product development.
Hire people who can coding not those who know talking more than coding."
"933","- Salaries are generally low and tailored to the type of people they hire ie, not very experienced. Staff turnover is quite high as most people leave after 2-3 year stints in the company.
- The business has essentially stalled since its acquisition by Bloomberg in late 2009 owing to a very difficult environment (oversupplied European carbon market, focus away from climate change issues, etc). Don't expect great pay... rises every year.
- BNEF is sometimes biased about low carbon energy and keeps talking up the market - not always justified in my view. A lot of ""predictions"" for carbon price that we made over the years have proven wildly wrong."
"934","Potential for moving within offices is low"
"935","Some Cons that I faced:
- Sometimes it can become difficult to convince students majoring in areas other than business to take the BAT.
- There is a minimum of candidates required to have a session, which in some small campuses can become quite challenging to reach."
"936","When the benefits and colleagues are the high point of your day, something is wrong with the work.
With the exception of a few groups, chances are you will be working on an ancient software stack where the focus is to do a paint job and ship features as soon as possible. Not only is R&D management aware of this, the senior most managers actively evangelize paint jobs and to leave the rotting guts alone. This goes... against every engineer's basic instincts. Industry standard software practices such as unit testing, high availability, integration testing, quality control are verbally supported but not practically espoused in the over-arching Time-To-Market company motto. 
As an engineer, if you make peace with the fact that this is not a software company or a tech company by a long shot, you will be happy. Unfortunately, that also means that your skills deteriorate over time and with my shift to a startup I had to face an exceedingly steep learning curve. 
With all the myth propagated by management that compensation is top-notch, it is not. It is above average but not in the league of software companies offering equity. I left to join a small startup and got pretty much what I was making and some(equity). 
Hmmm management .... need I say more? All the reviews talk of terrible management and it is true. As an engineer you will not be treated as a professional, but as an untrustworthy resource that needs to be constantly monitored. This is reflected in their recent inability to hire engineers to fill open positions."
"937","Many in the management hierarchy have never worked elsewhere in tech; this leads to a bit of one-dimensional outlook on how things should be done, how employees should be treated and how they should behave.  Also, there is a tendency to under-react to accomplishments and over-react to mistakes."
"938","You are generally expected to do whatever the company needs at the time, which makes for depressing career prospects if you don't love sales and the prospect of moving around (including to regional offices). 

Though the company as a whole has a good vibe, there are some areas that are absolutely terrible. London ADSK was easily the worst experience of my working career. Even though you're not expected to stay in... that kind of help desk role forever, when your only out is basically sales (another department that leaves a lot to be desired) you don't have much choice but to take advantage of the unlimited snacks, strict 8-6 hours and switch off after work and look for another job."
"939","Long hours, for a account manager to work 8-6 plus travel, this is rather demanding. There is also very little to no growth despite how they will change titles of employees every 6 months. Just look around, all the senior folks have been there 20+ years and are going no where. The chances of one getting a decent position to move from Account Management to somewhere else are non-existent."
"940","Your experience can vary a great deal depending on the skills and leadership of your manager. Their is high turnover in the Sales and Analytics program and generally morale is low. It is easy to feel replaceable covering a sell side bank and your input does little to impact client decisions."
"941","Good for starting your career but not much upward potential."
"942","The company expects a strong work ethic from their employees, and the workload can be heavy at times."
"943","La filosofia è molto nello stile di Wall Street, in che significa lunghe e intense ore lavorative e la supposizione che non si smetta davvero mai di lavorare (beh solo UN PO' quando si è in vacanza). C'è anche un'eccessiva attenzione in termini di agenzia di informazione su quello che i clienti principali (per esempio le banche) vogliono leggere piuttosto che un più ampio spettro di notizie. Quindi a volte la... priorità sembra piuttosto assurda."

"948","Chasing fast but sometimes could be cheap solutions, which may cause bigger problems later. Maybe different teams are different, but at least in my team, rarely see people put efforts on code refactoring. I personally feel that the open floor could be very distractive to me, earmuff would be your good friend."

"970","Micro management, treating people like they are in pre school!"
"971","Not for career ambitions, too relaxed environment"
"972","Technology within the terminal was hard to use. Not enough time spent for training there."
"973","Certainly not a place to have a career. Flat organizational structure has its pros and cons. Culture can be very petty. They promote ""lifers"" to managerial positions, some of whom are seriously not employable elsewhere. Great place to work right out of college, but not after 30. Pay is not very competitive, but they will pay more to someone else to do the same job when hiring from outside. Once you're in the company..., you virtually have no place for negotiating salary unless you have an offer from somewhere else. Once you resign, you need to vacate the premises immediately after HR interview which appears to be about checking boxes and more employee surveys."
"974","Upward mobility at the firm is limited, especially if you are not in the New York or London offices. Compensation is also limited, employees do not work on commission."

The office you work at and the manager you work under will determines the work and office culture so expect inconsistencies in company culture. Open office culture does not necessarily mean better collaborative work culture nor better communication between colleagues. Some... offices can foster hostile working conditions and do not expect much from the HR to help you resolve anything. Company demands lifetime loyalty - as in if you leave them once you can never come back - something to think about because the company will still fire people as mercilessly as any other company would as and when the upper management feels necessary."
"982","Maybe this is the case for all high-caliber jobs, but be prepared to make it your life. The rigidness of the writing code can be very tiresome and boring - you won't necessarily want to share your work with your friends. The number of people that have to check off on your work - and color it with their opinions - is enormous, so be prepared to be frustrated as you await permission to launch. The place, though global..., is still very much run by a few people out of one office.

- Was promised certain materials, but it took a really long to get them and I still haven't got all of... them
- Takes a while to get paid and the method of doing so was confusing. Took about 2 months to receive my first pay

Core terminal sales is just really a sales job and Bloomberg's all about how many terminals you've sold, esp at some core terminal sales team.

"1005","Seems like that many employees in the London office are under 30 the younger the better, the prettier the better and its not all about your work.. it is certainly how you look.  Some of the women wear quite inappropriate dress, yes it's media and publishing but it's not a club
We call Bloomberg, BB and therefore Big Brother, you are monitored in and out of the building, the security guards ensure you swipe the card... as this shows up on the Bloomberg terminal (the OS) as to whether you are on site or not, not really a grown up way to operate.  Your manager will always know your whereabouts.  Seems untrusting.
There are some lovely teams who are made up of some seriously talented and experienced people ie the philanthropy group, the event teams, sales teams and the art group because of the nice people involved but as with every firm there are teams that are not so pleasant.
Given it's privately run status, the approach to marketing and sales seems to be very traditional and really run out of the US... with little understanding of how different Europe can be and the needs of sales.
There is something very bizarre about the culture here... read Bloomberg on Bloomberg and decide if you want to go there.

"1018","Bloomberg owns your life. Accept this. There is not a minute in the day that is not theirs. Although you are working for a news division, it is really a corporation -- expect it to behave like one. The closeness that comes with most news operations doesn't exist. It's a very political atmosphere with a lot of change in the management ranks. They hire a top editor at a national magazine and he or she is the greatest... thing that walked in the door.  A year later they are incompetent and moved over for the latest and greatest. News editors are ladder climbers and will not have your back. Don't expect that from them. If you can accept this, Bloomberg is a great place to work with wonderful opportunities and you should jump at it.

Career path is always pretty foggy.  If you're not into management, it can be very tough to really make... your mark. Management itself can be made more difficult than it needs to be.

 nearly impossible to take a vacation day
 terrible upper management
 the job itself is just absolutely terrible
 treated like the garbage dump of problems within the company
 you have to dress up for literally no reason
 force you to work weekends and holidays with little incentives
 very hard to move onto another job role in the company

1. Impossible to take a... vacation day:
The department only allows 4 people to have scheduled time off on a given day. This means you need to schedule time off way too far in advance (like over a month) for a single day off.  I had to take random Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays off throughout the year just to use my vacation days

2. Terrible upper management:
Your boss's boss has favorites and those are the people who get promoted to other positions.  In addition to that, I honestly can't remember a single meaningful conversation I had with him in. The 2.5 years I was there.

3. The job is terrible
I will summarize your job here: You sit at your desk for 8 hours taking calls about broken keyboards, bad internet, and problems you can't fix because the Bloomberg application was written in the 80s and still behaves that way. You get little to no help from resources within the company regarding this problems.  In addition to all that, you also get chats from Bloomberg users regarding their problems. All of this happens simultaneously so you basically get no break.

4.Treated like the garbage dump:
Everyone's technical problems that no one can figure out goes to GTEC and there's no hope of solving them because 9 timed out of 10 it's for another department.  You can't send the ticket back to them because you'll get QAed poorly and it effects your performance review

5. You have to dress up for no reason
We don't see any outside clients EVER. We don't work in the main office where they do Bloomberg news, so I don't understand the reason to dress up.

6. Working weekends
You are forced to work weekends. You don't get overtime (which I believe is against the law).  They give you a free day off. The weekends are just as bad as the weekdays expect worse because you have to work 10-7

7. Very hard to move within the company
Because all you'll know how to do is fix the Bloomberg application its very hard to move to a different role in the company (and outside the company too). I looked for over 6 months and couldn't find anything. All the jobs that get posted seem to already have someone lined up to take it."
"1087","Flat structure so promotion is not necessary a great thing, in house training can be poor when provided by someone who just wants to hit their agreed personal target on the hope of getting a non existent pay increase."

Eventually you might find yourself in a situation where bloomberg is the only company that is willing to... pay you for your outdated/deteriorated skills. Welcome to the family.

Also, you have to enjoy watching the markets from the sidelines instead of participating. It is a data driven job, so it can be pretty boring... and not too analytical."

"1172","If you prefer a more traditional office environment, this place is not for you. The structure of the building is nice to look at however moving around from one location to the next, is terrible. It takes so much time to go to your next meeting because the elevators do not stop at all floors and you have to go to different banks to get the one you need, which stills means there are some stairs involved somehow. UFFF.... There's no privacy- not that you need it at your job however when you work in upper mgmt there's some confidentiality needed however not at this place. This is definitely big brother watching type company. the moment you enter the building and swipe your badge your steps are being monitored. That's due to your badge that must be around your neck to move through the halls. They can tell where you are in the building and when you're in the building by logging in and simply typing a persons name and they can find out where you're  working from, how you're answering emails. It provides a symbol Red x (out of the office) Blue Cell phone, at Computer symbol for at your desk or whether you're remotely. its not too bad however I wasn't used to people knowing everything, and not that I had anything to hide however it was more the thought of knowing that everyone in the company knows this info is a little creepy. They expect the best and the most out of everyone, which they should, however its counter productive because you're not giving the tools and/or resources to complete a task, however they still expect the outcome to be superb execution with resourcefulness (being cheap). To get anything that you need, you have to put a ""ticket"" for any and everything and based on their requests, which is many on a daily basis, it could be a week before you get what you need to do your job. That ticket thing drove me crazy. you can't just call up IT with a computer issue, you have to put in a ticket. If there's a printer issue, you have to put in a ticket. You have a phone issue, you have to put in a ticket. to book a conference room you have to put in a ticket, and beyond for that. Because there aren't any titles, there's no one above anyone else, however that's still a problem because to me this sets up a lot of competition between each other in a counter productive sort of way. Everyone wants to show and wear their, positions, intelligence and wherewithal on their sleeves- and shoulders. It's actually unbelievable and i actually thought I could get used to that, but sheesh, I left with a headache every evening.  Oh, and did I mention that to log onto your computer, its done by your finger print, user name and password, along with all of your important info about yourself, which made me a little apprehensive about sharing my background info, such as school, every job I've had, time frames- hr info everything. It's kind of crazy that I'm even sharing that little tidbit. God forbid, someone was to hack into their systems, they will have everyone's info along with your finger prints. And it is mandatory to provide your picture, and background information or in 3 months your computer shuts down and in order to log back on you need to call IT and also include your info.  It's a private company so do not expect much. Also, if there stock exchange is open, you will be working. Rain, sleet or snow. You are expected to work from home if you're in a area where the roads are blocked, transportation issues or inclement weather.  There's only 3 holidays a year. Thanksgiving day, Christmas  Day, and New Years Day. Maybe when I started I had missed a few of them however after a year of employment, i only remember 3. I was able to take my vacation however upon resigning I was paid for 2 weeks because I did not use them all (no complaint there). I know some companies are moving more into open-floor plans but this is really difficult because you are literally elbow to elbow with colleagues. You hear everyone's conversation whether you want to or not, you can't help but to hear. There's constant interruptions because instead of people sending an email or calling you, they look to see if you're at your desk and walk over and interrupt and will actually stand there, even if you say give me a minute. To have a confidential business call, is impossible! Also, the pay bi monthly (on the 15th, and last day of the month)  not every 2 weeks. (you can get used to that, I did but thought it should be mentioned before hearing from the HR person) Thank goodness I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck. Oh and did I mention there are microphones through out the floors and hallways? Ufff. The safest place is the 6th floor which is the biggest snack room, company lobby. you must go to the 6th floor before you can go to any other of floor. Don't get me wrong, this place is great for a first job, or on the finance side money wise however the rest, media, is just so so. remember there's no board members and public stock, its a private company so there's only an OWNER. I was wide eyed and amazed and thought I had landed a fantastic opportunity, and it was however after leaving I realized my expectations were way too high. i actually thought I had won the victory, by joining this company, but the cost of losing a year of experience on this job was not worth it. I've never written a review before however if I can just help one person give it a second thought before making Bloomberg a choice, I wanted to lay out all of the little things that will drive you crazy. Don't settle or negotiate what you want, because they will try to tell that they salaries are low but the bonus make up for it. NOT. There's always an excuse. I wish I had known just a bit of this before turning down another offer for this one. I know this company works for some people and thats great. This just means that this review isn't for you. Thanks for reading."
"1173","Less pay. Should have paid more for the amount of work"
"1174","management decisions are not the most technology oriented. you will see spagetti code written 30 years ago and learn to live with them."
"1175","Very administrative, workload often times overwhelming."
"1176","As the top guy of any chain makes ALL the decisions is impossible to feel empowered. They talk a about the Bloomberg Culture , harder , faster and smarter but they miss the exact point of what makes a leader ie true independence to make decisions . Managers and Senior Manager walk around preaching the Bloomberg Culture but in truth they have no say at all. They just follow , the company has no notion of leadership... because it simply does not trust people .Most decision are made at the top of the organisation , the rest of the structure just nods , this is the true culture. The pay is ranked accordingly , as no one makes decision you are just paid to nod . The guy who nods the most and follows orders is the one that gets promoted. As real decisions are not even the pay grade of Heads of Sales the actual financial opportunities are limited for any one that can actually do sales or management very well.

Its a shame but the above is summarised by the fact that:
a) No employee every returns to work at Bloomberg, surprising given 10000 plus
b) Managers literally go grey taking others orders but feel as though they have little value to other companies - so they stay to take the pay check"
"1177","A lot of work.

"1181","-The definition of micro management, you have to alert your manager via going on ""hold"" if you want to leave your desk. Yes this includes bathroom breaks, this time away from your desk is kept track of and bench marked against your peers. 

-You are a glorified call center agent. Your ""metrics"" are kept track of ie number of completed chats vs taken chats, time on the phone, quality of chat (majority of the time... the ""quality"" of your chat will depend on how much the person reviewing likes you). These metrics are bench marked against the other 400 people in your department. 

- Although there is a metric system in place, if you are liked by your manager regardless of your metrics you can move onto sales although this is a rare. 

- The financial training you are taught is not put to use as your only concern on the job is completing a chat in the quickest amount of time. Which is usually directing the client to a particular function on the terminal.

-There is a rotation of weekends and holidays you have to work. If you want want to request one of these days off you must get a ""switch"".

Sales and Analytics  is viciours, as you spend more time within the department you realize there are no exit opportunities internally. You are either taking chats in some shape or form or in sales which is kept behind a closed door as it is not much better than analytics (aka taking chats). All managers are required to take chats when times are busy so you'll never truly escape taking chats. 

- You work shifts (7-4) (8-5) (9-6) (10-7) note you do not get to chose which shift you are assigned. There are also occasions where you are not given a full hour for lunch 

- Sales and Analytics department uses fear tactics to motivate employees

The job (analytics desk) can be a bit boring and stressful - when I began reps started general trouble shooting (is the issue technology or financial) and passed along to appropriate groups.

To be fair, there are many departments and divisions in the company, and a great number of people are very happy with Bloomberg.  Citator, on the other hand, is the company's effort to create the equivalent of the ""Shepardize"" feature at Lexis Nexis, which is an admirable effort but for the fact that the two people making... the big decisions are among the most incompetent, unintelligent middle management wastes of space in the history of corporate America.

"1285","Micro management. Treated like a child (although I am a 33y old married woman!), no trust in employees. Salary poor. Long hours - 8-18:00, if you are 5min late you are in trouble."
"1286","No cons, liked everything about the company."
"1287","as with every review on this site, the culture encourages micromanagement and extreme politics runabout."
"1288","culture of promoting people who are recognized for being hard edged and process focused. results in a many ""company men"" being pushed up the ranks at the expense of very smart people who do not fit this mold"

Pay is very average
Some groups expect weekends during peak season
Lack of clear vision from upper management
Very Fast Pace"
"1290","Good management generally, but middle management and lower are not trained well enough or are promoted too quickly and cannot manage effectively. Creates silos and morale reduces."
"1291","sluggish to implement new technologies, strong resistance to the unknown"
"1292","management disconnected form day to day operations that they supervise.  Promotion is very subjective.  Despite what they say, originality is not rewarded."
"1293","Firm level:
Terrible ""stupid"" hiring policy (this is not confidential anymore, search on quora): the HR will throw out the resume without looking if the candidate was a former Bloomberg employee, or even worse, that this person had declined an offer from Bloomberg before. (How are you going to compete in such a competitive market for tech talent?)
Performance review is stack ranking based and the managers have the... full say. As a result, employees are discouraged to share knowledge, but fight politics internally to be close to the managers. Individual contributors are less likely to disagree with the managers/TLs' idea. Wrong person get promoted/demoted time to time, not because of performance, but as a result of political matter.

R&D level
Poor software practice in the R&D, where almost non-existence of the automated software testing (not even at the unit-test level). The company encourage employees to be innovative firm-wide, however in practice, engineers are discouraged (indirectly) to innovate due to fear of breaking things. I personally knew at least 2 engineers were fired due to the production bugs they created. From my knowledge, the most senior managers in R&D are technical with some of the good visions. However, many of the mid, mid-senior level managers, are not technical at all. These people are usually the decision makers and I saw many missteps in the decision making progress during my 5 years there. 
Lack of developer productivity tools. Most engineers are still on vim/emacs and at the time I left, there's not a fully integrated SDK available. Eclipse is used, as only an editor."
"1294","Life is too easy for young people, people tends to be in the same position forever, which might not be good for passionate young professionals"
"1295","Depends on the department but most of the work is tedious and repetitive."
"1296","salary could be higher but"
"1297","No showers, so cycling in the morning was somewhat less of an option."
"1298","Intense work hours, long work hours, smaller office than others so there are limitations to grow."
"1299","No training, no documentation for the tools, ridiculous micromanagement by low-level managers who have no idea how to manage, don't ever be a whistle-blower on bad behavior, or you will be put on the road to disciplinary action, constant backstabbing by coworkers.  Basically like working in a junior high school.  Mostly 20 year olds who don't know that the culture is completely toxic.  Ridiculous arbitrary metrics... that have no validity for measurement of performance."
"1300","People stick to their teams"
"1301","Take seriously the 360-degree feedback"
"1302","Not much skills are developed, unless you proactively learn by yourself. High turn over based, location."
"1303","not so bad, And I do not know how to say that, because I think is not so bad, at least right now, I did not find any problems here"
"1304","Strong competitors emerging, rigidity with pricing and commercials, tough doing business with biggest customers in current environment, slow sales process as a result, if hungry for sales it can be slow in the wrong markets"
"1305","Boring. Many groups are still using old technologies."
"1306","Relatively slow to adapt to new technologies"
"1307","Some roles have limited career movement. Some roles overemphasize metrics."
"1308","There weren't many downsides. It's intense but not overwhelming."
"1309","Similar to a lot of big companies, one may need to contact various teams and hurdles in order to collect documentation for a problem that may be trivial in a smaller scale company."
"1310","Paranoid control freak culture. Internecine internal politics. Crazy rules for how to write stories."
"1311","Successes are not acknowledged. No matter what you do, more is asked. The bonus is tied to terminal sales which is a shame if that's not the product you sell."
"1312","* Technology and opportunities get stale after a while - as they are mostly proprietary"
"1313","After a couple years I couldn't wait to leave. No transparency in compensation & after a stellar year was awarded a few thousand because the unrealistic department sales quota wasn't met. 
Way to much bureaucracy and a work culture that promotes mediocracy & inside political politics."

"1318","Cut the working hours."
"1319","None, very happy, nothing bad to report"
"1320","Technology lagging, career path is not always clear (even though the flexibility is beneficial sometimes)"
"1321","People are promoted when they're in the right place at the right time, not because of skill. New hires are hired as contractors in some departments and full-time is something you're told you can get if you work hard, but preference is given to those who people please and suck up to those above them. You're expected to spend your life in the office with no time for yourself, and you're watched constantly. It feels... like a cult."
"1322","The need for intense security makes getting the simple things accomplished frustratingly painful. . Bloomberg wants everyone to succeed and utilize your time to the fullest, but it seems to set all of their systems up to make it as non-intuitive as possible thereby making it twice as hard to get anything done."
"1323","If you don't like having your work visible via the Terminal or if you're not a morning person or if you are lazy, Bloomberg is a bad place to work. If you need an office with a door, Bloomberg is a bad place to work. Management at times can be a bit aggressive as they try to wring every ounce of productivity out of you."
"1324","Micro-managed, no freedom, targets can be unrealistic but if and when you do hit them but whatever means, rewards can be decent though not substantial.  If wanting to move into the market, it can be difficult to get out of the ""vendor"" title."
"1325","Horários muito restritos. Pequena possibilidade de expor ideias."
"1326","some groups tend to be over bureaucratic in their procedures. 
depending on some groups -- the project may be managed in a knee jerk manner
make sure you work in the right team!"
"1327","- Not a lot of commitment to employee development-- very difficult to move around once you are in
- Micromanagement rises to the level of treating adults like they are in kindegarten-- lots of silly rules (the thing about the time that you got in to work being stamped on your emails all day is true)
- Impersonal, supercorporate culture was a poor fit for me personally"
"1328","* long hours
* mandate working hours
* old technologies.
* If you holds H1B visa as SDE, DO NOT work here if you want to switch companies before you got green card. Bloomberg won't provide any employment verification letters as needed by green card process if you switched to another company."
"1329","Maybe the downside is the limited desks in the group and we have to face the floating desks sometime."

"1337","training is long- lots of studying and staying late"
"1338","some managers play favoritism, location, HR"
"1339","Tough work-life balance. On call months, you can get called middle of the night."
"1340","Place seems to have become dysfuntional and chaotic (especially in Washington) since mike bloomberg returned, partly due to disastrous decisions made in his absence, like the laughable politics TV show and general political coverage. Some very good people have been let go or have quit and morale is lousy."
"1341","Its IT department uses a lot of build-in-house technology. Its technology is not cutting edge. Some skills you learn here may not be very useful out of Bloomberg."
"1342","Company culture is very aggressive. Difficult to take holiday hence why the culture is seemingly aggressive - made to reach targets at any cost. The hours are ridiculously long with the contractual hours being 8am-6pm which was not explained during the recruitment process. 

The actually aesthetics of terminal is somewhat outdated and at times difficult to use which makes it difficult as you have no choice but use... it.   

FTC are not provided with benefits and all contingent workers are given limited access to some of the features of the terminal which makes you feel like an outsider."
"1343","There are not any cons that I can think of."
"1344","Long hours, but only sometimes."
"1345","Works can be hectic some times. It is demanding. and working environment are noisy because open floor, and emphasize on communications among engineers, business, analysts etc."
"1346","Bloomberg cultures might seem like idealized or abstract there will be cases when it does not feel like the cultures are there at all specially when doing routinary tasks. How much the company is amazing as it sounds depends on how much you get involved in it. You have to take extra time and effort if you really want to rip the benefits of working in a company that pretends to be so unique. Given the industry the... company operates on compensation could be better but then I have never heard anyone saying the salary they have is enough. Depending on your role it can feel that the way your performance is evaluated is a little too much archaic. As an outsider the company definitely looks and sounds much better than it actually is."
"1347","Gym allowance could be a little higher."
"1348","Unbelievable internal politics, poor opportunities for career advancement unless you fight & fight, long hours (8-6 standard), poor work/life balance, poor morale and happiness amongst staff. They are probably reaching the maximum of the number of terminals they can install."
"1349","Too many meetings. 

Some people don't know what they should work at."

"1352","lots of the same stuff.  meetings every day"
"1353","Micro-management even after you have been consistently performing well (it never stops)"
"1354","Really dependent on the team you land on. If your team has good accounts, you will have a happy life."
"1355","became too big and bureaucratic, market is saturated"
"1356","Structure is too flat. You grow to your limit in a few years, unless you move to HQ"
"1357","Daily beatings. Horrible place to work"
"1358","Hours can be long and sometimes not a personal organization because so big."
"1359","not too much growth"
"1360","Pointlessly long days given the work, mental drain of admin associated with terminal use and CRM (internal one) that is way behind modern versions, strange target culture - not quality but quantity focused."
"1361","Micromanagement by team leaders and sales managers.  Doesn't foster teamwork.  Not a lot of room for upward mobility even as regional managers and sales managers were demoted and shifted."

"1363","Very political and constant re-orgs."
"1364","hard working flow, the way calculate matrics sometimes does not make sense"
"1365","Reconsider working hours to be standardised across all regions. Promote managers with more scrutiny. Shift balance of power from New York to other regions"
"1366","staff were being laid off who were news anchors during a period of time. It was very worrisome."

"1368","Salaries are too low, too many ratings metrics which are not reflective of quality sales performance"

"1372","Too much focus on the short term."
"1373","No pressure. Pretty old technology. Some of the skills are not portable at all."
"1374","salary, dificult to gain new coleagues"
"1375","Too much work politics. Most Managers have been with the company from inception and have not yet caught up with the new and better way of managing. And no diversity especially from upper management."
"1376","Large company so changes to products sometimes do not come fast enough. Difficult to take on a project and see it through to completion as there are so many internal obstacles. Typical large corp red tape."
"1377","Management treats you like a number/statistic, all the talk is in numbers whether there are enough headcount, even lower levels of management."
"1378","They promote flexibility and internal job moves, but don't actually practice it well."
"1379","Lots of cliques, particularly in the older teams. Avoid the older teams."
"1380","Sometimes there's an over reliance on legacy technologies and a safety first strategy can sometimes hinder development cycles."
"1381","Long hours, work / life out of balance."
"1382","Salaries and Bonus could improve, little space for being relocated between offices."
"1383","poor career progress opportunities. This company is a slow moving large organization where change is extremely painful and difficult."
"1384","Outdated technology, many groups don't do any actual development. Outsourcing is rampant outside of core terminal business."
"1385","The tech stack is 10 years too old.
Lack of energy in management to try new things"
"1386","Empresa engessada muito dependente do que a matriz quer. Empresa composta por Gerentes e não líderes. Empresa vende uma coisa internamente mas nem sempre cumpre com o que diz. Para chegar a algum lugar, há de ser muito político. Nunca discorde de seu chefe."
"1387","Occasionally old school mentality, sometimes management wants to old ways of selling products."
"1388","Absolutely no point in expecting to have a life outside of this  organisation, if you want to have the ability to work from home flexibly then forget about it. Make sure you check the job description properly when applying and if in a specialist role, make sure it does not involve ADSK/SDSK. 

Was told on interview that it's a project based role, in actuality it's glorified customer support. 

Do not work here if... you have children, the hours and lack of flexibility would not lend itself to you. Anyone that does have children has had to take a pay cut or make some kind of sacrifice."
"1389","Lots of hoops to jump through due to company size, annoying tasks that are not relevant, outdated pricing model, work itself not super interesting."
"1390","Limited career growth opportunities
A lot of politics and favoritism in the team
Very hard to move around without any connection
A lot of metrics
Good for people who look to retire but not for people who wants to keep growing"
"1391","The system and procedures change more often than the documentation leaving many people with a lot of questions regarding how to proceed."
"1392","75% of the journalists and editors are mediocre and wouldn't be as well paid or senior anywhere else."
"1393","Management should strive to be clearer and more transparent about corporate priorities and direction, at every level. Weekly memos from the top aren't enough."
"1394","My team consisted of people quite a lot older than me, which made it hard to relate to them. They also didn't talk a lot, which can make it a bit depressing when you're sitting in front of a screen all day - it'd be nice to break up the monotony a bit.

The hours are also very long, and combined with an hour long tube journey each way there was really no free time available (aside from weekends), which just really... took it out of me."
"1395","Very long hours and expectations that employees stay after hours. Repetitive job in tasks that could one would expect had been automated."
"1396","Bloomberg is a private company, so you can't get stock options or other bonus. Also, bloomberg doesn't use the most fancy tech."
"1397","need to find ways to provide more market knowledge to their employees to know more about the clients and the external market rather than just be satisfied with knowing what works within the company"
"1398","Expected to do the same job as the employees for one 1/2 to 1/3 less pay, no benefits, expected to travel between 3 data centers and not get re-imbursed for travel. No paid time off, my father died and they would not even pay me for one day. Employees get a really nice bonus every year you don't even get a christmas card. You are a nobody until they need you to fill in for one of the employees. There is a negative... attitude towards the contractors here.  Everything you do you will be held accountable for while there is no accountability for employees. No pay increases.  Shortly after my second year anniversary i asked for a pay increase and they let me go. Said i was not a good fit for the company.  I would not recommend taking a job as a contractor in the Data Center unless you have absolutely no experience, even then it's a dead end."
"1399","Not much vision for career advancement other than the raise and compensation. Upper management is pretty much not moving at all. Can notice a lot of politics in the upper management. Very corporate. Very financy atmosphere -- feels uptight overall, so R&D makes an extra effort to make it chill. For the engineers who are actually interested in finance (which isn't the case for many people.. but for these special... kind), this is THE place to work at.. otherwise.. just not so much motivating or fun."
"1400","- Career Opportunities.  Now this depends on individuals' goals, but from coming from a small company in the financial industry, I've found that opportunities here are very limited.  After you've worked in the industry for some time, projects complete, and they turn into maintenance mode (aka ""keeping the lights on"") in the company.  This is very necessary evil since once functions complete, support needs to remain... for the function, but this lowers the amount of meaningful work that can be done.  Those that want to change things up will generally be pointed towards the direction of management.
- Challenges.  This expands on the above point.  Unfortunately, the amount of challenges in this company are very limited.  The problems can be difficult, but with the wrong reasons.  This includes challenges from compliance, poor design, and complex internal architecture.  There's significantly less ""fun"" challenges in the work compared to a startup or smaller shop.  This can lead to some days that feel terribly long due to working on mind-numbing tasks.  All companies will have these tasks, but Bloomberg seems to have a lot more do to their extensive use of proprietary tools.
- Legacy technologies.  Bloomberg is involved with ""modern"" technologies like Hadoop/HBase and Redis, but a very large portion of the foundation software is still C++98 (with a Bloomberg Standard Library to cover some of the C++11 features), but the technology lags behind significantly due to all the dependencies in the software."
"1401","Worst department dynamics I have ever experienced. Employees are treated like slaves."
"1402","There is nothing I need to write on con section"
"1403","Suggerirei alla compagnia di velocizzare il processo ma è la mia opinione, in ogni caso ho apprezzato l'ambiente e la visione"
"1404","Misleading job advert, data entry job dressed up as being an Analyst job - some teams are better than others but many people do copy paste.

Must spend minimum 18 months in data before can move internally to sales etc. Data is in smaller separate building so you have no interaction with people from the rest of the organisation although this will change when move to new office currently under construction.

Near... complete lack of exposure to intelligent people to learn from, as to be expected from data entry role... Smarter people with industry experience work in other teams in completely different building.

Strange infantile environment, like being back at school. You will be treated like a child. Cult-like. Micromanagement."
"1405","No lunches were provided. The internship program is obviously designed for software engineers"
"1406","Too big for its own good, can't get out of its own way, difficult to innovate on top of 18000 employees"
"1407","A little too young in that there is a lack of maturity and credibility in many leaders and sales people. A culture that is very focused on them and not clients. No privacy. Big brother type atmosphere that breeds paranoia."
"1408","- If you get placed in a team or are in a department with bad/incompetent/micro-managing/ nonsensical-metric-oriented managers then you will feel like another cog in the wheel and be very disheartened.

"1410","poor career progress opportunities. terrible management, very old technology,"
"1411","Long hours, sweatshop mentality. poor training"
"1412","Loud and distracting office setting, impossible deadlines, overwork, broken toolchain, broken everything, manual processes, time wasting hurdles, continual firedrills, only 2% of time writing code, zero collaboration between engineers, no work life balance, high stress environment, proprietary infrastructure, career deadend, no chance to use new technologies, soul numbing work, the bloomberg terminal is a joke."

"1423","too many in-house technologies
no stocks"
"1424","Everything is overly routinised and one becomes simply a number in terms of performance evaluation and role in the company. There is little room for creativity in writing and emphasis is placed on business / economic reporting rather than journalism. While the hours are good, one is expected to work with their nose to the grindstone during working hours. Everything is tracked in terms of the speed of breaking news,... number of pieces published and the number of ""clicks"" a story receives. One feels like they are reduced to a mere number in terms of performance. This is very different when compared to other new outfits."
"1425","You need to be self motivated. There is not a set structured path for advancement"
"1426","Hours are demanding as in many financial companies"
"1427","there are no cons aside from tedious work - suck it up"
"1428","It's very big brother and you feel that you are being watched. It varies from dept to dept and of course who you have for a manager. BBG is not a flexible working environment at all. The hours can be quite long. They have a strong no nepotism policy for externals but nothing for internals, its contradictory as a senior leader would move to a dept and take 20+ in senior mgt from her previous dept- if that's not... nepotism I am not  sure what is!"

Not a lot of hiring for the west coast office"

"1461","Lack of of inspired management. Trying to emulate other networks successes. No one is a producer at Bloomberg because they are at the peak of there career. Now hires young inexperienced all around 'Shooters/editors'"
"1462","The ambassador program has little structure which makes it difficult. The company never really checks in with its ambassadors ever."
"1463","Culture had changed.  In some of the units, the promotion was based on who you know.  Some managers were very difficult to work with, and all their care was to make their boss happy."
"1464","Hard work. Restrictive in terms of work flexibility and work from home options."

There have been so many changes recently that nobody knows what the priorities will be next next and so many are afraid their jobs may be in jeopardy at any time. Additionally, once hired, pay raises are tough to come by."
"1472","By virtue of being such a large company with thousands of developers, Bloomberg can't always offer interesting projects to everyone, so it takes a long time to make tangible impact on a product. 
Development is very slow because the developer tools are either nonexistent or impossible to use.

"1480","I received an oral offer as R & D software engineer a year before my graduation. Three months later, their recruiter gave me a phone call and reneged it, without caring or taking any responsibility of the other offers and interviews I have declined for them. 

I received an oral offer over the phone after interviewing them on campus around end of Sep, 2015. Since I still have a year left in school and only taking... two masters courses, I asked for a part-time intern opportunity to work in their Princeton office, mostly to get familiar with their teams and development environment. Before the intern started I told their manager about my availability constraints ( only available this semester & winter , and would take time off during exams ) and they told me it's fine and sent me an part-time intern offer letter to sign on. On the contract it says ""Expected work hours per week : 10 hrs"". Also, either the manager or part-time offer letter mentioned anything about its potential impact of my full-time offer.

Then I interned at a team throughout Nov.2015 - Jan.2016, worked mostly 4 days a week, averaging 25 ~ 30 hrs for the weeks I came to work. I took a whole week off during finals and another week during Christmas and New Year. 

The program itself is very disorganized : No intern / new hire training, no clarification of performance expectation, no assigned project, and no desk. Yes I never had a desk assigned to me throughout the entire internship. I was told to fix bugs in their current production code and I worked closely with my mentor on daily basis. I managed to fix all the bugs they assigned to me and my code went to production.

After telling them I wouldn't be able to work part-time after my last semester starts, as we agreed upon before I start interning, I received a phone call from Bloomberg's recruiter couple weeks later said they would renege on my full-time offer. ""Based on your review from your team, your technical ability has no problem, but it's the communication issue. Therefore we decided to not give you full-time offer"". Later that night I called my mentor and he told me he knew what I did, he was satisfied about my performance since I was able to pick up their project and fix bugs quickly. He insisted to keep me in the team, but their team lead who never assigned anything to me or worked with me claimed I am not dedicated to the company since I took days off during final. Recruiting team did not take any responsibility of the other offers and interviews I have declined, insisted the decision is final and there's nothing I can do about it.

I talked to my friends and professional engineers who had experience with Bloomberg. This company has a terrible record of reneging people' offer / fire new employees during their recruiting process. They basically don't care about how it would effect your career as a software engineer. You are a new grad who is not experienced with employment laws / process, and they would do whatever they need as long as they think it would benefit their company. Be very careful if you are considering Bloomberg as your full-time employer, they have reneged / fired people before they join, during their new hire training, even in your first six months.

After all this is a company which would say ""Technical ability is fine, but team lead doesn't like your communication "" to renege an incoming engineer's offer."

"1486","The reality is it's actually very hard to move internally at Bloomberg despite what they try to say as roles are highly specialized and this is a serious downfall for those not in the know. If you're a journalist or developer, that's not the case. But for those in product management or specific verticals, moving within the company can be punishing. Sometimes even the most qualified candidates don't get chosen for a... role based on a manager's whim. It's also very hard to move back to a role once you've left one so employees can get stuck, even when they are highly skilled and knowledgeable. You basically have to wait for someone to transfer or get fired and then hope a manager in power will take you back. One could wait years for a role to open, so it usually ends up with the employee voluntarily leaving. Thus making a career here is not for everyone. Certain departments function extremely well like core product whereas media and enterprise are faced with constant reorgs and management challenges. Work/balance non existent in certain departments. The company tries to act like it embraces promotion of women and minorities but in practice it's far from reality. They have tried to move positively in the direction of greater flexibility but it really varies depending on the department/role/manager. It's not uncommon for some employees to be expected to work 12 hours a day with the average being 10, making it not very family friendly. Especially at headquarters."
"1487","Opaque, annoying management with a bit of rank-and-yank Wall Street BS. Frequent management changes meant oral promises were never kept."
"1488","Too many lower to mid-level managers(bean counters) that will turn Bloomberg into a dinosaur."
"1489","Should you apply for a job because of the free food.  Absolutely not. I am massively surprised that that is the first thing that comes to mind when employees are reviewing their life at Bloomberg.  Work should be about what you are doing not what you are eating. 

Working in the ""Analytics"" department is very misleading.  In no way are you an analyst. In no way are you learning the skill set to become an analyst. ... You are not reviewing balance sheets, or capital structures, or debt distributions.  You are a minion, a cog in a wheel, a beast of burden, forever in fear of the dreaded QC.  You churn out MSN/AOL style chats wherein a client comes in and asks a question.  You don't know the answer, you pass on to someone more experienced.

Some may find it too overwhelming and in your face, especially you have worked elsewhere before, it might... take you some time to digest, accept, try to fit in. Often you will know within the first 6months to a year if you will stay or leave. The company values loyalty, there are many home grown talents, whose only job in their life is Bloomberg, however some of them might lack maturity and all they know is the Bloomberg way. The fact that the company is able to bring in people with external experience, it keeps the company competitive and challenges the status quo."

Too much control and too much micromanagement. Absolutely no work life as everyone is dead tired by the end of their shift (expect minimum 10 hours).

-Culture of fear. Managers live to intimidate their team members.
-Every single thing you do at Bloomberg must be recorded in their internal ticketing system. If your manager didn't like the way you record something, you will be threatened with termination. 
-Open seating floor plans are usually a good idea, however at Bloomberg this means you get 2 square feet of your own space before you bump into your neighbor. If one person on your floor is sick, everyone will be sick within 3 days. Absolutely no privacy.
-Culture of Brainwashing. People who have been at Bloomberg for over 2 years can not form a sentence in or out of work without saying ''Bloomberg'' at least once. 
-Bloomberg pretends that there is good career advancement, but in reality, all roles are glorified call center type roles. Pay increases for employees are less than inflation rates.

To top it all off, you're in central New Jersey with slim prospects... of moving to another Bloomberg office within 18 months, which leads to high attrition rates and low morale among young employees and a collective sense that this is a place where careers go to die, and should be used temporarily as a stepping stone while you study for the CFA. People jokingly call 'Global Data' 'Global Data Entry', and this name fits. 

Yes, data processing may be inherently tedious work, however that is greatly exacerbated when the department has collectively shrugged its shoulders at any legitimate efforts to utilize the widespread advances in technology and data processing automation of the last 15 years, instead relying on questionable and incredibly outdated tools and processes (literally, in many cases these ave not been updated at all since the 1990s). Management talks the talk of leveraging technology (OMG the crowd! codecademy!), but in most cases these solutions are far too little too late and are further hurt by a lack of any legitimate R&D support. Analysts with little to no technical background (who are further surrounded by older employees with no desire for change) can only do so much.

There is no room for growth, although they will tell you differently through all the different seminars and information sessions. You start in data, you will end in data, unless you actively look for something better outside the company. And the reason for that brings me to my final point...
The upper management of Global Data in Princeton, NJ is the most inept, unintelligent, smug, condescending, bureaucratic, and just downright incompetent bunch of individuals to run a department. Most of them have been there since the building was opened, which somehow legitimizes there sense of entitlement. They preach transparency and collaboration yet they offer no insight and no growth opportunities, unless that means making their jobs easier so they have more time to talk about little league in the kitchen.

So it's not just the stress of upset clients but also having your team leader eyes on... you because you are taking too long to get that resolve.

"1580","After the initial 8 week training period, you start as a generalist fielding questions from Bloomberg customers over an Instant Chat service. Essentially a glorified call centre role. After a stint of doing this from 1-2 years (some might be a bit quicker), you are assigned to a sales team where you put your knowledge of how the BBG terminal works to demonstrate the tools to clients. For the lucky few this may... involve a bit of travel, but in terms of actually what you are doing, it is just showing people how the bbg tools work face to face. I.e. show them how to pull up graphs, display their news properly. Once you get a bit more senior in the role you may start to show clients tools related to valuing swaps, options and how to chart using technical analysis. That said, there are always specialists who know more, so you never go into too much detail with clients. The main goal of you as a rep at this stage is to sell, and targets are clearly visible using internal systems to all employees and managers.

If you're not in the top half of the scoreboard you are harrassed about your performance. As one person on my team put it ""it was best to not be too good, as you will get noticed, but also not to be too bad, else you got noticed"" so the idea was to strategically not draw too much attention to yourself for fear of getting questioned on your performance.

Managers in this place are not actual 'managers' - in that they don't encourage, support nor get the most out of people. The company promotes from within, and so those who rise to managers are simply those who have stuck it out and have more 'familiarity' with the product. 

This is something the company needs to address, as having someone who is experienced and having someone who can manage others are clearly not one of the same thing. 

Managers (not just mine) have a reputation of micro-managing and creating a stressful environment for it's employees.

There is often a clique between managers and certain employees on the teams too (star performers) which excludes about 80% of the team so you do the math - this kind of culture will only serve to promote those at the top, when another way of looking at the same problem would be to raise the performance standard for everyone, and not to discriminate. This would be more socially and financially profitable to the team and culture.

Certainly, if you look at this maturely, cultivating a customer-oriented mindset will form a solid foundation for future business endeavours. Bloomberg is also deeply integrated into the Fintech space through Bloomberg Beta and mike's personal acquisitions, giving you a clean picture of how technology is integrated into the regulatory, operational, data and financial market frameworks.

Why not use that money to give higher bonuses and salaries? For NYC they're not that competitive IMHO. 
Another issue is opportunity and growth. The company is very hierarchical and people who are in management positions never move up. Therefore expect to be doing the same job for decades before seeing any promotion on the horizon. That's a big negative for most.

Very hard to find a job if you stay more than a year. Most of the people who work... for company for years because they cannot find another job, not because they love the job.

Job wise, learning curve is steep in the beginning, flattens out after 8-9 months. Very number driven, schedule is micro managed, you can't have ""idle time"" cos they're watching you out.. Service impact is limited since we're chasing... numbers. Business decision is made top down from HQ so we're just executing a strategy that doesn't really apply to most of our clients in Asia. Yet management wants everyone to be superhumans that hit both number and quality of service..

data... management only involves the specific tools used at bloomberg and so you dont develop any transferable skills outside bloomberg. This is what we do every day: set up Bloomberg´s data tools to automatically collect data on a regular basis. Again and again and again and again. Oh, and create tickers for this points. The most exciting thing you might do after a year or so doing this horrendous job, could be to become responsible for maintaining specific data or data management tasks or admin or vendors.

5) managers and team leaders have very little idea of how to do their job and if they do they are given very little space to do things differently
6) incredibly rigid 
7) if you're in global data ... I repeat - you're locked up in a misery of tasks - there is no need to have any sort of education to do what we do. 
8)if you're in analytics (the 2 years path to go onto sales)... well most people quit within 4 to 6 months of how bad it is.

My suggestion: ask very specific questions of what you would be doing during the interview to find out if you actually want this job. It will look bad if you quit before 2 years and if you stay then what valuable skills did you earn during your time at bbg? I think you will have a hard time trying not to feel embarrassed  if you were to tell the truth about what you did at bloomberg."

The rules and bureaucracy start to suffocate.

"1776","*This review only reflects ADSK (sales and analytics) I did not have much exposure to other Non-Core terminal departments. I would give 4 starts as a company but 1 star for the department.

I joined Bloomberg after my graduate degree thinking/hoping I will be an analyst. However after I worked for nearly two years I can tell you that it is not an ""analytics"" 

-Most of us were hired to move to sales quickly and... very focused on all interviews. BUT in reality, not many people move to sales as there is no demand. People usually wait 2 years or more to join and mean time stuck taking""tickets"" 

-Long hours of doing the same thing. As mentioned, there are not much to analyze on a daily basis. All you doing is just looking up for functions or fixing excel sheet. Everything is monitored and made us feel bad taking a break or going to a bathroom. Those ""Stats"" are everything as most of the ""team leaders"" luck with management skills so that your performance is depend on that stats. If you help others it will not be good for your stats so team work is not great. Especially people with no real skills tend to focus on stats as they wont be able to do much else to show.

-""Training"" they provide is NOT a financial education. It is only for use of the terminal. You become ""specialists"" but most of them does not know basic knowledge of finance. I.e. first week of training they will explain what is bond and stock...(yes they actually did) then after few weeks of training you become ""specialist"". 

-Your future depends on the team you are assigned to. In this department, it is all about being liked by the management and have a good stats. NOT knowing real finance at all. If you get stuck with not good team or manager it is very challenging to move anywhere. 

-No transferable skills. The job is all about the terminal. This is one of the biggest issue. You will get stuck with this department. I have seen so many ""analyst"" (without any financial background) trying to find a job after couple of years but cannot get any. Knowing how to use the terminal is a good skill but without actual financial knowledge no one will hire you. Then this is the part that gets worse. Those people without skills cannot move to sales or find a new job so they stick around and become Team Leader without any people or management skills. 

-Very fast turnover. People who can leave do leave very fast. others stuck with ADSK will left doing the same job over and over. TL will put a lot of pressure on you to keep up the stats even though people are leaving because of them. The reason is very simple, their pay is based on the stats as well and their stats is basically our stats. So they want big bonus so they will use you as much as possible to achieve what they want. 

I would NOT recommend anyone for this potion to be honest. Yes, Bloomberg is a good name but when you look for a new job name will not get you a job but your ability. So little you can learn from this department and unreasonable amount of unnecessary stress it is very poor work experience. If you are thinking about joining, you should think well. If you have to take it then leave fast. Your market value will decrease rapidly."

Few of the upper management has a tech background so that they do not know much about how to... improve the efficient of the developers by improving the overall software infrastructure. Most of the developers works hard and they are generally smart but the overall productivity is quite low. One example is that we do reinvent the wheel a lot. One example is that for almost every teams that use Python they write their own python util module. Let's say their are 100 teams that use python and there could be 100 different version of parseTimeInput method in their own git repo. I have no idea why the whole company do not maintain only one general python lib that all team can use.

"1821","- I believe the unusual combination of Bloomberg's private ownership and dominant market position have created a culture of nepotism, inefficiency and general poor management that persists across the firm but particularly in Analytics.

- The nature of running a 24/7 Helpdesk means you do not have control over basic aspects of your working life (what time you have lunch, leaving work early, taking time off)

-... The core terminal business is currently in decline and business is tough. This doesn't make for a happy salesforce or happy clients. Management have persisted with high sales targets that, when not hit, cause pay to stagnant and bonuses to be cut.

- What is not made clear at interview is that you now spend 2-3 years on the Helpdesk before moving to sales/other areas. Even when people are ready to move on their careers are held back.

- Too many people get enticed to work at Bloomberg on the snacks in the pantry and cool office design- don't! The novelty wears off after a month. Base your decision on more substantial factors.

----
Bloomberg Intelligence management is clueless, offensive, and could careless about morale. The second in command at the department was... inappropriate on many occasions. Absolutely terrible, unless you stroked his ego. Pay was terrible. Loads of mind games. Management lied about raises (e.g. ""you're getting a 5% raise"", but what really happened is they took the guaranteed bonus away and added half of it to your base, which actually decreased the total comp.). Some management asked straight up prohibited questions about medical histories, medications, etc.

One friend of mine (who also quit) was a foreigner and was more or less held hostage by Bloomberg's sponsoring of his/her employment visa. He/she was paid nearly 30,000 less than the associates that worked beneath him/her.

At one point, an email was sent around saying that we would have to work outside our normal 8-6 hours to get work done if we wanted to be considered ""satisfactory"". One higher up employee tried to fight against it, but was silenced.

Very very poor room for growth. As Bloomberg is news, research, sales, and software, the best shot at a higher paying position within the company is to transfer outside of your skill area. All the recruiters I spoke to said the same thing. Further, the BI product is getting taken into a very bad place.

Every potential employer I appealed to when trying to make my exit told me that Bloomberg was the reason I wasn't hired.

Expect to be criticized: your shoes, your pants, the type of shirt you wear, your hair style, and FORGET ABOUT IT if you're a woman. Management's treatment of women in the department was disgusting. When I was there, only 15% of the entire NY department were women. Management will decide they don't like you, and make up reasons for why your performance is poor to push you out.

My manager was a nearly 20 year veteran of the company, that had already previously been demoted. If you voice a concern, he would tell me why I'm wrong, rather than actually trying to listen. Voicing a concern or a workplace problem actually would subject you to discipline. Think thought police.

In the short time I worked at Bloomberg Intelligence, no fewer than 25 people quit in the New York office, and there were only 75 to begin with. Management told me this was ""normal"".

Management tried to control associates from hanging out together and from talking to one another. I was used to asking coworkers ""hey, how was your weekend"" on Monday mornings, but was told this was inappropriate. I actually got spoken to by senior management who told me that discussing our personal lives was prohibited. Meanwhile, managers sent around birth announcements weekly.

Me and several former coworkers would literally cry to one another about the abuse and plain lack of care or concern for us that took place.

If you like low self-esteem, getting paid half of what your worth, and working over time just to quality as ""satisfactory"", then by all means take this job.

I was plainly told that management doesn't care if you're happy at the job. It's not their problem."

Over quantification: the department has pushed for a quantifiable metric in every possible area, discounting any intangible skills you add.... Each employee is viewed as comparable across so many different roles within the dept, when in some cases the comparison is not valid. During review time management can cherry pick uncharming stats, that often do not explain the full credit of your work, to justify mediocre  raises.  

Micromanagement - middle managers overly scrutinize work, to show their effectiveness as ""leaders"". Every aspect of your day is assigned, down to the min, by your team leader, the ability to work on your own scheduled prohibited, feeling as if you're being baby sat."

Way too top heavy; need more worker bees."
"1856","Notorious for extreme micromanagement. Structure creates a situation where direct managers are God.

Famous for being a ""Meritocracy"", but what they actually mean is ""Monoculture"". They promote on the basis of your fit which supposedly includes performance, but more accurately, cultural fit.

Cultural fit largely means being liked by your manager. If you are the type of person who can drink the Koolaid, do as... your told without question, tow the party line, brown nose etc. You can be Moulded into a Bloombot and fit right in. However if you are an independent thinker, creative, risk-taking, and god forbid; a bit eccentric. You will probably struggle (not to say you can't succeed. It just makes it much much harder)."

There is a lot of training to help you with this, but... you might feel underappreciated or underutilized when dealing with some clients."
"1864","Management won't discipline abusive team leaders. Still sweeps sexual harassment under the rug. Female employees often pushed out after maternity leave.

"1875","You'll never fully appreciate all the cons of life in that bubble until you've left. There's the big brother atmosphere. The lack of effective (or capable) managers in the newsroom. Rampant favoritism. Silly metrics. Everyone vying for 15 minutes of (Bloomberg) fame. The Game of Thrones-style backstabbing among upper management that permeates the culture. The thankless -- and soulless -- writing (am I really paying... off J-school debt by bullet-pointing a press release in 5 minutes or less? Sighhhh.). The times you'll catch a coworker crying/going through a personal crisis/trying to converse/act like a normal human...but you don't say anything because that's The Bloomberg Way. Then there are the idiots and egomaniacs, oft one in the same. Sure tell sign youve encountered onethey act like theyre Gods gift to this fair earth and you find other people believe the hype  and one day, you sorta dabble in the hype before you have an epiphanyTHIS IS BLOOMBERG AND NO ONE HERE IS A BFD! (Except Mr. Rose, hes legit.) Cuz, if someones a BFD, they get scooped up and outta there realquick. Cmon, get back to your senses and watch those time-stamps, already. And dont mind the hangers-on hoarding all the soup, theyre just trying to make it to retirement (sadly, a lot of em dont lately). Oh, and dont hold your breath for a cheerio from the no-longer-new EIC who has an uncanny ability to avoid anyone in the newsroom but his most inner circle. 

To be sure, if you dont let Bloomberg destroy your outlook on life (and please dont, especially the person who says he/she is just a meatsicle!), working there can actually offer some highly entertaining people watching. Just make sure you avoid the quicksandif you havent unshackled yourself after 5 years, the likelihood you ever will diminishes greatly."

Management does not look after existing employees and shows this every year with minimum pay increases, instead using the money to pay ludicrous wages for people they pull in from the street who end up writing garbage.... 

Management has turned what could be a great research department into a hamster wheel.

"1934","a bit more transparency in career progression would be welcomed."
"1935","HR are not so efficient"
"1936","Let me start by saying that if you think that this is a research department you will be horribly mistaken. This department reports into news and is nothing more than a glorified department of news. You will be lucky to find any form of analysis that you could use to form an investment decision and if you did use it as investment advice for your clients I would be very worried. This isnt necessarily because of the... analysts its more to do with the direction and strategy from management. 

There are some very bright, intelligent and talented analysts and associates here and there also some very overpayed, lazy and unqualified senior analysts that have more or less won the lotto by getting paid the sums they do for putting out what they call research. These senior analysts and management are one of the reasons for poor morale in the department and why most people are looking to get out. In the majority of cases this is where washed out and incompetent senior analysts come to retire and die. 

The only worrying thing is why does management continue to spend the sums they do to hire such incompetent analysts that they believe are well known in the market place and will bring a reputable franchise with them when it always continues to prove otherwise. The downside to this for the rest of the employees is that when it comes to the end of the year, associates and company analysts end up with a 0-3% pay increase because management has wasted so much money elsewhere or only look after the select clique. 

The management structure also means that the people rating you and the people that you report to at the end of the year dont actually work with you and have no way of properly understanding the work you have done or carried out during the year. This usually results in a farce of an end of year review, as its based purely on hearsay. In fact one of the senior analysts (one of the better senior analysts) recently left because he had no control over some of the other analysts who were below him in the same industry and left due to the poor quality of research. 

There are three way you will join this department: 
Senior Analyst: This is where you are expected to have 15+ years of experience covering your specific industry and are expected to be a well know figure in that space. In reality these are people with a very unknown or poor track record and in some cases havent even covered that industry before. On the plus side if you can secure a senior analyst role its like winning the lottery in terms of the amount of compensation that management will throw your way.

Company Analyst: This is where you will have had a couple of years on the street covering your industry and you come in as an experienced hire. In most cases this is where the smart employees are, but unfortunately are constantly shot down by the senior analysts and management. 

Associate: This is where you will come in as a junior. DO NOT DO THIS!!! It will be damaging to your career. You will know nothing about financial modeling, you will probably work for a senior who has no idea what they are doing and you will never get a job on Wall Street with the Bloomberg Intelligence name on your CV. This will pigeon hole you for life.

This could be a great department but given the Senior Analyst clique and managements strategy it just isnt. It is a giant blackhole on Bloombergs finances with no ROI. If management scrutinized what was going on a bit more, there is a good chance the department would be shut down. Senior people in Bloomberg Intelligence are regularly lying and misleading the senior management in the company."
"1937","Micro-Management with most managers as this is a cultural norm.
... There's a policy for absolutely every situation. If not, there will be one.
Individual goals change, expectations are always a stretch to meet"
"1938","Long hours, poor work-life balance"
"1939","Management are inexperienced and unorganized."
"1940","Let's be clear: nobody wants to work in the Analytics department, not even the people who work there. Either they are trying to use it as a stepping stone for another department or for another company all together. Moving into sales is not as easy as they make it sound, unless you speak German or French; otherwise forget about it. The turnover in the department is very high with about 1 or 2 people quitting on a... weekly basis. They are being celebrated like they've escaped prison. 

The micro management is extremely high, many other reviews have gone into this in a lot of detail. 

The more senior management doesn't care what's going on as long as the numbers turn out in their favour and they can pat themselves on the back. That people get depressions working there is insignificant as long as the statistics in Europe are better than in the US. After a few months of working there, you learn how to manipulate the numbers in your favour and then management tweaks them even more. 

If you show that you want something too much, you won't get it. They might promise you to move into a different department and then revert on that position last minute. You're supposed to get a pay rise when you become an ""advanced specialist"" but that doesn't always happen and the reasons are arbitrary or don't exist. 

Most of the management is in this department for the money. With their skill set, they would only get half their salary in the outside world, so they opted to become ""Bloombots"". 

Whoever wrote that job description should get a price. Greatest piece of fiction I have read in a long time."
"1941","The company is ok, but data department is a dead end.. Most, if not all the TLs (Team leader, the lowest level of manager) are inexperienced and have 0 knowledge on how our client is actually using our data/functions. The department constantly brag and inflate the ""wins"" which make ppl feel good, but all the ""wins"" are either fake, or have no value. People, especially TLs, spend most of the time doing nothing but... micro managing. Don't expect any good leadership from TLs. The only type of ppl who got promoted to TLs are those who are good at corporate BS and can keep talking non-sense forever."

"1944","No cons as of now"
"1945","Annual salary inrease is predetermined by time served and it makes absolutely no difference if you are a slacker who contributed nothing or a star performer"
"1946","Quality vs Quantity? Management purely care about quantity and generating numbers in any kind of fraudulent way possible. Recently I've noticed a marked increase in this trend as they have ""clamped down"" on the senior or advance specialist teams. This means two things. Firstly, treating the more seasoned employees (the survivors) like children and bringing in inexperienced Team Leaders whose sole competence in life... is tracking KPIs and complaining when you won't help them cheat or fudge the numbers. The second point is you'll now spend more of your time pitching (cold calling and annoying Bloomberg clients) about new applications on the terminal, problem is they pick the most basic and pointless ones to make best use of your time here. I might add at this point the whole ""advanced specialist"" or senior analyst route is a shame with management pressuring new hires into these roles to grow this part of the department bringing people as a ""qualified"" senior in as short as six months after joining. Knowledge and experience however can't be generated in this period of time and consequently quality as been diluted, however quantity increases on paper so management are happy meeting their goals. Final note is turnover, our department is around 150-180 in London and at the moment we have on average one person resigning per week which is 29-35% turnover per year and extremely high. This is being dealt with at the moment by trying to hire more and more new hires (potentially you) to try and counter this. They are struggling to keep our headcount at these levels with more people than ever resigning, however surprisingly they are having difficulties  finding enough people to put through their meat grinder....maybe one day they will realize their issue"
"1947","long working hrs
i cant really think of any cons , it is allll good i love it"
"1948","The other side to my HONEST and COMPREHENSIVE opinion that you need to read! I separated it into 3 parts for your liking: 

Job Scope:
- it is not finance-related, yet the team leaders there have somehow brainwashed themselves (or are good at acting) that it is. It's not.
- people are right - you copy data from the news and paste it to the terminal. I was so sad that the this was the actual job and that people here... were right.
- think about it... Our clients analyze the data. If we were to analyze the data for them, we would be taking their jobs. What position does that leave us to do... Except copy and paste it and make sure that it's correct (by checking online or somewhere). Even the ""equity research roles"" can't give their opinions because it will be taking their clients jobs (sell side research analysts who use the terminal).
- there is also no data analytics involved - forget about using R or Python to visualize and analyze the data. Read the point above - What is there left to analyze?
- everything is a ""project"". Writing a manual on how the work flow to my daily work is a ""project"". The lack of... Intensity and analytical work makes everything a project.

Management:
- my team leader (TL) was a... pain. The  TL I had somehow lied to herself into believing that this job was awesome (FYI everyone on the floor hates this job but most don't leave due to the security and pay it offers - yes, moral is low and management knows this).
- they can't be trusted. It's funny how every TL sounds similar in their answers to their team. Make sure you ask questions - a lot of people would say they came from wealth management firms and that working in Bloomberg is better. Ask more --> most of them worked in the back end office of these companies. No wonder bloomberg is better - it's moreso the same job with better pay.
- they pride in having a university atmosphere. First hearing this I was happy and excited. If you think about it... It's not really. A bunch of adults acting like kids and the TLs being the frat that everyone needs to suck up to in order to become one of them in the future.
- sounds nice, doesn't it, to tell people that you make your career your own in Bloomberg? Think again. Management uses that as a reason and excuse to cover their own mistakes. ""Boss what should I do?"" -> ""Idk. This is your career to make here in Bloomberg"". Think about what a great excuse that is and how they could use it against anything... And they do!
- a personal rant - I told my TL I was leaving and didn't like this position and felt like I was lied to about the job scope. TL replied by saying ""you said you like finance in the interview? You said you managing data?"" Seriously?! if you think this is finance and managing data means copy and pasting numbers, then sorry i must be wrong about liking either! (Im in finance still btw lol).

Exit Opportunities: 
- this is the biggest point for me. I'd take hell if there were decent exit ops. There aren't. For those who think it only sucks in the first year - people who have stayed 5 years tell me it doesn't get better and you are stuck copy and pasting data. 
- look on LinkedIn and check the career paths of these people. No one stayed long if they eventually entered a somewhat prestigious finance or consulting role - all left within a year. The reasons to why were already listed.
- managers would say ""person x left to Mckinsey or Credit Suisse."" Ask again - they stayed for 6-8 months in my office before leaving, knowing they deserved better.
- my colleague made a good point (been there for several years and regrets not leaving earlier). Said ""people in the finance industry knows what we do... And they know that it isn't finance. We go to them to train them and sell our products and they go to our offices for training and meetings. They know very well that we just copy and paste data. It's sad."" So lying your job scope into the finance industry is not an option.
- the longer you stay, the worst it is. You will get pigeon holed as a data analyst. Forget trying to get a front end job. Many people left to prestigious financial firms - if you look closer, they are in the back end team. Also, if you want to do backend, I'm not against it - but at least do engineering work and not copy and paste data...
- in my office, no one internally transferred to another team from the global data department because no one wanted to take us in... Sad.


Conclusion: if you're driven or want a career thats not boring, dont come here. I felt bad for one of my colleagues. This was the persons first job and i asked if the person liked the job. Said ""idk. Are all jobs like this? (in a sad and lost tone) i answered the person by saying ""no. You can do better"". And thats my advice to you all. If you worked hard for a good career, you deserve better than what they offer."

"1955","(Your experience will GREATLY differ depending on what team you join. The following only applies to my particular experience in a particular team.)

Company-wide:
* Too many people are being hired without the required skillset. E.g. many new developers with no previous C++ experience are trained on C++ for 2 weeks then start writing production code. You can imagine the results.
* Legacy technology, legacy... infrastructure. This varies from team to team, but in general every technology used here is quite hold and a PITA to work with. Want to use a library from GitHub? Good luck - Bloomberg has its own potentially-incompatible C++ Standard Library implementation. Want to use C++14? Nope, ancient compilers are used to support obsolete architectures.

Team specific:
* Most of the work is not engaging/interesting and revolves around implementation of business logic with no real algorithmic/performance challenge at all. 
* You are encourage to make the the code ""as simple as possible for new hires"". No - hire people who know the language that's being used well, instead.
* Working from home is a perk of the company, but I find it very hard to do it without feeling like my manager is upset about it. I wish this was encouraged and easier to schedule as long as people are doing their job. When I'm writing a component I don't need to be in the office - just let me do my work and come to the office when it's beneficial to everyone."
"1956","Legacy technology and lot's of processes."
"1957","Management adopts a Micro-manament style that it's unsustainable"
"1958","Again, I can only judge it in an engineer's points of views:
- Just so-so tech infrastructure among financial companies (not even counting some HFT firms). They use extremely out-of-date infrastructure that many had abandoned in early 2000. The key thing is: software engineering is NOT the money-maker; technical improvement is always secondary to ""keep things working as they are because clients need foobar before... next week"". In fact, even among financial companies, Bloomberg's tech infrastructure is no more than the average. You would be crying once you get into this company and learn what they're still trying to get on-board is something that mainstream has been using since 10 years ago. Seriously, take a look at whats popular 10 years ago and youll know how slow and frightening that Bloomberg moves ahead.
- However, compared to regular tech companies (not even to mention the big names), Bloomberg's tech stack is something that engineers may feel shame to talk about at their class re-unions. In fact, this is the most critical thing for young engineers who'd like to keep sharp in tech. To put it in the simplest way: Bloomberg (at its best eng teams) offers great opportunities to make single-cylinder combustion engines. Other tech companies provide engineers with some engines (proprietary and/or open-source) and they end up making rockets and space shuttles. At its regular teams in financial divisions, the tech stack is just... Its all about the business logic. NO TECH!
- No respect to former employees. Bloomberg never hires back former employees as loyalty is a key. So if you left, HR is not likely to take you serious anymore because they know youre not coming back. This happened to many of my colleagues who left the company. They got poor or even no support from the company for tax, health, immigration and legal needs. Some of them got into troubles because of that. Just sad.
- Blame-based performance evaluation system (they'll tell you it's merit-based but nope). Not too many chances/incentives to outperform.
- Work/life balance at some teams can be disastrous.
- Any fault is recorded. Low tolerance to faults, especially in divisions that make money. 
- Pays much less than the top tech companies."
"1959","Very bureaucratic and initiatives are often led by the US team, so if you are based in an EMEA team this can be a bit frustrating.  Long hours (at least 8am - 5pm)."

"1961","-overworked employees
-local management could be a lot better
-communication could be better also"
"1962","Micro management, short sighted view and preference for quick sale instead of long term relationship with customers. Decisions made out of NY and little consideration for other offices. Major decisions hastily made by a few elite management in the firm. Long working hour and many calls to attend after hours."
"1963","None no cons no cons no more no cons no cons no complaints no problem no complaints no cons no complaints from anyone no issues at all during my work week until I have decided to leave for achievements of higher goals. My company can bring in the Nations top talent and a very good competitive price to make your division more profitable and more productive"
"1964","Long hours and high expectations"
"1965","There is little regard for work-life balance.  The hours are 8am - 6pm in the London office, which is longer than either of the other two regions (APAC and Americas), and you will be expected to far exceed this.  Whilst a lot of managers are happy to allow a degree of flexibility, there are a lot of managers who are very anal about time keeping.  Badges mark when everyone is in and out of the office and makes it... feel much more like a ""big brother"" society than the open culture they claim they are trying to cultivate.  Prepare to live to work rather than work to live.

The biggest flaw at the company is cronyism.  There are a number of people who have got into middle management positions, with no relevant experience or credentials, other than being the hiring manager's friend.  You can easily tell who they are, they don't actually do any work and delegate everything to their more capable team members, whilst ensuring that they take all the credit of course.  They end up being far more a hindrance than an asset to the company.   Whilst networking is an important and natural part of any job, the extent to which it counts at Bloomberg needs to be looked at.  It isn't a widely spread problem, but it is a problem.

The upside is that senior managers who are not directly in the same reporting path easily spot this happening and are adept at cutting said managers out of the loop so the work can actually get done."

While Bloomberg LP does compensate its employees very generously, it can be ruthless about restructuring. I've seen high-performing employees being terminated for reasons that were far from clear.

"1977","Loyalty at Bloomberg, in my opinion, is equated with tenure rather than merit. Organic growth is encouraged but perhaps to a fault where tenured managers are cycled in to positions where they lack the ability to succeed and can, as a by product seriously damage morale.

Subjective Reviews
Favoritism
No accountability
I've seen employees with unethical practices be promoted
Hard focus on performance matrix that is not relevant at all, and becomes more difficult as top performers set higher benchmarks and expectations for others, essentially the bar is perpetually set higher, until you are worked to death,pushing... people out that once were considered the best at what they do.
Poor salaries
 Healthcare plan was good, but not anymore
HR works for the company to ensure that there are no lawsuits, and will threaten you if you open your mouth and force you to confront your manager, who between warnings can easily devise a plan to make your life a living hell, within the parameters of course.

Your closest colleagues will be chosen at random to become a team leader, the weak minded ones will immediately start drinking the cool aid. TL candidates beware."

-No transferable skills or knowledge that can help you seek other opportunities in finance. This is not a finance company, but a FinTech company.  It does not help you in Fintech either because you don't learn about business dev or technology. 

-No... options for promotions or a path for advancement. Moving horizontally to a sales role is the only option to get away from the grind of help desk. Don't be fooled by the roles of specialist, advance specialist thinking these are career advancement. It's just made to keep the oiled machine running. And people get stuck there with no where to go. These roles have no careers horizon or transferable skills outside of Bloomberg.

-When you leave, you have no marketable skills. You will have to start from the bottom in whichever industry you choose, including working as a financial analyst...

The wise ones figure this sham out very quickly and either leave as soon as they can or take an MBA class or CFA certification course, so they can be more ""marketable"" and in the meantime have money to pay the bills. Those who take a little longer to figure this sham, end up going to grad school to start over from the bottom and pick a different career unrelated to finance. I figured out this sham about a month after I was done with the training and was working as a generalist. I left after 8 months and reading other reviews here that confirm my observations, I'm happy I did not waste my time there."

Some abilities are not transferable 
Micromanagement throughout the organisation"
"2000","No work life balance at all in Asia when you're in manager level."
"2001","- No growth for new hires or prospective junior level
- Working process is quite routine wise and boring

"2005","lack of transferable skills

US-centric strategies
less than competitive salaries"
"2006","I guess that a few stories to represent the level of this company are better than a list of the cons:
- Week 4 of training, we are taught how to answer the phone/make a phone call following a script. Been called off as I was laughing during this ""lesson"" (note I was coming from Commodities Sales at Citi) and was obliged to make mock calls with the ""teacher"" until I got it ""right"" (bloomberg style right). 
-... Comments/sexual allusions that would be unacceptable even at a Uni party made towards women colleagues (I am a man, I worked on trading floors, I saw most of those stuffs in many places, but here it was literally ""oh we have this opening, you want it? Then why don't you show me your tits?"" - disgusting). 
- Micromanagement part 1: after working straight 7 to 11 (meaning I didn't even leave my chair to get a cup of water or going to the toilette), I decide to take a 10 mins break to pee, drink, and smoke a cigarette. When back I see chats coming from 5 different ""managers"" asking me where I was and why I wasn't taking questions flowing in from clients. 
- Micromanagement part 2: I come in the office with nausea, I end up vomiting in the toilette after 30 mins on the desk, disappearing for a good 20 mins. When back, I see I received the usual amounts of chats from people asking me why I wasn't working, I ignore them and go to the ""supervisor manager"" asking to leave as I just got sick. He asked me EXACTLY what I had and to give him more details. Well, I gave him all the details he wanted. 
- Snitching part 1: after months doing a particular process in the same way, I got called by manager who is livid and shouting at me as I didn't follow the correct process for that task. The next day I find out there were many people that knew about what I was doing (it was my 1st month there) and didn't say anything but were instead complaining about what I was doing... because of course in any normal company you spot an error and you don't help out, right? Absurd. 
- Snitching part 2: the infamous story of a guy who started with me, 35yo with wife and kids. He left his previous job as a store manager to start at Bloomberg, after 6 months he was fired. The funny thing being, his manager put him under ""performance plan"" after 5 months, which means you have 1 month to get better or you are out. He did become better. His manager calls him to get a meeting with HR on friday afternoon, telling him not to get worried, as everything will be fine and he passed his performance plan. What happened that friday? Fired. 
- Many stories, really many, of very stupid, not smart at all people getting promoted just because they were brown noses. Literally, as long as you say yes to managers ans swallow all their sheeets you'll have a great life, but then how can you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning? 
- Once we had a ""meeting"" to discuss a new product (a bloomberg function really, nothing more), we were asked to call clients (traders, equity) first thing in the morning at 8am. I suggested that maybe, just maybe, is not a great idea to call traders around market opening as 1. They won't listen to you, 2. They will shout at you, 3. If you keep doing that, they will finally hate Bloomberg, 4. Is simply a very stupid idea. Guess what? I've been called off by the manager and the guy doing this ridiculous presentation. 

I would love to call out names, those people really deserve the public shame. I'll limit to this, but please, if you really want a career in finance and you want to be recognized for your work, then don't work at Bloomberg. The job description they place online is one the best scam ever done on heart!"
"2007","Very siloed and protective management structure, not open to new ideas"
"2008","Flexibility is low, performance metrics could be improved"
"2009","- lack of clarity on product ownership"
"2010","FI Manager, FI Team Leader, Politics"
"2011","Ambiguity of roles 
Chaotic collaboration with team and other teams"
"2012","* Out-dated propriety technology - though things have definitely been changing in the last few years and there is a very visible drive to improve this
* The downside to the amazing salary is that you can't leave... so if you get stuck working with crappy technologies and you don't have the power to change it can be a tough situation to deal with.
* If you end up on the wrong team, you can get stuck writing crappy... javascript monoliths for 5 years without learning anything and you'll essentially be un-hireable, even by other teams within the company.
* The free food is mostly carbohydrate-based junk - crisps, bars, candy.
* Massive delays in deploying software and services due to firewall and proxy and machine change requests that take weeks/months to be applied.
* Open office environment can destroy productivity if you like to get in ""the zone""."
"2013","There are three roles you carry out in this department: answering clients' questions, calling clients with updates on the software, calling clients to discuss how their needs can be better covered with the Bloomberg terminal. The first role is what takes up most of your time and is what causes most stress, but the others only add to the generally accepted term of ""glorified call centre"", where we work 9+ hours a day... with only the breaks we allow ourselves, as the workload at no moment allows you time to breathe.
Your schedule is fixed to the minute and your work is broken down to micro-movements that are monitored with a great variety of statistical measurements, imposed by a management evermore worried to show that they are adding value in some way.
You do not rest and are not given time to carry out more value-adding activities during work hours, so do these after work, thus burning out after a few months. 
Your relationship with management can depend strongly on your performance in regards to your statistics, which do not reflect your efforts and passion to excel. And this can later have a negative impact on yearly salary increments."
"2014","I can not think any cons"
"2015","Perpetual silly KPIs enforced such as minimum call % /query,  pestering for user occupation surveys, micromanagement from supervisors if you are lacking in 'stats'. Some people liken it to a call centre, and I do feel it sometimes, though you do need to put some studying and thought into 

You'll be doing a lot of grunt work and repetitive question-answering; some department initiatives make you want to roll your... eyes.

Progression-wise, maybe if you want to do software account management/sales it's decent. Knowledge from studying on financial markets can't fully be applied/ learn things a bit on a superficial level. You might question why you are staying. 

Rather high turnover.

Regimental. Want to go on leave? Apply in advance, only available if there are slots for your asset class. Work from 8-6, every hour should be tagged with some form of productivity."
"2016","Proprietary technology cuts you off from the wider programming community"
"2017","Career growth can be somewhat limited outside of the core Terminal Sales group."
"2018","Favouritism 
It's about who you know and not how  hard you work

"2019","- Micromanagement

- Working to please business leaders rather than being effect marketing department
- Technology used if out of date
- Either you are in or you are out"
"2020","Bloomberg has changed. The culture was a community, and now it's cut-throat. Longer termed employees are being marginalized and pushed out. Teenagers are being put in charge of experienced employees. Bloomberg is out of runway. It's a job, not a career.  It's not the company it was."
"2021","Do not give enough feedback"
"2022","- There are a lot of office favorites. Some employees enjoy a lot more flexibility than others, regardless of performance.  Very inconsistent standards given on employee by employee basis 
- Office politics. Only suiting for a large company with a DC office
- No real career advancement. Once you take a job, you might have one more title that you can move to but thats about it. Mgmt positions don't open much and... when they do, they are given to favorites (not performance based). Several employees will leave BGov to move to a different part of BLP for advancement
- Very regimented. Management wants to push the idea of collaboration but it's only done to make you feel heard. No real execution from there or opportunity to learn from other departments on what makes a business go.
- Lack of drive. Large deals are to be had, but mgmt is more concerned about following the rules than getting more revenue. Lots of red tape 
- Top performers are rewarded with cut down territories, more red tape, and less flexibility."
"2023","It is clear decisions are made by one person.  But he has made all the right decisions, so it's not always a bad thing!"
"2024","If you join as an experienced hire it takes time to acclimate to the Bloomberg culture.  It takes time to develop work relationships."
"2025","- Harassment and bullying which is supported by and often carried out by middle management.
- Insufferable working environment. 
- Micromanagement and lack of rewards or positive feedback to internal employees. 
-Unskilled people 
-No salary raise even if you move departments for the first 8-10 months. 
-Very long hours including demands to work unpaid weekends and bank holidays.
-Micro-political games that... can actually affect your career there despite your real performance.
- Poor internal career progression programs. An application to move to another department cannot be made until 18 months within Bloomberg has been completed. 
-No recognition if you spend more hours at work or if your productivity is high.
- Over-advertised ''Bloomberg culture''"
"2026","Limited scope for career development, some teams are quite unstable with high turnover."
"2027","As it has grown, the ability to innovate and get things done quickly has become more difficult. It is still run largely from New York with most decisions and decision makers coming from there."
"2028","nothing. loved every single bit of it"
"2029","None! Great company with great people."
"2030","General CONS:

-From a long term business perspective Bloomberg has zero chance of growth; the market is saturated and begging for innovation, and customers usually do NOT like dealing or working with Bloomberg - most of the time they simply have no other option
-Employees are no longer valued assets, they are soldiers and rarely get recognition or praise from management.  You are expected to do your job, not... take risks, be quiet and make sure the ""Bloomberg cruise ship doesn't sink""
-The Bloomberg culture from the top down is hurting.  Not a company for people excited to grow a career, most employees who enjoy the salary and stability will fall in line and try to ""not get fired"".
-What you'll find here is the definition of people leaving or being unhappy because of the manager, not necessarily the company.  All of the pros listed above can prove worthless if you have a sub-par manager and within a negative environment.  
-The HR group within the company are robots and care little about employees below senior management.  There are DOZENS of stories about employees who have been wronged, treated unfairly and with disrespect - but HR's job is to make sure complaints are squashed and it doesn't make it up to Mike B.  Usually employee complaints are washed through the HR spin machine until the employee loses hope and either gives up, leaves or is shown the door.
-The working environment is very negative, but upper management is shielded from this or just doesn't want to know.  As of a month ago most employees either understand this and are accepting of it, or are extremely unhappy in their day to day.
-Bloomberg's first attempt at collaboration and enterprise technology has been a challenge, for both sales, product and engineering.  They don't get it.
-The sales organization overall does not understand enterprise sales, most managers would fail in a modern technology company.  
-It is a very flat company, there is no determined career path and most employees are all but convinced to be silent contributors.  You are all but told to not rock the boat.
-The culture is of extreme micro-management; all office entry/exit time-stamps are exposed internally, most managers expect you to take lunch less than 30 minutes and you usually have to be in at 8 and leave after 6.  
-Don't expect company sponsored events other than the summer picnic, most happy hours and events are looked down upon by managers.

CONS for Product Management and Engineering:

-Upper Management actually dissuades innovation, they think Bloomberg is fine the way it is, don't take risks
-If you care about customer (end user) experience, creative flexibility, and technology/tools developed after 2012 then Bloomberg is NOT for you.
-Most Product Managers are experts in the workflow of the user, not product or technology subject matter experts
-Engineering talent is respected and of high quality, but over the last few years the top talent are all being lost to more innovative tech companies:  Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Spotify, etc
- Several gaps and bugs pop up daily, and deploying or rolling out new features and functionality sometimes take weeks or months - not a great culture for innovative engineers - you'll want to go to one of the other big tech companies for that.  
-If you want to actually build interesting products, adapt to customer needs and create great user experiences, then look elsewhere
-There are more good product managers and engineers leaving rather than joining, a sign that the company and product is past it's prime 
-Bloomberg as a whole does not understand compliance technology, especially for non-Bloomberg data sets.  Customers are learning to look elsewhere.  

My overall message is to simply understand what you are getting yourself into by joining the company.  You'll make a good salary and meet some fun people, but if you care about advancing your career and being part of an innovative technology organization, then look elsewhere.  Some people are totally fine with the status quo and collecting paychecks.  But for those who care about careers and crave passion, if you look into their eyes you'll see souls dying.

If you have a personal commitment let your family and friends know they should be prepared for cancellations and being late.

Every job outside of engineering has... the customer service aspect. I didn't know data analyst meant customer service representative before I joined. 
If you have a degree, especially a technical degree, don't get fooled into coming because while they think they are a tech company, they are not. They dabble in automation and Python, but you still have the customer service part and data entry part.

My biggest frustration is that there is no long-term planning. Everyone just puts out the day-to-day fires. They enter the data and respond to customers requests, and a single request can shift your whole focus for that day. You do it all over again the next day.

"2149","Poor leadership. At the managerial level of the Analytics and Sales departments there is just a lack of strong leaders. Many are first time leaders and their metrics are determined by others that have little to no experience.

At the higher levels of leadership there is also a large gap in communication. Typically bigger picture items work their way down the rumor mill to Regional managers to Sales Managers to... Team Leaders then to the Reps who are meeting with clients. This is pretty funny for a company that prides itself on being a ""Flat organization."" Seldom do the big picture ideas come to fruition, and even more seldom do they solve the problems facing the larger client base without costing them more for the service.

Internal Metrics are god awful. They barely make any sense, and to try and communicate them to the outside world is impossible. For sales reps there is no commission structure and your bonus comes out of a black box so its impossible to know what your year end will look like. 

I know I put this as a Pro as well, but let me explain: They discuss how this is a ""sales team"" but it is more of a consulting role where you are assisting clients with their issues and utilizing the terminal as the solution.  This is great because you will learn some priceless lessons about running a business; however, when you sell them something you will not receive the credit. Some deals can be in the 6 digit range, but you will not see a penny of it. Also, there are a number of different departments that scrap for credit, and if you don't document your every call, your every interaction , or if your manager just doesn't fight for you - you will get 0 credit. At the end of the year ,the number of successes determine your pay so these  conversations matter even though there is no dollar figure associated with each one. Long story short - you can end up working a lot on a small deal and receive the same credit you would for working barely at all on a large one. Its all about the story you tell which is ridiculous."

Constantly bombarded with alerts, emails,... information, tv screens etc - you cannot switch this off and there are few quiet areas to retreat to. The open plan environment is very noisy, bustling and busy as this is part of the company's ""brand"".
The proprietary internal email and other Bloomberg internal systems that you must use are not flexible nor user-friendly.
Surprisingly harsh personal feedback i.e. request that I act more deferentially towards the hierarchy and express my opinion or give feedback less often even though company values include innovation, open to ideas, data-driven...
Managers are often smart people who are very good at the work they are required to produce (i.e. analysis, reports), but do not have particularly good people skills. That is, they promote people not because they will run a team well, but because they are very good at their current role. When I raised concerns with HR or senior staff about my manager - this was not addressed. I continued to struggle to communicate with my manager throughout my time at the company and felt actively disliked, but with little power to change my situation.
Self-promotion is key as opportunities to advance your career do not present themselves to you per se - you must seek them out.

-Too many sales reps with the same target (i.e terminal rep can get credit for data reps sales) resulted in inefficient client meetings. Clients no longer get even surprised when they see 4 reps (specialist, core, enterprise real time, enterprise general rep...) for an half an hour meeting.

It is crucial that you find contacts within global data that can give you an honest picture of the data team that you get the offer for.

One of the other things is that it is an unfortunate cycle where the talented folks quickly learn that they either got stiffed by a bad team/manager, or reached a professional/educational growth ceiling in their role.

"2335","The owner of Bloomberg L.P. famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! .sadly there is a con job going on within his business, right under his nose, within his Bloomberg Intelligence department (internally referred to as BI, externally by clients as BS) and he appears to be completely oblivious to it...

The Bloomberg Intelligence (BI)... mission, sadly, seems to be destroying the hard earned reputation of Bloomberg L.P.s owner and Analysts/Associates who work for the department through the combination of sheer management incompetence and deceitful practices.

How is BI Management accomplishing this mission? 

Bloomberg Intelligence writes BITs (Bloomberg Industry Thoughts) or commonly referred to internally by everyone in the department as SPAM. Each BIT is about 2 tweets long (~500 characters)these BITs are strung together to create the Wall Street's shallowest and most backward looking research product, the quality of which is multiples worst than Seeking Alpha and not even remotely comparable to traditional sell-side research.

Two primary products are produced: Primers (reworded investor presentations which are portrayed as insight) and Best Ideas (any old semi-coherent, half-baked, or ill-formed notion). An Analysts research quality is judged solely based on their initial compensation level (not the actual research they produce) and pay bands are extremely wide ($125K to $800K per year for nearly identical roles). BI Management refers to this pay scheme as a meritocracy, but it is literally the diametric opposite. This logic ensures that where you begin in terms of compensation within BI is where you end -- irrespective of the quality of research produced. This practice ensures mediocre research is the norm and persists because there is zero incentive to produce high quality work. 

The highest compensated Analysts in the department have Associates, recent college graduates who write BITs and work on their behalf.  Given that the quality of the 'research' does not matter, this setup enables the highest paid analysts to do very little, if any, analytical work and effectively arbitrage of the wide pay differentials between Analysts and Associates (who earn less than $125K per year). Bloomberg L.P. is paying some Analysts $600K+ while they  outsource the vast majority of the work to recent college graduates. BI Management refers to this practice as a ""perk"" of seniority, which decoded means that so long as you don't blow the whistle on them - they are happy to let some Analysts not earn their compensation. In fact, what BI Management is effectively doing is buying the silence of their most senior Analysts.

There is a quota for BITs that must be produced (20+ weekly), which primarily consist of Primers (20+ companies, 10 BITs minimum each, refreshed quarterly), Best Ideas (2 monthly, about 6 bits each), and other random pieces of information (the plug). This framework created by BI Management creates a never-ending treadmill of low value BITs/research that clients dont find useful. This is evidenced by the lack of traction and engagement with clients despite having the best distribution system on Wall Street - the Bloomberg Terminal. Analysts are routinely encouraged to put in fake PROs notes (the internal system to track client engagement) to hide this fact - a simple review of what merits a PROs note for BI would uncover this. Just compare a Sales PROs note to one produced by BI to see first hand the level of deception.

BIs key internal metric is hits (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through clickbait headlines and counting a BIT as a hit even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this client engagement -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly cant get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BIs management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan.this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for. 

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BIs profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting picked off by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Managements primary business strategy is putting lipstick on a pig. Given the extremely low quality of the product BIs management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned.and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme... 

It doesnt take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloombergs Board of Directors to eventually axe BIs entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false."

"2363","This is a review I found on glassdoor that i felt ENTIRELY represents the reality of BI, and so I felt it was more than appropriate to quote it here. I URGE you to read this in its entirety if you are thinking about joining BI:

""The owner of Bloomberg L.P. famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one! .sadly there is a con job going on... within his business, right under his nose, within his Bloomberg Intelligence department (internally referred to as BI, externally by clients as BS) and he appears to be completely oblivious to it...

The Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) mission, sadly, seems to be destroying the hard earned reputation of Bloomberg L.P.s owner and Analysts/Associates who work for the department through the combination of sheer management incompetence and deceitful practices.

How is BI Management accomplishing this mission?

Bloomberg Intelligence writes BITs (Bloomberg Industry Thoughts) or commonly referred to internally by everyone in the department as SPAM. Each BIT is about 2 tweets long (~500 characters)these BITs are strung together to create the Wall Street's shallowest and most backward looking research product, the quality of which is multiples worst than Seeking Alpha and not even remotely comparable to traditional sell-side research.

Two primary products are produced: Primers (reworded investor presentations which are portrayed as insight) and Best Ideas (any old semi-coherent, half-baked, or ill-formed notion). An Analysts research quality is judged solely based on their initial compensation level (not the actual research they produce) and pay bands are extremely wide ($125K to $800K per year for nearly identical roles). BI Management refers to this pay scheme as a meritocracy, but it is literally the diametric opposite. This logic ensures that where you begin in terms of compensation within BI is where you end -- irrespective of the quality of research produced. This practice ensures mediocre research is the norm and persists because there is zero incentive to produce high quality work.

The highest compensated Analysts in the department have Associates, recent college graduates who write BITs and work on their behalf. Given that the quality of the 'research' does not matter, this setup enables the highest paid analysts to do very little, if any, analytical work and effectively arbitrage of the wide pay differentials between Analysts and Associates (who earn less than $125K per year). Bloomberg L.P. is paying some Analysts $600K+ while they outsource the vast majority of the work to recent college graduates. BI Management refers to this practice as a ""perk"" of seniority, which decoded means that so long as you don't blow the whistle on them - they are happy to let some Analysts not earn their compensation. In fact, what BI Management is effectively doing is buying the silence of their most senior Analysts.

There is a quota for BITs that must be produced (20+ weekly), which primarily consist of Primers (20+ companies, 10 BITs minimum each, refreshed quarterly), Best Ideas (2 monthly, about 6 bits each), and other random pieces of information (the plug). This framework created by BI Management creates a never-ending treadmill of low value BITs/research that clients dont find useful. This is evidenced by the lack of traction and engagement with clients despite having the best distribution system on Wall Street - the Bloomberg Terminal. Analysts are routinely encouraged to put in fake PROs notes (the internal system to track client engagement) to hide this fact - a simple review of what merits a PROs note for BI would uncover this. Just compare a Sales PROs note to one produced by BI to see first hand the level of deception.

BIs key internal metric is hits (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through clickbait headlines and counting a BIT as a hit even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this client engagement -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly cant get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BIs management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan.this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for.

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BIs profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting picked off by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Managements primary business strategy is putting lipstick on a pig. Given the extremely low quality of the product BIs management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned.and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme...

It doesnt take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloombergs Board of Directors to eventually axe BIs entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false."""
"2364","Food is bad, could do with mire caviar and champagne"
"2365","Cons are mainly for the role itself.
-  Hiring is not role specific for fresh/recent graduates to the entry level analyst position. Under the same umbrella of the global data department, the nature of work can be quite different for different teams. However, this assignment  was not made known to the new hires until their first day or even later.
- Most of the daily work is based on the Bloomberg terminal and some... internal softwares and highly repetitive, which makes the knowledge of knowing a lot of nuances and judgement of knowing what data is wrong/correct not transferable to the next job
- The role should be best described as ""Data operations analyst"" or ""Data management analyst"" ( not ""Global Data Analyst"" or ""Market Analyst"" as that does not reflect the nature of the responsibilities).  As such, I do not see a long-term fit of any of the above 3 types of people if they are ambitious in further developing their  (emphasis: transferable) skills through work experience.
- A lot of so-called projects are exact duplicates, but people in different regions just keep on working on their localized ""projects"" even if it has already been done elsewhere.

However, there are people that have been there for years.  Other career prospects include being people's assistants, receptionists, entry-level HR, Analytics.  It is really about your TL and/or their manager co-signing that allows you to leave.  When you apply... for a position on the terminal (which is the way you go about leaving the department), there are behind-the scenes conversations that go on surrounding if you should be allowed to go and/or progress.  Not a lot of diversity.  Most, if not all, TLs are white women in GCUS and the rest of tech-ops is very male dominated. To become a TL, there is a very precise mold that you have to fill to really be considered. Experience is not a factor - it really is about ensuring that management will like you and that you completely obey without challenging whatsoever.    Again, there is now a hybrid outlook as many departments have been merged.  If you are looking for a fast-track way to advance, this position is not for you.  If you are looking for a job that will allow you to pay bills, save a bit, and is a 9-5 type feel-- not too bad.  You will also be over-worked and it is difficult getting time-off especially around holidays as it is a 24-hour system.  You must be liked by management to really progress and move up -- and to get them to like you -- you must kiss up to them.  It is not really about skill level as there are TLs who became TLs because they were liked and not because of ability.  The company as a whole has a 'boys club' type feel.  For people of color, especially black women, this company is behind and not really big on putting black people in leadership positions.  A few latinos are in leadership roles but rarely blacks and very little black women.  A few black women have left because they were consistently overlooked and overworked - although they were in good standing.  When it comes to pay and pay raises - it is a very arbitrary system.  A lot of secrecy surrounding that -- your colleague can be in the same role as you making more or less and there is no particular quantitative reason behind that.  I worked at the company for over 3 years.  Happy I did, paid into my 401k and happy that I left.  Also, you are not really skill-building in the role as you are basically on the phone all day.  Some people are nice.  Some aren't.  I have made good friends that I will carry for years.  A lot of people are looking to get ahead so you have to be really careful what you say and who you confide in.  I've taken a few months since I voluntarily resigned before writing this review as I wanted it to be as fair and honest as possible.  Best of luck in your job search!"

"2431","Now here are the cons:

First, take heed to many of the comments written about managers. Many managers currently in place have moved up the pipeline through connections or likability - not through grit or hard work. In addition,  your initial manager will define your success or failure before you step foot in the door so my advice, make sure to do some vetting before you accept an offer here. 

Second, while the... company is great at tackling challenges outside of the organization, there is a significant amount  of work to be done on diversity and inclusion front. Let me explain: If you are a cis White male, you will have countless opportunities at your disposal even if you lack the education, experience or credentials. Leadership within the organization is akin to a fraternity where youre accepted based on whether youre liked by management  and not by how hard you work. 

This moves me to my next point - women and minorities in leadership. Of the 19k+ employees worldwide, Black employees make up less than 3.8% of the workforce. Latino demographics are slightly higher perhaps by a base point or two. Asians account for roughly 7-8% I believe. 

While you will see minorities scattered throughout the organization, the reality that few of them achieve leadership success within the organization is certainly true. For women of color, especially Black women of color, the harsh reality is even fewer achieve leadership success despite many of them having stellar performance reviews and tenured experience.  

Retention for women and minorities is even more of a joke. Countless number of women and minorities are leaving the company because of the cis white male hegemony present within the organization."
"2432","Poor management, unrealistic targets, non client focused, poor bonus structure"
"2433","Unreasonable sales pressure at times."
"2434","Resources are becoming severely stretched as the company grows. Micro managers need to be stamped out because not conducive to a vibrant and creative workforce. Stifling ideas and decisions creates resentment and lack of empowerment. Promoting career paths needs more emphasis. There are some really hard working + creative workers at various levels  so management needs to be  better at retaining the staff. A high... attrition rate says a lot."
"2435","Difficult to rise to certain areas of the firm, culture of fear in certain departments."
"2436","Sometimes to much micromanagement and overlapping"

Web is up and coming here though, but at the moment there's only a few rare sweet spots in the company that are playing with a modern web stack. If you're looking for bean bags and ping pong tables, you'll find none of that here. But you will find a nice... fat check, extremely smart people, and really nothing to complain about. Just apply. You'll thank me later."

"2456","The thing that strikes me is that Bloomberg is a pretty good place to work, but could be so much better some real leadership, but never will. The simplified main issues come down to:

- No true leadership or management from the top down & zero culture of communication 
- Total disempowerment of employees and no willingness to take risks
- Now, now, now instead of stop and think for 2 minutes (or god forbid... using data and information to make decisions)
- Total lack of transparency on everything (mainly salary and career) despite claiming to be THE transparent company 

And the two things that make all of this worse 
1) the company generally thinks it does all of the above well, which makes it inauthentic because everyone knows it doesn't
2) nobody really cares that much to change any of it.

Leadership & Management
I have never seen such a successful a company so successful with such poor management, leadership and communication culture. Poor isn't really the right word really. It's more non-existent. 

You rarely hear from senior positions on the direction of various areas of the business, and if you do it's in a once or twice a year email. The generally held belief that I have heard stated numerous times is ""people will figure it out. Tell their manager and it will filter through"". 

There is a pervasive belief that the company is still a startup, so we will just email people and they will get the memo. But nobody really gets the memo and it creates mass confusion on what everyone is and/or should be doing. It's kind of like Where's Waldo (Where's Wally for the Brits), where you're trying to find Waldo, but looking around and wondering what the hell is going on in this picture only to realise it's mass chaos. 

They still do things from when the company first started in the 80s and beat the chest about it, even though most people look around and go, really? Maybe we should look at what is being done now? But as you will see below, there is zero desire to change anything as it works for the most senior of management (but nobody else). 

On the inauthentic piece above, this is actually the one area where they don't really claim to be great. It's sort of, yeah we aren't really good and don't really care about improving. 

Disempowerment & Taking Risks
The lack of empowerment with most people is daily and widespread, with few able to make their own decisions beyond what their favourite snack is (Amazed btw at how many pro comments are simply just 'the snacks are amazing). Doing things that will rock the boat? Never, despite the fact that is what the company needs. As stated, the worst part about this is how much the company promotes taking risks, trying new things, and not wanting the status quo, which is pretty much all anyone ever gets. 

Now, now, now 
So few people stop and take the time to do things that make sense. The company has been largely successful for many years, and there is a level of arrogance that Bloomberg is unassailable to disruption. Seeing companies like Reuters and others go through challenging times makes people even more bold in that position. I have truly never seen a company so bold in it's self-ego when customers are publicly stating they want to get rid of Bloomberg and form side companies to try and unseat the incumbent. 

You would think that would make people stop and look at trends, analyse the situation and then make decision. The Bloomberg Way is go out and do and the good times will roll. Except that they don't and things are vastly less successful than they could be. 

Lack of transparency 
Despite claiming to be the company that essentially invented transparency it is one of the least transparent places I have ever worked. On a purely salary and HR level, there is absolutely no understanding of how you are paid, what you need to do to improve that, etc. 

There are minimal opportunities to advance outside of being a 'Team Leader' which offers no real benefit because they have no culture of management so nobody knows how to do it properly. Again - let the people just figure it out, which would be fine if the company were 180 but it is 18,000. 

Case in point, the internal idea board where employees could share any idea about something, from I think we should have a family day to why don't they have a gym in the building, was removed last year because 'management communication practices and ticketing systems' were in place to flag issues. What that means is employees have no place to voice concerns or raise issues. HR is non-existent and ombudsman. 

Inauthenticity & Desire to Improve
This is the hardest piece to swallow as an employee. The company is simply inauthentic in its culture these days and is totally out of touch with the employee base.  Even things like how active Bloomberg is in diversity & inclusion, there are tons of elements where Bloomberg beats there own chest where they could be so much more ahead of the curve. 

Employees used to believe in what was being sold and no matter how manic things would get, they felt it and wanted to be a part of it. But the human element has gone and with all of things outlined above, people no longer feel it. People will stay of course as they have created the classic comfortable-enough pay structure, but they will never keep real talent there. I think another review said 'fake it till you make it' and that is 100% true. 

Amazingly, employees want a lot of the things listed above and there is simply zero desire to do so.  It all works for management and things keep going with the bottom line improving, but there will come a tipping point where it may not be tenable."

Global Data department is one of the worst department to be in. 
The branding and job description is attractive, with all the buzz words like ""python"", ""big data"", and align with the focus on data-driven world nowadays. BUT, your day to day job literally revolves around mainly manually inputting data into the terminal, or making sure vendors doesn't input wrong... data into the terminal. 

They claim you get to learn ""data-skills"", but the reality is, even if you know python/SQL/R, you will get very limited channels to utilize & improve these hard skills.

Plus, they now pay people with python/SQL/R skills higher than those people who don't have these hard skills, and WORST OF ALL, there's NO career path for people who want to learn these hard skills to improve in their careers.

Global Data is seen as a cost-center in the company, and the whole department desperately needs to prove themselves to be worthy all the time. Thus, there is a huge emphasis on flashy quick ""wins"". 
It is not exaggerating that senior management puts emphasis on the quantity & list of wins the department can generate, rather than the quality of work (less errors in data)

An example of a win that demonstrate the  would be: helped out sales/news do their jobs. And whoever is able to pile up a huge list of these related wins will be evaluated favorably even if he/she doesn't do a good job maintaining the data quality. And those who does put in effort to make sure data quality is good will always be viewed as a liability because of the lack of wins

Also, politics (mainly nepotism)... within one year, literally, some of the best & top leaders all was gone (either left the company or department). And to replace those roles, the top management just put in their own friends instead of really looking for the right person to lead.

There's no career paths, and rumors around the company cutting costs seems to be proving true as they let a lot of long-term employees go without much explanations. Just a bad place to work"
"2491","too many managers. information asymmetry among employees."
"2492","Use antiquated or proprietary technologies day to day. Managers only promote people of same background as themselves"
"2493","Can be hard to find your way, things are not ha fed to you initially."
"2494","For the candidates taking interviews or considering the offer of Market Data Analyst or other Global Data related position, I suggest you making up your mind of what you expect to gain from this job.

First off, let's begin with daily work. As an analyst in Global Data, it is inevitable for you to take up some manual data entry or maintenance works and the volume depends on which team you will be assigned. For... example corporate actions team is well known for it notoriously huge amount of daily work such as resolving helpdesk tickets, clearing workitems from the queue in processing tool etc. Fundamental or Estimate teams will involve less helpdesk ticket resolving but more on value tagging (or correction of value tagging by vendors) from company financial or broker researches. Now for every new hire, they will be labelled as ""level 1"" for the first 2 years of tenure with the performance metrics focusing on daily operations productivity. After staying for 2 years you will progress into ""level 2"" with more metrics on projects you lead or initiate.

You should have a psychological preparation about the discrepancy between what has been advertised in job description and the actual daily operations. As a rule of thumb, please pay attention to the first few points listed in the job duty section in a job advertisement because usually they account for the majority of you daily tasks. In terms of ""interesting"" projects leveraging your data analysis and programming skills, well.. you can see them among the bottom of job duty section and so you should know what I mean. Of course if you satisfy with data entry and maintenance experience learnt from this position, I think it is a great job for you referring to my Pros above. However if you aim at sharpening your data analysis skills and developing programming expertise through some data science projects, think twice...

In fact, the mismatch of expectation explained above is one of the major reasons why there has been such a high turnover rate in this department, and even more devastating during 2018. Global Data did hire some strong candidates with sound Python/R expertise and data management background. But as the previous reviews said, due to numerous roadblocks including but not limited to: clumsy internal procedures to request access to database or even the installation of latest library; predefined preference (or limitation) of platform where you have to code/develop such as BQL/BQNT/DTP etc, such strong candidates are destined to leave soon out of frustration, disappointment and boredom.

Another group of attrition focuses on those who equipped with 3+ years of market knowledge and product specific experience. Internally we refer to ""Subject Matter Expert"" aka SME. Without these SME who excel at asset classes they cover to co-lead the data analysis, auto news generation or process efficiency projects, the quality of final deliverable could be hideous and sometimes is utterly a joke to our client's eyes. A news article citing the valuation of insurance sector health based on P/E ration could be published, unchecked, unchallenged by the analysts, due to the fact that if there is a SME ever he or she will correct your logic to use P/B since it is kind of a well known industry practice if you ask any client from equity research covering insurance sector!

Do not expect you team leader would have more market knowledge nor tech skills than you or any analyst to give you some useful advice, simply thanks to the unique management culture in Bloomberg. While Data emphasizes so much on engaging tech stack, very few, if not none, of the team leaders knows how to code in Python or other languages. Be prepared for yourself to be constantly asked by your team leader during bi-weekly catchup with one FAQ: Is there any project you want to do? I bet you a facepalm if you are conscious enough to ask this yourself: Isn't it supposed to be the TL who should possess in-depth product knowledge and insight to help initiate project ideas and assign to analysts according to their different skill sets, rather than ask analysts to contribute ideas simply because the TL has none?

If you read through the long article and arrive at here, I truly appreciate your effort invested in researching this company or global data. All things considered, if you do not mind of steep learning curve and value your learning opportunity and exposure to the true big data analysis and data science, go somewhere else because I am sure there are many great companies out there with a team full of supportive, competent and visionary seniors and managers who truly know what data science is. If you only look for a fresh graduate job with a beat-the-market starting salary, I wholeheartedly suggest you think about your exit strategy starting from as soon as your onboard date. We have long lost the job stability with a clear observation last year about the layoff of a bunch of news reporters and even managers who worked for more than 12-15 years, just before the 10Bln long term bonus payout in this March."
"2495","There's a thick layer of inexperienced middle management despite fancy titles. Most have been there forever, and have limited or no corporate and professional experience outside of the company. As there are a lot of them, they are unable to grow or learn from each other, instead reinforcing a somewhat immature, weak and incompetent style of leadership. Interestingly, the upper management is much stronger and have... solid strategy.. no surprise that most of them are hired from outside the co."
"2496","But there's a rule for everything at Bloomberg that's paralyzing and has highly competent, intelligent professionals constantly feeling the need to seek affirmation of a half dozen leaders/authorities before acting.  In my role,  for instance, I've got 4-5 people to manage but 5-6 bosses. It's a much different vibe than anywhere I've been.  Also say ""adios"" to your personal time. If you commute, expect a 12-14 hour... day. Bloomberg has finally evolved with the times a bit by allowing people to telecommute here and there, but each day is drudgery.  Instead of fixing a simply typo of a company name, for instance, the offender deals with a belabored, almost embarrassing process of having to re-run a story with the correction, deleting the old one off the system, then writing a letter to several managers to detail exactly what went wrong; so God forbid you spell it Proctor & Gamble instead of Procter & Gamble -- total rabbit hole that eats up tons of time and distracts. This is where Bloomberg takes its mantra of being candid to unproductive extremes and creates a sense of arrogance among the higher-ups that what Bloomberg does is above the level of its rivals. It's utter nonsense, as is the sense that employees can be rated based on cockeyed data points focused on production levels rather than quality of the work."

People not treated like human beings (e.g. team that... doesn't say hi or bye, useless meeting culture where meetings mean you're always busy a.k.a. important).

"2518","Long hours, Internal politics, micromanagement"
"2519","* Sales ability to construct and negotiate on deals is getting better with a move towards book-of-business enterprise sales, but still remains inflexible compared to most other technology/enterprise sales roles. This limits a sales person's autonomy and personal development with things like deal and proposal construction.

* Whilst management maintains an 'informal' policy towards working remotely it is still seen... across the sales department as inflexible and something that should be asked for on an infrequent basis. Traditional in-office culture of first-in, last-out will probably live on until there is a change in senior management. This has been a top reason for attrition over many years as other companies embrace this.

* Sales people must be prepared to put in significant time and effort to learn the full suite of Bloomberg solutions (which is vast) in order to be successful in hitting targets. Gone are the days (thankfully) of silo'd sales groups within the company, where core terminal sales sold/serviced the terminal only. Enterprise selling is a welcome change.

* Bloomberg's product range is vast - both on and off terminal. The ability for the company to move nimbly and pragmatically in response to an industry challenge such as regulation (e.g. Mifid II) has proven to be difficult with so many product verticals and groups behind each not talking/working in tandem. Can lead to often frustrating and fragmented engagements with clients looking for holistic solutions. This has been acknowledged at a high level and continues to be a focus.

* Senior management are often not the most dynamic in terms of employee (in my case sales force) engagement. Would love to see more engaging, higher energy motivational sales meetings / wraps / town halls. Can often be down-beat and lacking positive energy."

"2527","Let me start by saying my time at Bloomberg did not start off as bad as it eventually got. Once you start off as a ""financial analytics"" representative they provide you with training which makes you feel like you're learning a lot about finance. In reality they are only teaching you how to use the Bloomberg terminal which is an outdated piece of software from the 80s with an offensive user interface. The name... ""financial analytics"" representative really stands for customer service representative. You work at the help desk. Your entire day is answering tons customer service ""tickets"" that come into the help desk. There is nothing analytical or financial about this  position. When a financial professional comes into the help desk Its your job to search the terminal (most of the time literally searching in the search bar) to find whatever number or news story they are looking for. All you do for 8/9 hours a day is answer help desk questions for clients who 90% of the time are rude and in a hurry for the answer because they value their time much more than yours. 

Here is where the ""toxic"" work culture comes from. Every morning that you log in you have a dashboard of your 10+ metrics which are constantly being compared to your coworkers. if your numbers are even percentage lower than your ""peer average"" prepare to be constantly reminded by your managers to get your customer satisfaction numbers up. Coworkers check each others dashboards to make sure their metrics are better to avoid being in the bottom 10%. Management takes that bottom 10% and will put them on a performance plan and even threaten to terminate their employment. Management uses manipulative tactics to make sure their employees are solving as many ""tickets"" as humanly possible, like you are a robot. 

I understand a job can be stressful, I understand that as an employee you are required to perform for the company. But I have never seen a company where people come in and leave with a constant feeling of anxiety that they need to out perform their peers and stretch themselves to a limit to hit metrics. This is not a sales, finance, or analytical job. This is a over the top and extremely stressful customer service job."

It started feelings I had gotten a dream job, in a dream company with amazing growing prospects and I finished in therapy, taking anxiety pills and hating my life every single day.

BCS, as they call the department, passed through a lot of changes on the past few years, it basically started to take a lot... of work that was previously done by other departments, so that caused a lot of dissatisfaction among the people that used to work there for a long time and eventually a mass exodus.

The truth is, BCS management don't know what they are doing, BCS keeps taking more and more work from other departments and salaries don't go up accordingly, rules and procedures change in a weekly basis and people end up very confused.

Micromanagement is a huge problem, employees are strictly controlled from the minute they start until the minute they finish, 2 extra minutes that is taken in the bathroom or commuting in the morning is counted and people are punished for that but, if employees stay stuck in a call with a client for 20 minutes after their shifts, it's considered part of the business"" and people cant ask that time back.

On the interview it was never mentioned that it was mandatory to work on weekends at least once a month, otherwise I would have not taken the position. 

Holidays are taken by scale and no more than 15 people can be on holidays at the same time, which makes an absolute nightmare to take some days off, especially during the summer and Christmas. I can't count how many times I had to cancel or miss holidays with family and friends because of that. Again, it was never mentioned on the interview otherwise that would be a deal breaker for me.

Most of people in the department only put up with being in that fancy call centre because they know it's a start to go somewhere higher up in the company but, people don't progress unless they are popular and do a lot of socialising around. The idea of progressing someone because the person deserves it or worked hard for it doesn't exist in BCS, if the person doesn't socialise, they won't go anywhere.

Overall, a vey negative environment to work in, most people are unhappy there just waiting for the first opportunity to leave the department or to leave the company. Ive seen so many people developing depression and anxiety on this role including me, people taking long sick leaves and eventually leaving the company a few weeks after theyre back to work because they just could not handle suck a toxic workplace.

Trust me when I say that you're not doing anything finance related. You're in a back-office role doing manual data entry which can be automated at any time. In fact, Bloomberg is pushing for automation so I wouldn't be surprised to see Global Data dissolved.... Also it really matters which team you land on. No matter what, STAY AWAY from fixed income. Specifically the mortgages team and to some extent bonds. You'll be going through all the same issues as everyone else in Global Data but with A LOT more work than your non-fixed income colleagues. Besides Global Data being a joke, be prepared to face A LOT of politics. There's politics all over the place. Since there's so many fresh college grads, it feels like college with college drama. ""Senior leaders"" are outdated. Some have been with the company for several decades simply because of their connections. In fact, since there's so many people for so few TL spots, the only way to move up is to be friends with management. You get ""unlimited sick days"" but no one takes them because there's a stigma. If you do end up taking one, if it's Friday or Monday, be ready to face judgement when you're back. Work from home is also so so hard to get. It's pretty basic these for companies to offer this, but the company doesn't want to set a standard of working from home daily. Thus, managers are encouraged to not let their teams work from home. As for career prospects after, there's very little. Poor at best. Think about it, you're not doing finance so no banks want you. Since you're doing data entry all day, you're not developing technical or finance skills. Also you're working with Bloomberg systems which isn't applicable to other companies. If you were working with SAP, Qlik, Tableau then that would actually be useful but you're not. Lastly, the location sucks. You're not in Princeton, you're in freaking- Skillman, New Jersey. Never heard of it? Exactly."
"2574","Like any big companies, you need to be clear in the company's goals and directions in short and long terms, and adopt yourself to the changes quickly."
"2575","Flat hierarchy and limited senior roles"
"2576","Nepotistic culture, no transparency. The company steals client data and monitors clients behaviors. A bad manager can do what he likes and the company will cover him irrespective of your complaints."
"2577","If you are unlucky and end up on the wrong team, it can be extremely micro managed. Because everyone in the company can view your calendar, see what time you badged in and out, this is used extensively by managers, so basically for people with family and kids, can be a proper nightmare"

"2594","Não vejo nenhuma desvantagem na empresa."
"2595","The culture at Bloomberg is very mixed. There is a segment of the company that is genuinely interested in leveraging cutting edge technology and making an impact. However, there is an equally large segment of the company that is reluctant to relinquish the practices theyve been using since the mid 90s. For example, many teams use relatively modern python; but there were times where I encountered teams with no... interest with updating their Linux incompatible C++93. The company has largely stagnated between these opposing factions.

Theres also a mediocre to at times hostile work environment for engineers belonging to underrepresented groups. The workforce is largely male and there are almost no engineers from ethnically underrepresented groups. This can create a lonely environment as the undiverse management doesnt seem interested in going beyond lip service."
"2596","Can be a high pressure environment."
"2597","Value your employees"
"2598","A lot of old, legacy code, which moves slowly."

"2602","Business managers are not great"
"2603","Micromanagement, lots of commitment"
"2604","There are regular major reorganisations which result in people's job responsibilities and reporting lines changing. This is frustrating since you never know what you're doing to be doing six months from now - it might be a completely different job from the one you were hired for.  This is apparently ""The Bloomberg Way"" but it seems to me that doing things ""The Bloomberg Way"" is an excuse for poor management... decisions to get implemented without recourse for employees. 

There are way too many management levels and the people that make decisions don't know the right ones to make. 

The salary bands are invisible to employees (if they even have them - salaries seem to be completely arbitrary here) and negotiating pay rises is almost impossible since pay rise is already decided when you get to review period. If you're an internal employee who has moved around, don't expect to be paid anywhere near your colleagues who have come in from external.

It's really difficult to move into a department unless you already know someone there - it's who you know, not what you know. 

People with more tenure get preferential treatment for some reason, even if they are toxic.

Working hours are ridiculous - such an outdated way of working. There's only so many productive hours in a day and making people stay in an office from 8am to 6pm does not increase those hours."
"2605","Navigating career progression is further complicated by Bloombergs lack of hierarchy so it seems to be more about who you know"
"2606","-No clear track for success/moving up the ladder. 
-Performance reviews/promotions seem to be very subjective and not very quantifiable.
-Much of the leadership is ancient and has been at the company for decade(s) so not much room for growth and no true desire to innovate.
-Very outdated and proprietary tech stack.
-Using internal tools and the terminal daily is a pain.
-Pay/perks a tier below the other big... tech companies
-Very much of a corporate and finance vibe in 731 Lex."
"2607","Very competitive and cut throat, hard work is expected and not rewarded"
"2608","No true training or development outside of product training for sales, they move you around laterally to different product teams like a chess piece however there is no real progression. Do not encourage but rather view professional certification or upskilling outside of Bloomberg products with suspicion. Internal barriers to complete deals or small sales are sometimes enormous. Management keep chiming about office... being a meritocracy to justify a metric driven system for performance review however what really matters is how much you can BS your way to the top by ""telling a story""."

Company not doing well financially. Majority of higher ups are white males. Sexist. Issue with harassment. And lack of diversity especially in management positions"
"2614","If you are going there. Just keep this in mind. You can be Albert Einstein and be smartest in the world but you don't get promoted  easily. Here Everything works based on relationships.

"2623","slow promotion, frequent structural changes"
"2624","Very slow moving, bureaucratic organization"
"2625","Bloomberg is more of a cult than a company. You'll be expected to dedicate yourself and your life to Michael Bloomberg and his philanthropic ventures. There's no such thing as work-life balance at Bloomberg, just work-work. While you may be scheduled to work 9 hour days (don't even think about taking a lunch break) it's more likely you'll be working 10 hour days and 11 and 12 hour days are not uncommon. For all that... hard work and effort you'll be rewarded with zero job security. Loyalty is very much a one-way street at Bloomberg and layoffs are routine. Your future is solely dependent on your manager, and they change often. My first 6 reviews at Bloomberg were written by 6 different bosses. If you get one that takes a dislike to you, regardless of your performance, you're toast. I've seen hard-working, talented employees get the boot while workers who literally spend the day on their Facebook page, texting and take 2 hour lunches keep their jobs. Additionally, if you're over 50 your days are numbered. Yes, the company that prides itself on its philanthropic initiatives routinely practices age discrimination."

People don't know how to manage other people
Little diversity in engineering - witnessed 2 women get let go in a department of about 40 men, leaving only 1 woman on the team
No work life balance - long hours expected, working from home frowned upon unless you are your... manager's 'favorite'
Financial Products office team is verbally abusive, witnessed cursing, yelling/screaming, unprofessional rants many times, in person and over calls, was hung up on by a colleague because he was ""not happy""
Lack of training and adequate ramp up time to learn the Bloomberg Terminal
So many people working there are long timers - been there since they graduated college...so it's hard to find people who are open minded or well rounded, they only know the Bloomberg way and they are unwilling or unable to change or embrace new ideas even though they push 'innovation' down your throat 24/7
Departments are immature and unwilling to consider changes to process, also unwilling to use any tools outside of the Bloomberg Terminal or that are not proprietary to the company
Management forces use of outdated process and software and does not embrace using the best tools out there or use even best practices
They would rather you fit their style of work and not bring new ideas to the table

"2654","You can progress your role into manager and even higher but if you plan to have a career in finance or quantitative analytics, it might be a challenge or will take a long time. Your role can progress but your career will be stagnant and be stuck in customer service.

Admin/Customer Service disguised as ""Analyst"" Job.

Claim to be a tech company but relies heavily on Excel. If Microsoft takes out Excel, Bloomberg... will shut down along with the world market that relies on Bloomberg data.

Not a finance job but a financial product ambassador; people do modelling and financial analysis but it is just to make ""clients"" have ease of use and show more functionality for the terminal. Analyst/Analytics here is synonymous to knowing what the client/customer needs and not necessarily include any quantitative analysis. Might be less than 5% that quantitative analysis will be required for an Analyst job."
"2655","they just dont care about the health or wellbeing of analytics reps. we had an earthquake evacuation drill, they made me us stay at our desks while the alarm screamed and the lights flashed, while the rest of the building evacuated.  they dehumanize the reps, the SF analytics department head carries a sweatshop mentality and everybody hates her for it"

"2660","First, let's get the job description straight. If you choose to join the analytics program you will be a customer service representative where you will be ""on queue"".

""CALL ME""
""My launchpad is broken""
""Can you confirm the IPO... date 943819 US Equity was on 9/8/2017?""

However, it's truly the management that lack of empathy that creates an environment that makes the desk an inky black hole where every molecule of light/joy cannot escape. A few examples include:
-Time off has to be asked 120 days in advance no matter the situation during the holidays/summer
-No breaks (including the bathroom) are to be given if the queue is busy
-Genuine disregard for the emotions, aspirations, and general well being of employees.

I've been with them for over a decade and have gotten to see this company get worse over the years. It used to be a great company that looked after its employees, but over last 2 years they have been looking to get rid of... anyone with a decent salary and tenure. Have been replacing with kids out of college at a fraction of the salary and zero experience then working them to death, turnover is staggering with very high numbers of new recruits leaving within the first 2 years.   Sales managers have almost no experience of selling and are promoted only for their micro management prowess. 

Sales targets are ridiculous and they count net performance,  that means that salesperson takes a hit for any removals, but gets NO credit for renewals.  Sales is blamed for every removal even though product teams have not developed a decent product in almost a decade, and are obsessed with growing revenue even though there is no new product/service to help in the growth. So their strategy has been to double/triple/quadruple prices for existing services which makes it extremely difficult to have any new sales discussion with this clients, then blame is laid upon the sales force for not hitting ridiculous targets."
