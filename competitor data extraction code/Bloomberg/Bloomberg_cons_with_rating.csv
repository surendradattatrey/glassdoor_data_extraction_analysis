"4","What little journalistic talent remains at Bloomberg News is no match for the mass of mediocrity that has risen up there. In the past five years, the standard of quality has gone from excruciatingly high to preposterously low. 

While political correctness and identity politics run rampant, gender discrimination is still quite prevalent, despite all the internal corporate propaganda stating otherwise. And nobody,... man nor woman, should feel comfortable growing old there. Experience has become a liability as the company is clearly focused on lowering the average age (and salary) of non-management employees through attrition, targeted layoffs and firings.

You shouldn’t consider Bloomberg News as a mid-career journalist. If you’re age 40 or older, don’t even bother applying. You probably won't even land an interview, let alone get hired. They have been actively recruiting minorities and LGBTQ people, though. So there might be some exceptions if you fit any of those categories. It does seem like a good fit for a kid just out of college looking to get some experience and then move on to something better. Sadly, it’s become that kind of place."

However, it's truly the management that lack of empathy that creates an environment that makes the desk an inky black hole where every molecule of light/joy cannot escape. A few examples include:
-Time off has to be asked 120 days in advance no matter the situation during the holidays/summer
-No breaks (including the bathroom) are to be given if the queue is busy

I've been with them for over a decade and have gotten to see this company get worse over the years. It used to be a great company that looked after its employees, but over last 2 years they have been looking to get rid of... anyone with a decent salary and tenure. Have been replacing with kids out of college at a fraction of the salary and zero experience then working them to death, turnover is staggering with very high numbers of new recruits leaving within the first 2 years.   Sales managers have almost no experience of selling and are promoted only for their micro management prowess. 

Sales targets are ridiculous and they count net performance,  that means that salesperson takes a hit for any removals, but gets NO credit for renewals.  Sales is blamed for every removal even though product teams have not developed a decent product in almost a decade, and are obsessed with growing revenue even though there is no new product/service to help in the growth. So their strategy has been to double/triple/quadruple prices for existing services which makes it extremely difficult to have any new sales discussion with this clients, then blame is laid upon the sales force for not hitting ridiculous targets."

Claim to be a tech company but relies heavily on Excel. If Microsoft takes out Excel, Bloomberg... will shut down along with the world market that relies on Bloomberg data.

Not a finance job but a financial product ambassador; people do modelling and financial analysis but it is just to make ""clients"" have ease of use and show more functionality for the terminal.

There's no such thing as work-life balance at Bloomberg, just work-work. While you may be scheduled to work 9 hour days (don't even think about taking a lunch break) it's more likely you'll be working 10 hour days and 11 and 12 hour days are not uncommon. For all that... hard work and effort you'll be rewarded with zero job security. Loyalty is very much a one-way street at Bloomberg and layoffs are routine. Your future is solely dependent on your manager, and they change often. My first 6 reviews at Bloomberg were written by 6 different bosses. If you get one that takes a dislike to you, regardless of your performance, you're toast. I've seen hard-working, talented employees get the boot while workers who literally spend the day on their Facebook page, texting and take 2 hour lunches keep their jobs. Additionally, if you're over 50 your days are numbered. Yes, the company that prides itself on its philanthropic initiatives routinely practices age discrimination."

"110","Everything about the actual job in this company is bad. Even though I am writing about the Data department, it is true for the whole company.

1) Misleading job advert – they market roles at Bloomberg using fake titles, like ‘Global Data Analyst’, ‘Financial Product Sales and Analytics’, which sound nice, but the jobs you actually do for the first title is literally data entry + customer service, for the second... title it is entirely customer service (you are the person on the other end of HELP HELP key). Roles should instead be called ‘Data entry specialist’ and ‘Call center representative’. 
2) Incredibly dull, repetitive and unstimulating job. This is the most non-serious job I have ever had since handing out leaflets in high school. 70% of the work day revolved around routing clients’ questions, asked via HELP HELP function (aka ‘tickets’) to different teams depending on the content of the question. Many times the split of the departments into teams did not make any sense, and you were essentially paid for learning the peculiarities of such a division. My fellow colleagues were answering these questions and manually entering the data into the terminal. The next day the whole procedure is repeated. 30% are left for ‘projects’, which are usually interesting and you have incredibly high degree of freedom as team leaders and managers (the bottom 2 layers of hierarchy) do not have a clue about anything. The job can be done without any degree, yet most of the people there have good masters due to selective application process.
3) Big brother atmosphere/micromanagement. Bloomberg does not trust its employees at any levels. All the decisions are made in the US. Other offices sometimes even get notified of these decisions late, let alone being allowed to take part in the decision making process. The company also monitors and tries to monitor every single aspect of your day, and that sometimes reaches grotesque forms. Examples are timing your time taking tickets, publicly displaying the time you badged in on your profile, being told off when you come in at 8:01, getting emails & messages from your managers when you spend ‘too much’ time in the bathroom (applicable to Analytics department). You will most likely have a timetable, where every hour of your day, including lunch, will be strictly scheduled, and doing/not doing what you are assigned is tracked using a variety of statistical measures. Other reviews mention microphones and reading your emails, I don’t have any proof of that, but would not be very surprised to find that out.
4) Incompetent TLs and managers. Because of all the above, there is significant brain drain from the department and the company in general. The smartest colleagues tend to leave very quickly realizing how bad it is. The ones who can’t leave usually stay and become team leaders, thus promoting adverse selection to management roles. As a result of this, there is no real leadership in the company, your TL will likely be less intelligent than you, knowing nothing about the subject, and his/her only competency will be monitoring your metrics and alerting you when you are 1 minute late from lunch/took too many minutes in the toilet. As you usually reach TL level after 4-5 years within the company, these people realise they are not employable anywhere else due to the nature of their skill set and hence become extremely risk averse and will do anything to maintain the status quo and save their job, stifling all the innovation. You will hear phrases like ‘Go ahead only if this doesn’t change much’ a lot.  Team Leaders who are not performing well in one team, will be laterally moved to another team, so team leaders in lets say Fixed Income team can come from HR, studying HR at a random university.
5) No career path/no exit opportunities. If you are looking to move internally – the company actually encourages this, but all the roles in data are more or less the same, so you would not avoid manual data entry and customer service, thus being stuck doing absolutely unskilled tasks. Only exceptions are data science teams, which also do not do anything outstanding, but at least do not have this entry and customer service parts. But because everyone wants to move there, you may need to wait 3+ years just to make a lateral move to an entry-level position without any salary increase. If you are looking outside, the common exit opportunities are back office jobs or other data providers, where you do more or less the same job. You will have to embellish your responsibilities at Bloomberg during your interviews if you do not want to look like a waiter applying for finance jobs. 
6) Absolutely not working incentive scheme. Bloomberg has a very strange culture where everyone receives roughly the same salary and where everyone receives roughly same raises every year, no matter how well you perform. If you are a top performer, your bonus will likely be literally 0-£200 higher than the bad performer and the raise you get will be just £1000 per year more. This creates no incentives to work beyond the stipulated time/work hard or work smart. You will get the same in the end.
7) Promotions based on connections. In many times, the promotions are actually decided based on how people like you instead of how good you are or how suitable your skill set is."

"115","* Micromanagement on steroids. Cameras everywhere, key strokes monitored and the time you are in the office is also measured. Make no mistake if you are one minute late expect to get an email.

* BULLYING CULTURE....it is sad to watch people who are elevated to management embrace the culture and start sending emails to people who were once friends about Bloomberg standards (which are Gilead like), social media... responsibility (apply self censorship muzzle here) and writing news stories that resemble bullet points so as to keep your metrics up.

* On social media, the transgressions from personal twitter accounts were so trivial that most either stopped using social media or found alternate employment.

* SHOUTING AT STAFF IS GOOD...APPARENTLY? !!!!! Any organisation where screaming at subordinates is considered standard is one that will result in the victim seeking some form of medication, treatment, and having their self worth destroyed.....or they embrace the same behavior. Bloomberg is full of bullying managers who cannot leave their staff alone to do their jobs....constant hectoring and poor processes only compound the problem.

* POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AT A LEVEL APPROACHING MADNESS - Mike Bloomberg's weird personal views on workplace loyalty, climate change and a decent society is where the organization shaped in his likeness reaches rank hypocrisy. Despite the wacky obsession about sugary drinks in New York, the wall of sugar at the company's hideous neon offices are a reminder to never leave and drink soda for 12 hours (sorry, 14 hours a day).

*  Bloomberg LP has been sued many times for being hostile to women, especially pregnant women. Despite the PR about how the company has embraced flexibility, such pieces are complete fiction and do not tell the real story of what happens when many women return from maternity leave. Feel free to read the NY Times to get the company view on females who dare to have a baby. 'Mayor Shows His Testy Side in Deposition for a Lawsuit' on April 14, 2011.'

* CLIMATE CHANGE HYPOCRISY - Bloomberg LP relies on terminal sales to many industries and takes money from BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore, Whitehaven Coal....wait! yes coal companies whom Mike Bloomberg wants to shut down. (Mike is annoyed that people are apathetic about the approaching apocalypse but like children who rebel against religious parents it is simply a case of normal folk rebelling against having an issue shoved down their throat by billionaires. Nothing gets a Bloomberg editor giddy around the loins like the image of Hollywood stars flying in private jets to exclusive resorts to give lectures on climate and consumerism. It is amazing the air time given to people who wear spandex and pose in front of green screens for a living. 

* Like Gilead, Bloomberg has an army of Editors at Large (commanders)......this is code for former Team Leaders and Bureau Chiefs who have been kept on to write 2000 word op-eds no one reads and to hold forth in strategy sessions about what politics mean for a given country. The Sydney bureau is blessed with several Commanders in these roles as its leadership wrestles with the most gripping issue facing the island nation........Australia's misogyny problem. Month after month, the Sydney bureau's self-flagellation results in snore fests of how to get women into management positions......forget the economy, this is where the real new stories are at!  (it was amazing to learn that outside the Bloomberg offices, there are men walking down the road holding their wife or girlfriend's hand.......there is hope for Australia yet).

* Not to be outdone, the London bureau have a cool social club....the LGBTQI_Women_Climate_Change_More_Women_in_Leadership_Diversity Social Club.....sadly I didn't get to join this social club.....

Trust me when I say that you're not doing anything finance related. You're in a back-office role doing manual data entry which can be automated at any time. In fact, Bloomberg is pushing for automation so I wouldn't be surprised to see Global Data dissolved.... Also it really matters which team you land on. No matter what, STAY AWAY from fixed income. Specifically the mortgages team and to some extent bonds. You'll be going through all the same issues as everyone else in Global Data but with A LOT more work than your non-fixed income colleagues. Besides Global Data being a joke, be prepared to face A LOT of politics. There's politics all over the place. Since there's so many fresh college grads, it feels like college with college drama. ""Senior leaders"" are outdated. Some have been with the company for several decades simply because of their connections. In fact, since there's so many people for so few TL spots, the only way to move up is to be friends with management. You get ""unlimited sick days"" but no one takes them because there's a stigma. If you do end up taking one, if it's Friday or Monday, be ready to face judgement when you're back. Work from home is also so so hard to get. It's pretty basic these for companies to offer this, but the company doesn't want to set a standard of working from home daily. Thus, managers are encouraged to not let their teams work from home. As for career prospects after, there's very little. Poor at best. Think about it, you're not doing finance so no banks want you. Since you're doing data entry all day, you're not developing technical or finance skills. Also you're working with Bloomberg systems which isn't applicable to other companies. If you were working with SAP, Qlik, Tableau then that would actually be useful but you're not. Lastly, the location sucks. You're not in Princeton, you're in freaking- Skillman, New Jersey.

It started feelings I had gotten a dream job, in a dream company with amazing growing prospects and I finished in therapy, taking anxiety pills and hating my life every single day.

BCS, as they call the department, passed through a lot of changes on the past few years, it basically started to take a lot... of work that was previously done by other departments, so that caused a lot of dissatisfaction among the people that used to work there for a long time and eventually a mass exodus.

The truth is, BCS management don't know what they are doing, BCS keeps taking more and more work from other departments and salaries don't go up accordingly, rules and procedures change in a weekly basis and people end up very confused.

Micromanagement is a huge problem, employees are strictly controlled from the minute they start until the minute they finish, 2 extra minutes that is taken in the bathroom or commuting in the morning is counted and people are punished for that but, if employees stay stuck in a call with a client for 20 minutes after their shifts, it's considered “part of the business"" and people can’t ask that time back.

On the interview it was never mentioned that it was mandatory to work on weekends at least once a month, otherwise I would have not taken the position. 

Holidays are taken by scale and no more than 15 people can be on holidays at the same time, which makes an absolute nightmare to take some days off, especially during the summer and Christmas. I can't count how many times I had to cancel or miss holidays with family and friends because of that. Again, it was never mentioned on the interview otherwise that would be a deal breaker for me.

Most of people in the department only put up with being in that fancy call centre because they know it's a start to go somewhere higher up in the company but, people don't progress unless they are popular and do a lot of socialising around. The idea of progressing someone because the person deserves it or worked hard for it doesn't exist in BCS, if the person doesn't socialise, they won't go anywhere.

Overall, a vey negative environment to work in, most people are unhappy there just waiting for the first opportunity to leave the department or to leave the company. I’ve seen so many people developing depression and anxiety on this role including me, people taking long sick leaves and eventually leaving the company a few weeks after they’re back to work because they just could not handle suck a toxic workplace. 

I do believe Bloomberg is a good company to work for, but BCS seemed to be a big messy negative call centre full of people feeling miserable and waiting for the first opportunity to find better horizons."

"261","Let me start by saying my time at Bloomberg did not start off as bad as it eventually got. Once you start off as a ""financial analytics"" representative they provide you with training which makes you feel like you're learning a lot about finance. In reality they are only teaching you how to use the Bloomberg terminal which is an outdated piece of software from the 80s with an offensive user interface. The name... ""financial analytics"" representative really stands for customer service representative. You work at the help desk. Your entire day is answering tons customer service ""tickets"" that come into the help desk. There is nothing analytical or financial about this  position. When a financial professional comes into the help desk Its your job to search the terminal (most of the time literally searching in the search bar) to find whatever number or news story they are looking for. All you do for 8/9 hours a day is answer help desk questions for clients who 90% of the time are rude and in a hurry for the answer because they value their time much more than yours. 

Here is where the ""toxic"" work culture comes from. Every morning that you log in you have a dashboard of your 10+ metrics which are constantly being compared to your coworkers. if your numbers are even percentage lower than your ""peer average"" prepare to be constantly reminded by your managers to get your customer satisfaction numbers up. Coworkers check each others dashboards to make sure their metrics are better to avoid being in the bottom 10%. Management takes that bottom 10% and will put them on a performance plan and even threaten to terminate their employment. Management uses manipulative tactics to make sure their employees are solving as many ""tickets"" as humanly possible, like you are a robot. 

I understand a job can be stressful, I understand that as an employee you are required to perform for the company. But I have never seen a company where people come in and leave with a constant feeling of anxiety that they need to out perform their peers and stretch themselves to a limit to hit metrics. This is not a sales, finance, or analytical job. This is a over the top and extremely stressful customer service job."
"262","If you want robots working at the help desk then invest in AI and have actual robots answer customer questions. Don't use manipulation to get employees to hit their metrics. Listen to your employees and learn why they may feel stressed and support them. They are more than numbers on a dash board and work tirelessly to answer all client questions. This job is not an easy one and it would help if you actually tried to... give support instead of staring at our metrics all day and jumping on us when you see a change. Do more and do better."

This limits a sales person's autonomy and personal development with things like deal and proposal construction.

* Whilst management maintains an 'informal' policy towards working remotely it is still seen... across the sales department as inflexible and something that should be asked for on an infrequent basis. Traditional in-office culture of first-in, last-out will probably live on until there is a change in senior management. This has been a top reason for attrition over many years as other companies embrace this.

* Sales people must be prepared to put in significant time and effort to learn the full suite of Bloomberg solutions (which is vast) in order to be successful in hitting targets. Gone are the days (thankfully) of silo'd sales groups within the company, where core terminal sales sold/serviced the terminal only. Enterprise selling is a welcome change.

* Bloomberg's product range is vast - both on and off terminal. The ability for the company to move nimbly and pragmatically in response to an industry challenge such as regulation (e.g. Mifid II) has proven to be difficult with so many product verticals and groups behind each not talking/working in tandem. Can lead to often frustrating and fragmented engagements with clients looking for holistic solutions. This has been acknowledged at a high level and continues to be a focus.

* Senior management are often not the most dynamic in terms of employee (in my case sales force) engagement. Would love to see more engaging, higher energy motivational sales meetings / wraps / town halls. Can often be down-beat and lacking positive energy."

For... example corporate actions team is well known for it notoriously huge amount of daily work such as resolving helpdesk tickets, clearing workitems from the queue in processing tool etc. Fundamental or Estimate teams will involve less helpdesk ticket resolving but more on value tagging (or correction of value tagging by vendors) from company financial or broker researches. Now for every new hire, they will be labelled as ""level 1"" for the first 2 years of tenure with the performance metrics focusing on daily operations productivity. After staying for 2 years you will progress into ""level 2"" with more metrics on projects you lead or initiate.

You should have a psychological preparation about the discrepancy between what has been advertised in job description and the actual daily operations. As a rule of thumb, please pay attention to the first few points listed in the job duty section in a job advertisement because usually they account for the majority of you daily tasks. In terms of ""interesting"" projects leveraging your data analysis and programming skills, well.. you can see them among the bottom of job duty section and so you should know what I mean. Of course if you satisfy with data entry and maintenance experience learnt from this position, I think it is a great job for you referring to my Pros above. However if you aim at sharpening your data analysis skills and developing programming expertise through some data science projects, think twice...

In fact, the mismatch of expectation explained above is one of the major reasons why there has been such a high turnover rate in this department, and even more devastating during 2018. Global Data did hire some strong candidates with sound Python/R expertise and data management background. But as the previous reviews said, due to numerous roadblocks including but not limited to: clumsy internal procedures to request access to database or even the installation of latest library; predefined preference (or limitation) of platform where you have to code/develop such as BQL/BQNT/DTP etc, such strong candidates are destined to leave soon out of frustration, disappointment and boredom.

Another group of attrition focuses on those who equipped with 3+ years of market knowledge and product specific experience. Internally we refer to ""Subject Matter Expert"" aka SME. Without these SME who excel at asset classes they cover to co-lead the data analysis, auto news generation or process efficiency projects, the quality of final deliverable could be hideous and sometimes is utterly a joke to our client's eyes. A news article citing the valuation of insurance sector health based on P/E ration could be published, unchecked, unchallenged by the analysts, due to the fact that if there is a SME ever he or she will correct your logic to use P/B since it is kind of a well known industry practice if you ask any client from equity research covering insurance sector!

Do not expect you team leader would have more market knowledge nor tech skills than you or any analyst to give you some useful advice, simply thanks to the unique management culture in Bloomberg. While Data emphasizes so much on engaging tech stack, very few, if not none, of the team leaders knows how to code in Python or other languages. Be prepared for yourself to be constantly asked by your team leader during bi-weekly catchup with one FAQ: Is there any project you want to do? I bet you a facepalm if you are conscious enough to ask this yourself: Isn't it supposed to be the TL who should possess in-depth product knowledge and insight to help initiate project ideas and assign to analysts according to their different skill sets, rather than ask analysts to contribute ideas simply because the TL has none?

If you read through the long article and arrive at here, I truly appreciate your effort invested in researching this company or global data. All things considered, if you do not mind of steep learning curve and value your learning opportunity and exposure to the true big data analysis and data science, go somewhere else because I am sure there are many great companies out there with a team full of supportive, competent and visionary seniors and managers who truly know what data science is. If you only look for a fresh graduate job with a beat-the-market starting salary, I wholeheartedly suggest you think about your exit strategy starting from as soon as your onboard date. We have long lost the job stability with a clear observation last year about the layoff of a bunch of news reporters and even managers who worked for more than 12-15 years, just before the 10Bln long term bonus payout in this March."
"324","Review of the whole 180 evaluation so that the performance of TL can be well overseen. Currently the 180 evaluation only goes to 1 level above, i.e. the office manager. It does not really help much to cope with favoritism, which in turn demotivating the SME to be promoted as TL and causing the a series of side effects I have showcased in Cons above.

Let alone the analysts, even those TLs are not clear about their... own career aspiration. As a matter of fact, once becoming a Data TL, his/her exit window will diminish drastically due to fact that TL is no longer in the production queue and so loses grasp of market latest development. Eventually TL seems to only have the choice of either staying for another 5-7 years as Data TL, or internally transferring to other departments which based on the previous cases, usually as Account Manager of the auxiliary products."
"325","There's a thick layer of inexperienced middle management despite fancy titles. Most have been there forever, and have limited or no corporate and professional experience outside of the company. As there are a lot of them, they are unable to grow or learn from each other, instead reinforcing a somewhat immature, weak and incompetent style of leadership. Interestingly, the upper management is much stronger and have... solid strategy.. no surprise that most of them are hired from outside the co."
"326","Mid-level and junior managers need a good relook"
"327","But there's a rule for everything at Bloomberg that's paralyzing and has highly competent, intelligent professionals constantly feeling the need to seek affirmation of a half dozen leaders/authorities before acting.  In my role,  for instance, I've got 4-5 people to manage but 5-6 bosses. It's a much different vibe than anywhere I've been.  Also say ""adios"" to your personal time. If you commute, expect a 12-14 hour... day. Bloomberg has finally evolved with the times a bit by allowing people to telecommute here and there, but each day is drudgery.  Instead of fixing a simply typo of a company name, for instance, the offender deals with a belabored, almost embarrassing process of having to re-run a story with the correction, deleting the old one off the system, then writing a letter to several managers to detail exactly what went wrong; so God forbid you spell it Proctor & Gamble instead of Procter & Gamble -- total rabbit hole that eats up tons of time and distracts. This is where Bloomberg takes its mantra of being candid to unproductive extremes and creates a sense of arrogance among the higher-ups that what Bloomberg does is above the level of its rivals. It's utter nonsense, as is the sense that employees can be rated based on cockeyed data points focused on production levels rather than quality of the work."
"328","Ditch all data sets behind employee rankings and eliminate the micromanagement that's crippling to experienced professionals. Reduce the workday to something more manageable instead of burning out your employees with sweatshop hours.  And if you're going to give away tons of the company's profit to charities, at least give each employee the option to designate their own organization. It's sort of demeaning to say... bonus purses are tight but then to gloat about the millions of dollars given to Mike's favorite causes."

Global Data department is one of the worst department to be in. 
The branding and job description is attractive, with all the buzz words like ""python"", ""big data"", and align with the focus on data-driven world nowadays. BUT, your day to day job literally revolves around mainly manually inputting data into the terminal, or making sure vendors doesn't input wrong... data into the terminal. 

They claim you get to learn ""data-skills"", but the reality is, even if you know python/SQL/R, you will get very limited channels to utilize & improve these hard skills.

Plus, they now pay people with python/SQL/R skills higher than those people who don't have these hard skills, and WORST OF ALL, there's NO career path for people who want to learn these hard skills to improve in their careers.

Global Data is seen as a cost-center in the company, and the whole department desperately needs to prove themselves to be worthy all the time. Thus, there is a huge emphasis on flashy quick ""wins"". 
It is not exaggerating that senior management puts emphasis on the quantity & list of wins the department can generate, rather than the quality of work (less errors in data)

An example of a win that demonstrate the  would be: helped out sales/news do their jobs. And whoever is able to pile up a huge list of these related wins will be evaluated favorably even if he/she doesn't do a good job maintaining the data quality. And those who does put in effort to make sure data quality is good will always be viewed as a liability because of the lack of wins

Also, politics (mainly nepotism)... within one year, literally, some of the best & top leaders all was gone (either left the company or department). And to replace those roles, the top management just put in their own friends instead of really looking for the right person to lead.

There's no career paths, and rumors around the company cutting costs seems to be proving true as they let a lot of long-term employees go without much explanations. Just a bad place to work"

"390","The thing that strikes me is that Bloomberg is a pretty good place to work, but could be so much better some real leadership, but never will. The simplified main issues come down to:

- No true leadership or management from the top down & zero culture of communication 
- Total disempowerment of employees and no willingness to take risks
- Now, now, now instead of stop and think for 2 minutes (or god forbid... using data and information to make decisions)
- Total lack of transparency on everything (mainly salary and career) despite claiming to be THE transparent company 

And the two things that make all of this worse 
1) the company generally thinks it does all of the above well, which makes it inauthentic because everyone knows it doesn't
2) nobody really cares that much to change any of it.

Leadership & Management
I have never seen such a successful a company so successful with such poor management, leadership and communication culture. Poor isn't really the right word really. It's more non-existent. 

You rarely hear from senior positions on the direction of various areas of the business, and if you do it's in a once or twice a year email. The generally held belief that I have heard stated numerous times is ""people will figure it out. Tell their manager and it will filter through"". 

There is a pervasive belief that the company is still a startup, so we will just email people and they will get the memo. But nobody really gets the memo and it creates mass confusion on what everyone is and/or should be doing. It's kind of like Where's Waldo (Where's Wally for the Brits), where you're trying to find Waldo, but looking around and wondering what the hell is going on in this picture only to realise it's mass chaos. 

They still do things from when the company first started in the 80s and beat the chest about it, even though most people look around and go, really? Maybe we should look at what is being done now? But as you will see below, there is zero desire to change anything as it works for the most senior of management (but nobody else). 

On the inauthentic piece above, this is actually the one area where they don't really claim to be great. It's sort of, yeah we aren't really good and don't really care about improving. 

Disempowerment & Taking Risks
The lack of empowerment with most people is daily and widespread, with few able to make their own decisions beyond what their favourite snack is (Amazed btw at how many pro comments are simply just 'the snacks are amazing). Doing things that will rock the boat? Never, despite the fact that is what the company needs. As stated, the worst part about this is how much the company promotes taking risks, trying new things, and not wanting the status quo, which is pretty much all anyone ever gets. 

Now, now, now 
So few people stop and take the time to do things that make sense. The company has been largely successful for many years, and there is a level of arrogance that Bloomberg is unassailable to disruption. Seeing companies like Reuters and others go through challenging times makes people even more bold in that position. I have truly never seen a company so bold in it's self-ego when customers are publicly stating they want to get rid of Bloomberg and form side companies to try and unseat the incumbent. 

You would think that would make people stop and look at trends, analyse the situation and then make decision. The Bloomberg Way is go out and do and the good times will roll. Except that they don't and things are vastly less successful than they could be. 

Lack of transparency 
Despite claiming to be the company that essentially invented transparency it is one of the least transparent places I have ever worked. On a purely salary and HR level, there is absolutely no understanding of how you are paid, what you need to do to improve that, etc. 

There are minimal opportunities to advance outside of being a 'Team Leader' which offers no real benefit because they have no culture of management so nobody knows how to do it properly. Again - let the people just figure it out, which would be fine if the company were 180 but it is 18,000. 

Case in point, the internal idea board where employees could share any idea about something, from I think we should have a family day to why don't they have a gym in the building, was removed last year because 'management communication practices and ticketing systems' were in place to flag issues. What that means is employees have no place to voice concerns or raise issues. HR is non-existent and ombudsman. 

Inauthenticity & Desire to Improve
This is the hardest piece to swallow as an employee. The company is simply inauthentic in its culture these days and is totally out of touch with the employee base.  Even things like how active Bloomberg is in diversity & inclusion, there are tons of elements where Bloomberg beats there own chest where they could be so much more ahead of the curve. 

Employees used to believe in what was being sold and no matter how manic things would get, they felt it and wanted to be a part of it. But the human element has gone and with all of things outlined above, people no longer feel it. People will stay of course as they have created the classic comfortable-enough pay structure, but they will never keep real talent there. I think another review said 'fake it till you make it' and that is 100% true. 

Amazingly, employees want a lot of the things listed above and there is simply zero desire to do so.  It all works for management and things keep going with the bottom line improving, but there will come a tipping point where it may not be tenable."
"391","Clean out the old guard and put anyone in charge that actively leads and that people want to follow. Don't just talk up things like taking risks and being transparent, actually back them up and be transparent with your people instead of treating them all like children. Empower people to make decisions like work hours, dress, etc and don't tell them every single thing that has to be done from when they enter to when... they leave. 

Look ahead instead of dwelling on Mike Bloomberg 'bringing transparency to financial markets' and let your people try and get ahead of the clear market challenges. Inspire change or people will burn out on your message and grow tired of its inauthenticity, especially when you aren't transparent about anything. 

I truly respect Michael Bloomberg as a world leader but he needs to put someone in charge that actually wants to actively run a business, be around, get to know the people that work for him (or here's a novel idea...her!). Instead we get the most inactive non-existant leadership that want to lead us into the future but have no clue how to get there, and most of us just hoping we aren't on the ship for that ride."
"392","Not the most interesting work for web devs. The company is primarily based on the Terminal (C++ stuff with a UI literally from 1985), although I don't work on that. Web is up and coming here though, but at the moment there's only a few rare sweet spots in the company that are playing with a modern web stack. If you're looking for bean bags and ping pong tables, you'll find none of that here. But you will find a nice... fat check, extremely smart people, and really nothing to complain about. Just apply. You'll thank me later."
"393","Continue the rigorous vetting process. The company and its engineers are well respected because of this. Create more of an open source presence at meetups and front end conferences. Also remember - you hire good people to get out of their way. This is mostly the case, but there's the occasional micro-manager."

"409","Now here are the cons:

First, take heed to many of the comments written about managers. Many managers currently in place have moved up the pipeline through connections or likability - not through grit or hard work. In addition,  your initial manager will define your success or failure before you step foot in the door so my advice, make sure to do some vetting before you accept an offer here. 

Second, while the... company is great at tackling challenges outside of the organization, there is a significant amount  of work to be done on diversity and inclusion front. Let me explain: If you are a cis White male, you will have countless opportunities at your disposal even if you lack the education, experience or credentials. Leadership within the organization is akin to a fraternity where you’re accepted based on whether you’re liked by management  and not by how hard you work. 

This moves me to my next point - women and minorities in leadership. Of the 19k+ employees worldwide, Black employees make up less than 3.8% of the workforce. Latino demographics are slightly higher perhaps by a base point or two. Asians account for roughly 7-8% I believe. 

While you will see minorities scattered throughout the organization, the reality that few of them achieve leadership success within the organization is certainly true. For women of color, especially Black women of color, the harsh reality is even fewer achieve leadership success despite many of them having stellar performance reviews and tenured experience.  

Retention for women and minorities is even more of a joke. Countless number of women and minorities are leaving the company because of the cis white male hegemony present within the organization."
"410","Do yourself a favor - proactively recruit and retain more women and people of color. Provide more opportunities to those who do not fit the majority mold yet who consistently provide quality work. 

Stop promoting solely on the basis of whether or not you like someone and focus on who can bring true value and impact to your organization."
"411","Poor management, unrealistic targets, non client focused, poor bonus structure"
"412","Unreasonable sales pressure at times."
"413","Resources are becoming severely stretched as the company grows. Micro managers need to be stamped out because not conducive to a vibrant and creative workforce.

It is really about your TL and/or their manager co-signing that allows you to leave.  When you apply... for a position on the terminal (which is the way you go about leaving the department), there are behind-the scenes conversations that go on surrounding if you should be allowed to go and/or progress.  Not a lot of diversity.  Most, if not all, TLs are white women in GCUS and the rest of tech-ops is very male dominated. To become a TL, there is a very precise mold that you have to fill to really be considered. Experience is not a factor - it really is about ensuring that management will like you and that you completely obey without challenging whatsoever.    Again, there is now a hybrid outlook as many departments have been merged.  If you are looking for a fast-track way to advance, this position is not for you.  If you are looking for a job that will allow you to pay bills, save a bit, and is a 9-5 type feel-- not too bad.  You will also be over-worked and it is difficult getting time-off especially around holidays as it is a 24-hour system.  You must be liked by management to really progress and move up -- and to get them to like you -- you must kiss up to them.  It is not really about skill level as there are TLs who became TLs because they were liked and not because of ability.  The company as a whole has a 'boys club' type feel.  For people of color, especially black women, this company is behind and not really big on putting black people in leadership positions.  A few latinos are in leadership roles but rarely blacks and very little black women.  A few black women have left because they were consistently overlooked and overworked - although they were in good standing.  When it comes to pay and pay raises - it is a very arbitrary system.  A lot of secrecy surrounding that -- your colleague can be in the same role as you making more or less and there is no particular quantitative reason behind that.  I worked at the company for over 3 years.  Happy I did, paid into my 401k and happy that I left.  Also, you are not really skill-building in the role as you are basically on the phone all day.  Some people are nice.  Some aren't.  I have made good friends that I will carry for years.  A lot of people are looking to get ahead so you have to be really careful what you say and who you confide in.  I've taken a few months since I voluntarily resigned before writing this review as I wanted it to be as fair and honest as possible.  Best of luck in your job search!"
"446","Work on allowing people to freely leave and transfer to other departments without so much red tape and behind-the-scenes tactics.  Really promote diversity meaning EVERYONE blacks, asians, latinos,  women- (black women), LGBTQ (which are already very much supported at this company)  and other marginalized groups. Also, be more transparent when it comes to pay raises especially when transferring from one position to... another (people work without knowing what their pay will be for x amount of months before being told their new salary).  People will always apply for roles because of the company name and the prestige attached.  However, high turnover will continue once people uncover the reality.  All the best."

"501","This is a review I found on glassdoor that i felt ENTIRELY represents the reality of BI, and so I felt it was more than appropriate to quote it here. I URGE you to read this in its entirety if you are thinking about joining BI:

""The owner of Bloomberg L.P. famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!” ….sadly there is a con job going on... within his business, right under his nose, within his Bloomberg Intelligence department (internally referred to as BI, externally by clients as BS) and he appears to be completely oblivious to it...

The Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) mission, sadly, seems to be destroying the hard earned reputation of Bloomberg L.P.’s owner and Analysts/Associates who work for the department through the combination of sheer management incompetence and deceitful practices.

How is BI Management accomplishing this mission?

Bloomberg Intelligence writes BITs (Bloomberg Industry Thoughts) or commonly referred to internally by everyone in the department as “SPAM”. Each BIT is about 2 tweets long (~500 characters)…these BITs are strung together to create the Wall Street's shallowest and most backward looking “research” product, the quality of which is multiples worst than Seeking Alpha and not even remotely comparable to traditional sell-side research.

Two primary products are produced: Primers (reworded investor presentations which are portrayed as insight) and ‘Best’ Ideas (any old semi-coherent, half-baked, or ill-formed notion). An Analyst’s research quality is judged solely based on their initial compensation level (not the actual research they produce) and pay bands are extremely wide ($125K to $800K per year for nearly identical roles). BI Management refers to this pay scheme as a meritocracy, but it is literally the diametric opposite. This logic ensures that where you begin in terms of compensation within BI is where you end -- irrespective of the quality of research produced. This practice ensures mediocre research is the norm and persists because there is zero incentive to produce high quality work.

The highest compensated Analysts in the department have Associates, recent college graduates who write BITs and work on their behalf. Given that the quality of the 'research' does not matter, this setup enables the highest paid analysts to do very little, if any, analytical work and effectively arbitrage of the wide pay differentials between Analysts and Associates (who earn less than $125K per year). Bloomberg L.P. is paying some Analysts $600K+ while they outsource the vast majority of the work to recent college graduates. BI Management refers to this practice as a ""perk"" of seniority, which decoded means that so long as you don't blow the whistle on them - they are happy to let some Analysts not earn their compensation. In fact, what BI Management is effectively doing is buying the silence of their most senior Analysts.

There is a quota for BITs that must be produced (20+ weekly), which primarily consist of Primers (20+ companies, 10 BITs minimum each, refreshed quarterly), Best Ideas (2 monthly, about 6 bits each), and other random pieces of information (the plug). This framework created by BI Management creates a never-ending treadmill of low value BITs/”research” that clients don’t find useful. This is evidenced by the lack of traction and engagement with clients despite having the best distribution system on Wall Street - the Bloomberg Terminal. Analysts are routinely encouraged to put in fake PROs notes (the internal system to track client engagement) to hide this fact - a simple review of what merits a PROs note for BI would uncover this. Just compare a Sales PROs note to one produced by BI to see first hand the level of deception.

BI’s key internal metric is “hits” (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through “clickbait” headlines and counting a BIT as a “hit” even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this “client engagement” -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly can’t get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BI’s management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan….this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for.

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BI’s profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting “picked off” by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Management’s primary business strategy is ‘putting lipstick on a pig’. Given the extremely low quality of the product BI’s management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned….and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme...

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloomberg’s Board of Directors to eventually axe BI’s entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!”...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false."""

"505","Cons are mainly for the role itself.
-  Hiring is not role specific for fresh/recent graduates to the entry level analyst position. Under the same umbrella of the global data department, the nature of work can be quite different for different teams. However, this assignment  was not made known to the new hires until their first day or even later.
- Most of the daily work is based on the Bloomberg terminal and some... internal softwares and highly repetitive, which makes the knowledge of knowing a lot of nuances and judgement of knowing what data is wrong/correct not transferable to the next job
- The role should be best described as ""Data operations analyst"" or ""Data management analyst"" ( not ""Global Data Analyst"" or ""Market Analyst"" as that does not reflect the nature of the responsibilities).  As such, I do not see a long-term fit of any of the above 3 types of people if they are ambitious in further developing their  (emphasis: transferable) skills through work experience.
- A lot of so-called projects are exact duplicates, but people in different regions just keep on working on their localized ""projects"" even if it has already been done elsewhere.
- Decisions are very US-centric, hard to get opinion heard from other regional offices."

"512","Everything at bloomberg is legacy. Code runs directly on hardware on machines in the datafarms. Some servers are IBM and solaris, not linux, and don’t even support the c++ compilers from 2011.

Most senior devs have been in the company since college and haven’t learned anything new about the world of coding for years. It is tough when your team lead is both a friendly person but also hasn’t heard of basic coding... tools, like `curl`.

I have friends who entered the company with me just a year or so ago out of college and spend most of their time writing fortran. (If you don’t know what fortran is, and you’re under 40, that’s probably a good thing.) Bloomberg Terminal frontend apps are written in an esoteric javascript framework called Rapid, which is a major headache and won’t help you build skills in any modern frontend framework.

Bloomberg is a good first job out of college in that you get a great pay and great benefits and can use that to establish yourself in a new city (probably nyc) and save up some money / pay off loans. But if you care about growing as a developer, and if you will be unhappy in an organization where people aren’t passionate and there are few opportunities to really learn, leave quickly."
"513","1) better communication across teams. I worked on a floor with pretty much all the teams that worked on the data platform and never ever talked to them. Requests in between teams went no where and blocked progress for days. Conway’s law comes to mind.
2) maybe just hire some smart consultants? Most of the senior devs who have stuck around at bloomberg are still there because they are not the more passionate,... non-complacent devs who have left. Senior devs with great architectural minds will go elsewhere. Get some short term, experienced & passionate developers who can stick around for enough time to introduce some new ideas / build strategies to improve bloombergs tech stack. 
3) get younger, passionate devs on the best teams. There are some cool teams at bloomberg. And there were a bunch of bright people in my new hire class. Yet almost everyone got thrown onto teams where they were/are maintaining huge monolithic systems probably written in the early 90s."

BI’s key internal metric is “hits” (research views, not research quality) and this metric is routinely gamed by BI Management. The primary means of gaming the metric are through “clickbait” headlines and counting a BIT as a “hit” even if a client spends literally only 2 seconds on it. In other words, if a client clicks on a headline and then immediately exits the BIT, BI considers this “client engagement” -- this is the vast majority of research views/hits. The combination of these business practices enables BI Management to show they are taking share on the Terminal by creating increasing amounts of spam largely at the expense of the legitimate news department and in the process make the Terminal less useful. Clients are so revolted by BI that they regularly ask Sales how to block BI's content.

In addition to BIT writing, Analysts are also expected to serve as pundits on TV, present at conferences, develop deep relationships with counterparts at covered companies, as well as speak to and visit with clients. Given the extreme low quality of the product produced by the BIT treadmill, companies and clients largely ignore BI because they do not consider the department a credible research provider. BI Analysts only speak at 4th Tier conferences...the ones who frankly can’t get anyone else. Truth be told, most clients think BI Analysts are reporters. BI’s management then represents to the Board of Directors that BI is comparable to Top Tier sell-side shops like JP Morgan….this notion is beyond laughable. Bloomberg Intelligence is provided free to terminal clients and clients are getting what they paid for. 

Analysts and Associates are leaving BI in droves even if it means taking a step backwards in their careers and accepting lower pay - this fact alone tells you all you need to know about the department. Turnover in the department is in excess of 25%. BI Management spins this number to the Board of Directors and HR by telling them falsehoods, namely that as BI’s profile increases Analyst and Associates are getting “picked off” by the Street. This is a straight up lie and highlights the character and integrity of BI Management. People are voting with their feet and the turnover rate is reflective of the complete lack of confidence BI management and the product they have created.

BI Management’s primary business strategy is ‘putting lipstick on a pig’. Given the extremely low quality of the product BI’s management have created, this approach is logical. Helping execute this strategy are Directors of Research and Team Leaders. Their aim is to strong arm subordinates into submission like the prison guards in the Stanford Prison Experiment. The qualities required to be a Director of Research or Team Leader are straightforward -- lack of research ability and empathy for the people they lead and most importantly a willingness to continue BI Managements organizational deceit without any questions. In short, these are people who lack a back-bone and enable Bloomberg LP to continue being conned….and for this, they are richly compensated by BI Management. Management is aware that Directors of Research and Team Leaders are unemployable outside of BI...and effectively pay them to perpetuate the scheme... 

It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Bloomberg can not solve the problems in its Intelligence department with the same level of thinking that created them. Most in the department expect Bloomberg’s Board of Directors to eventually axe BI’s entire management team if not the whole department when they figure out the reputational damage BI has caused.

The owner of Bloomberg L.P. and potential 2020 presidential candidate has proclaimed “I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one!”...So long as BI persists in its current form, sadly this statement should be viewed as false."

I quickly realized the free lunch and on-site doctor at BLP were more than great employee perks,... they were in place to prevent employees from taking time off from the workday. The philanthropic arm is a non-hierarchical structure; no one has titles. This sounds great in theory but in practice it cultivates a confusing promotion model where people throw each other under the bus in hopes of advancing their career.  Managers treated certain employees differently than others and rules weren’t applied equally. Lastly, there is zero technical training offered on any of their Bloomberg specific programs, yet there is an expectation where one is supposed to know them inside and out."

"660","- in London working hours are 8:00 am to 6:00 pm
-Bloomberg is the culture of no matter what you do is “never enough” the employee appraisal is based upon the following categories: Needs Improvement, meets expectations, Occasionally exceeds expectations, frequently exceeds expectations and significantly  exceeds expectations. Your salary increase will be tied up to your performance but to give you an example if you... are really good at your job and beat all your targets you will be meeting expectations because that’s the minimum you can do. Aside of your daily tasks  you will have to run projects like mentoring or creating training programs etc so unless you are running projects that are tremendously successful you will never get a higher rating (like exceeds expectations) 
- To be able to run those projects you need to work long hours 
- Bonuses are very low and base salaries you just don’t know, two people can be doing the exact same job with the same seniority and performance but one can be making 80K and the other 45K, everyone at Bloomberg has a price tag and it is not clear at all how they price you.
- Micromanagement is beyond absurd : you will have a public profile where everyone can see the time you come in and what time you go out, plus your calendar; every minute you are in the office needs to be accounted for and when you travel is even worse , if you have meetings you have to add  a note linked to the meeting in which you need to explain everything that happened, if you are in at the dr’s, lunch, private meeting etc etc needs to be in the calendar.

- The last successful year of sales for Bloomberg was 2012 since then the market has turned around, selling terminals and ancillary products is very difficult, clients are very demanding as the expectations for such an expensive product are really high so beating your sales targets will be really really difficult.

-After a couple of years at Bloomberg and when all the shiny bits have lost their appeal you will find it really hard to keep motivated, even if you give all to the job  you will be told all the time “is not enough” and then not getting financial rewards or recognition for what you do plus all the pressure and the micromanagement can be challenging at a professional and personal Level.                   

From what I saw, most of people after a while working there adopt  a coping mechanism which might come  in many forms, some people do exercise, meditation go to church, others eat in excess (the average bbg employee gains 10kgs the first year in the job), drink in excess, take depression pills or other pills you name it, at the end of the day is up to you to find a way to cope with the job, Bloomberg is the most un-compassionate  company that I know of when it comes to understand why employees suffer from Burnout syndrome and how to support them. 
- Flexible work arrangements are reserved for parents under special circumstances and you will get a pay cut because of it, You might get a work from home day now and then but managers don’t like people working from at all. 
- There are 2 types of employees at Bloomberg the ones that live and breathe the company’s culture, they wear the Bloomberg badge with pride and no matter what they will be there always doing their best for their company and the ones that are really miserable (not much  in between) my advise to you is to think about what is important for you in life before accepting a job at Bloomberg, if life work balance, family and mental health health are important to you then this might not be the right place.

To be successful on the data side you need to be as prolific as you can be, hand over your new ideas and initiatives as quick as possible to someone else and go on to the next thing.

And that's how he ended up being the president of Bloomberg's board. I'm sure there was a lot that happened in between but he didn't mention any of it. One very brave analyst actually asked him, ""are you... saying if you want to get ahead in Bloomberg you need to be in a social clubs with higher ups? ""He tried to row back from it but it was clear that that was what he meant. In his story he actually said he's daughter still reminds him today: ""Daddy, you owe me for that one"". I think Mr Grauer just didn't bargain on  a new analyst questioning him like that.  If you want to fix your organisation get rid  of guys like Peter Grauer, Josh Steiner would be a good one to give more prominence, but I heard he just left.

You may or may not end up with an idiot for a team leader, you may find yourself working on proprietary systems, completely isolated from industry standards, business practices and protocols, you might be working in a team with no social cohesion... whatsoever.

And things can change radically overnight.  The team whose company you do enjoy might need you to work on another project in another team or the boss with whom you have a good working relationship might suddenly move back to the US and a clueless, dogmatic, despotic, company-man appear in his place.

The hours are long and you will find plenty of colleagues, bereft of social lives, who will show you up by arriving early and leaving long after you go home.  Although you will be contractually obliged to work 9 hours per day, expect to consistently work at least 10, many work 12 hours or more.

You might work there for years and never have anything challenging or important to work on.  There is a company policy known as keeping-the-lights-on which translates to if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it meaning the rate of development progress can be slow as molasses.  This is especially frustrating and can be soul destroying for the creatively minded.

Technologically, Bloomberg is incapacitated by decisions made decades ago and its terror of losing market share is tangible.  This manifests as the front-end looking like something from the 1980s but, worse still, developers are forced to use company-specific versions of tools and programming languages, meaning they will not be able to keep up-to-date with modern versions and practices which is poison for career programmers.  It lacks effective testing frameworks and the majority of teams are required to develop, test and release everything themselves, at their own peril.  Some teams do have dedicated roles for QA and deployment but there's no company-wide policy.

Expect to be called regularly at weekends and unceremoniously at 2AM because the network undergoes maintenance every day and anything consuming tick data will set off alarms when it stops arriving.

Promotion to positions of authority is patently based on the Peter Principle and micromanagement and an absolutely obsessive focus on negativity are the norm.  It's well known that the Team Leaders and managers often form cabals so just one of them not liking you could spell game over for your position at the company.

2) other educational background - these people are hired because of their... language skills, which is one of the more important attributes for employees (need to read data points in every country); these people tend to stay the longest because they realise there aren't better-paying jobs elsewhere for their skillset. Other employers in The City are smart enough to know these people don't have transferrable skills from Bloomberg in finance

3) tech educational background - these types of people are increasingly being hired, and unfortunately are given tasks far below their technical capabilities. Suggestions for improvements fall on deaf ears and get muddled in politics. Innovation is led from NYC anyways.

I am single and don’t have a family so i cant imagine how difficult it is for working parents. There should be more flexible working options.

-Too many sales reps with the same target (i.e terminal rep can get credit for data reps sales) resulted in inefficient client meetings. Clients no longer get even surprised when they see 4 reps (specialist, core, enterprise real time, enterprise general rep...) for an half an hour meeting. Sometimes just the introductions take 15mins. This is because each rep/specialist is subject to heavily observed statistics such as number of meetings per month and also if a sales happen, they have more reason to claim their involvement. Purely a numbers game rather than actual contribution."

This does however not mean that they do not have... the passion to get great work done and achieve great results: working smart not hard. 

-Focus more on skill than nicely packaged favouritism. Your promotion should not depend on "" well this is how head of the US or EMEA department sees you"" but on the work you have done and the potential you have.  Also, stop monitoring every little step that every one takes: spending 10 min more in the pantry doesn't make someone less productive, it's not a sweat shop. 

-Get a lunch room for the people! This statement of ""we do not have lunch rooms so employees can help the local economy"" is a joke: a lot of Londoners save money by bringing their own lunch. They also interact with other colleagues during lunch time in the lunch room. IF you really want people to buy lunch every day then be realistic about it and increase the salaries by a good 15% and also, take a look around the lunch places closeby: they are all overcrowded with no place to sit. Well,unless  you go to the restaurants  in Bloomberg Arcade and pay for a £30 lunch every day. Not realistic!

Managers are often smart people who are very good at the work they are required to produce (i.e. analysis, reports), but do not have particularly good people skills. That is, they promote people not because they will run a team well, but because they are very good at their current role.

I continued to struggle to communicate with my manager throughout my time at the company and felt actively disliked, but with little power to change my situation.

"957","Poor leadership. At the managerial level of the Analytics and Sales departments there is just a lack of strong leaders. Many are first time leaders and their metrics are determined by others that have little to no experience.

At the higher levels of leadership there is also a large gap in communication. Typically bigger picture items work their way down the rumor mill to Regional managers to Sales Managers to... Team Leaders then to the Reps who are meeting with clients. This is pretty funny for a company that prides itself on being a ""Flat organization."" Seldom do the big picture ideas come to fruition, and even more seldom do they solve the problems facing the larger client base without costing them more for the service.

Internal Metrics are god awful. They barely make any sense, and to try and communicate them to the outside world is impossible. For sales reps there is no commission structure and your bonus comes out of a black box so its impossible to know what your year end will look like. 

I know I put this as a Pro as well, but let me explain: They discuss how this is a ""sales team"" but it is more of a consulting role where you are assisting clients with their issues and utilizing the terminal as the solution.  This is great because you will learn some priceless lessons about running a business; however, when you sell them something you will not receive the credit. Some deals can be in the 6 digit range, but you will not see a penny of it. Also, there are a number of different departments that scrap for credit, and if you don't document your every call, your every interaction , or if your manager just doesn't fight for you - you will get 0 credit. At the end of the year ,the number of successes determine your pay so these  conversations matter even though there is no dollar figure associated with each one. Long story short - you can end up working a lot on a small deal and receive the same credit you would for working barely at all on a large one. Its all about the story you tell which is ridiculous."
"958","Pay your employees more, especially in Sales & Analytics. It is a beautiful thing that you give over 80% of every dollar to Bloomberg Philanthropies, but the employees at Bloomberg Philanthropies are not the ones generating the revenue to help all  of those people.

Given the size of the sales force, how screwed up the metrics are, and the constant harping on Gross sales over Net Installs, there should be some... compensation for those that are having the tough to deal with conversations that fall by the waste-side. At this point we have captured the market, and are clinging onto the market share we have on people's desktops, so compensate the personnel that deal with needy clients that don't impact their metrics and retain client confidence. Pay the people who make the 1 & 2 terminal shops feel appreciated. Above everything else, recognize that you  are losing some of the best talent in the candidate pool every year because the structure in place is weak. Fix it."

Every job outside of engineering has... the customer service aspect. I didn't know data analyst meant customer service representative before I joined. 
If you have a degree, especially a technical degree, don't get fooled into coming because while they think they are a tech company, they are not. They dabble in automation and Python, but you still have the customer service part and data entry part.

My biggest frustration is that there is no long-term planning. Everyone just puts out the day-to-day fires. They enter the data and respond to customers requests, and a single request can shift your whole focus for that day. You do it all over again the next day.

Having the head of HR state ""it's okay if they quit, we can always find liberal arts students with 50k of student debt who need a job""  is indicative of the esteem that Support is held in.

"1043","Listen to your employees more"
"1044","Tedious work (most of the time we were calling clients to inform them about new functionalities on the terminal)

Strong emphasis on quantitative performance measures instead of qualitative measures

People working in Sales and Analytics were mostly people who actually wanted to work in finance, but were not able to score a job there. Therefore, there was a lack of passion and motivation. Most of the employees... did not enjoy their job.

Work does not require strong analytical skills (opposed to the title of the position) as it is mostly about answering questions about the terminal and subsequently about how good someone is to learn different functionalities by heart."
"1045","Make sure you employ people who are passionate about customer service and not passionate about finance, as the job is a customer service job. I also think the management should be more present and supportive of their employees, instead of constantly judging their performance by some figures. There is a lot of pressure and for customer service it is very hard to succeed if you get pressure from clients AND managers."
"1046","Nothing to complain about it."
"1047","can't think of any for bloomberg"
"1048","Its a bit of an echo chamber with few people listened to.  If you didn't grow your career at Bloomberg from the terminal side, your growth potential is severely limited.  Non-terminal employees feel and experience the tension.   This limits company's growth potential in an environment where the core business is contracting."
"1049","Cross-train non-terminal employees into the terminal business, at all levels, to gain fresh perspective and ideas.  Rotate some of the top terminal folks to other businesses to broaden their perspective."
"1050","Work is very monotonous. Will eventually be replaced by machines. Not all managers are well equipped to be managers. Lots of turnover, most people rarely stay on the same team more than 5 years. Hard to move up, very flat structure."
"1051","Instead of donating 85% of profits, donate a little less and bump up the bonus pool. Aside from the monotone work, the bonus is the biggest thing holding back Bloomberg from a true golden handcuff."
"1052","nothing to complain about really"
"1053","Need to understand skillset of top performers"
"1054","Lots of intense work is expected. Nobody has time for chit-chat. In editorial, the standard workday is 8-6 but really you're expected to work 12 hours a day in addition to nights/weekends if news demands it. That makes it a difficult environment for working parents, despite lip-service paid to work-life balance. Poor diversity, very few minorities in leadership positions. The New York HQ sucks -- crowded and loud."
"1055","If you want to retain more parents, offer more flexibility with work schedules. You can't offer editorial staff a shortened day but still expect them to produce the same amount of work as someone who works 12 hours. That kind of approach will always favor young single people and men with minimal parenting obligations."
"1056","-Training lacks compared to peers
-Limited salary growth"
"1057","Limited exit opportunities but good for sales"
"1058","1)Frequent management changes can be disheartening. Management tends to hire from other networks or promote managers from other media units ( ie radio, businessweek, etc).

"1059","Ethics matter (even in TV journalism). Spend time vetting outside hires."
"1060","10-hour days. If you have a family, you won’t be seeing them much. Very macho culture. They operate so fast they don’t give much room to think strategically. So you feel like you’re on a treadmill. Particularly difficult place for women, who are far outnumbered by men. They give you a great maternity leave but your manager judges you for taking it. Depending on the department you won’t see any women in authority,... which is extremely discouraging."
"1061","Beat the toxic culture out of there. Include women at all levels. It’s not Wall Street, so stop the spread of that culture."
"1062","Hay muy poco interés por reconocer los logros obtenidos por los equipos o individuos de la organización. Hay poco méritos y propósito para impulsar mayores logros."

* Befriend management... to increase your chances to be noticed (re. point above)
* On top of the already long hours, you will almost always end up putting a number of extra hours, which are not paid
* Consequently, your personal life ends up either seriously impacted or revolving around work

"1087","General CONS:

-From a long term business perspective Bloomberg has zero chance of growth; the market is saturated and begging for innovation, and customers usually do NOT like dealing or working with Bloomberg - most of the time they simply have no other option
-Employees are no longer valued assets, they are soldiers and rarely get recognition or praise from management.  You are expected to do your job, not... take risks, be quiet and make sure the ""Bloomberg cruise ship doesn't sink""
-The Bloomberg culture from the top down is hurting.  Not a company for people excited to grow a career, most employees who enjoy the salary and stability will fall in line and try to ""not get fired"".
-What you'll find here is the definition of people leaving or being unhappy because of the manager, not necessarily the company.  All of the pros listed above can prove worthless if you have a sub-par manager and within a negative environment.  
-The HR group within the company are robots and care little about employees below senior management.  There are DOZENS of stories about employees who have been wronged, treated unfairly and with disrespect - but HR's job is to make sure complaints are squashed and it doesn't make it up to Mike B.  Usually employee complaints are washed through the HR spin machine until the employee loses hope and either gives up, leaves or is shown the door.
-The working environment is very negative, but upper management is shielded from this or just doesn't want to know.  As of a month ago most employees either understand this and are accepting of it, or are extremely unhappy in their day to day.
-Bloomberg's first attempt at collaboration and enterprise technology has been a challenge, for both sales, product and engineering.  They don't get it.
-The sales organization overall does not understand enterprise sales, most managers would fail in a modern technology company.  
-It is a very flat company, there is no determined career path and most employees are all but convinced to be silent contributors.  You are all but told to not rock the boat.
-The culture is of extreme micro-management; all office entry/exit time-stamps are exposed internally, most managers expect you to take lunch less than 30 minutes and you usually have to be in at 8 and leave after 6.  
-Don't expect company sponsored events other than the summer picnic, most happy hours and events are looked down upon by managers.

CONS for Product Management and Engineering:

-Upper Management actually dissuades innovation, they think Bloomberg is fine the way it is, don't take risks
-If you care about customer (end user) experience, creative flexibility, and technology/tools developed after 2012 then Bloomberg is NOT for you.
-Most Product Managers are experts in the workflow of the user, not product or technology subject matter experts
-Engineering talent is respected and of high quality, but over the last few years the top talent are all being lost to more innovative tech companies:  Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Spotify, etc
- Several gaps and bugs pop up daily, and deploying or rolling out new features and functionality sometimes take weeks or months - not a great culture for innovative engineers - you'll want to go to one of the other big tech companies for that.  
-If you want to actually build interesting products, adapt to customer needs and create great user experiences, then look elsewhere
-There are more good product managers and engineers leaving rather than joining, a sign that the company and product is past it's prime 
-Bloomberg as a whole does not understand compliance technology, especially for non-Bloomberg data sets.  Customers are learning to look elsewhere.  

My overall message is to simply understand what you are getting yourself into by joining the company.  You'll make a good salary and meet some fun people, but if you care about advancing your career and being part of an innovative technology organization, then look elsewhere.  Some people are totally fine with the status quo and collecting paychecks.  But for those who care about careers and crave passion, if you look into their eyes you'll see souls dying.  

**Make sure you talk to current employees in the group you are joining before accepting**"
"1088","Actually try to innovate and treat your employees like trusted human beings.  There are some scary stories that HR is probably shielding from Upper Management.  Does anybody in mgmt actually care?

The company better be careful or they will continue down the path of losing 50% of it's customers in the next 5 years.  People at other popular tech companies think Bloomberg is a joke, take that seriously and actually... try to improve.  Appreciate your employees' ideas and creativity."

"1106","- There are a lot of office favorites. Some employees enjoy a lot more flexibility than others, regardless of performance.  Very inconsistent standards given on employee by employee basis 
- Office politics. Only suiting for a large company with a DC office
- No real career advancement. Once you take a job, you might have one more title that you can move to but thats about it. Mgmt positions don't open much and... when they do, they are given to favorites (not performance based). Several employees will leave BGov to move to a different part of BLP for advancement
- Very regimented. Management wants to push the idea of collaboration but it's only done to make you feel heard. No real execution from there or opportunity to learn from other departments on what makes a business go.
- Lack of drive. Large deals are to be had, but mgmt is more concerned about following the rules than getting more revenue. Lots of red tape

-No recognition if you spend more hours at work or if your productivity is high.
- Over-advertised ''Bloomberg culture''"
"1113","Stop playing political games on your employees shoulders in order for you to show power and authority.

"1114","Limited scope for career development, some teams are quite unstable with high turnover."

"1123","The company does not value or care about their employees.  The management and the human resources department are a total joke. They may seem like a nice and big company but they are not interested in your well-being and work/life balance whatsoever. One of the examples: There was (I bet they were & are still) a sexual harassment by one of the Bloomberg anchors which was reported several times to HR, but the HR told... and convinced the victim that the anchor has a wife and family so just to forgive him and do not tell people.  The victim was asked to delete all the phone call records from the nasty anchor and eventually left the company."
"1124","They don't deserve my advice, but I'm a nice person. PLEASE DO HIRE DECENT PEOPLE TO WORK WITH. HIRE DECENT HUMANS AS HRS IS THE FIRST THING TO START OFF."

2) careful with everything you write down in the chatting system and emails- they are watching. 3) let along they watch when exactly you enter and leave the office, how many minutes you have left your desk, and whenever whoever wherever of everything!"

"1131","Ambiguity of roles 
Chaotic collaboration with team and other teams"
"1132","* Out-dated propriety technology - though things have definitely been changing in the last few years and there is a very visible drive to improve this
* The downside to the amazing salary is that you can't leave... so if you get stuck working with crappy technologies and you don't have the power to change it can be a tough situation to deal with.
* If you end up on the wrong team, you can get stuck writing crappy... javascript monoliths for 5 years without learning anything and you'll essentially be un-hireable, even by other teams within the company.
* The free food is mostly carbohydrate-based junk - crisps, bars, candy.
* Massive delays in deploying software and services due to firewall and proxy and machine change requests that take weeks/months to be applied.
* Open office environment can destroy productivity if you like to get in ""the zone""."
"1133","Get rid of the legacy crap. Let's do this."
"1134","There are three roles you carry out in this department: answering clients' questions, calling clients with updates on the software, calling clients to discuss how their needs can be better covered with the Bloomberg terminal. The first role is what takes up most of your time and is what causes most stress, but the others only add to the generally accepted term of ""glorified call centre"", where we work 9+ hours a day... with only the breaks we allow ourselves, as the workload at no moment allows you time to breathe.
Your schedule is fixed to the minute and your work is broken down to micro-movements that are monitored with a great variety of statistical measurements, imposed by a management evermore worried to show that they are adding value in some way.
You do not rest and are not given time to carry out more value-adding activities during work hours, so do these after work, thus burning out after a few months. 
Your relationship with management can depend strongly on your performance in regards to your statistics, which do not reflect your efforts and passion to excel. And this can later have a negative impact on yearly salary increments."
"1135","Don't forget from where you come. The job is highly stressful and you were on it once, be more understanding and challenge your own managers. This is basic for the improvement of morale in the department, which has been low ever since I joined. And don't think that occasionally giving us doughnuts solves it all."
"1136","I can not think any cons"
"1137","Perpetual silly KPIs enforced such as minimum call % /query,  pestering for user occupation surveys, micromanagement from supervisors if you are lacking in 'stats'.

You'll be doing a lot of grunt work and repetitive question-answering; some department initiatives make you want to roll your... eyes.

Progression-wise, maybe if you want to do software account management/sales it's decent. Knowledge from studying on financial markets can't fully be applied/ learn things a bit on a superficial level. You might question why you are staying.

"1153","I guess that a few stories to represent the level of this company are better than a list of the cons:
- Week 4 of training, we are taught how to answer the phone/make a phone call following a script. Been called off as I was laughing during this ""lesson"" (note I was coming from Commodities Sales at Citi) and was obliged to make mock calls with the ""teacher"" until I got it ""right"" (bloomberg style right). 
-... Comments/sexual allusions that would be unacceptable even at a Uni party made towards women colleagues (I am a man, I worked on trading floors, I saw most of those stuffs in many places, but here it was literally ""oh we have this opening, you want it? Then why don't you show me your tits?"" - disgusting). 
- Micromanagement part 1: after working straight 7 to 11 (meaning I didn't even leave my chair to get a cup of water or going to the toilette), I decide to take a 10 mins break to pee, drink, and smoke a cigarette. When back I see chats coming from 5 different ""managers"" asking me where I was and why I wasn't taking questions flowing in from clients. 
- Micromanagement part 2: I come in the office with nausea, I end up vomiting in the toilette after 30 mins on the desk, disappearing for a good 20 mins. When back, I see I received the usual amounts of chats from people asking me why I wasn't working, I ignore them and go to the ""supervisor manager"" asking to leave as I just got sick. He asked me EXACTLY what I had and to give him more details. Well, I gave him all the details he wanted. 
- Snitching part 1: after months doing a particular process in the same way, I got called by manager who is livid and shouting at me as I didn't follow the correct process for that task. The next day I find out there were many people that knew about what I was doing (it was my 1st month there) and didn't say anything but were instead complaining about what I was doing... because of course in any normal company you spot an error and you don't help out, right? Absurd. 
- Snitching part 2: the infamous story of a guy who started with me, 35yo with wife and kids. He left his previous job as a store manager to start at Bloomberg, after 6 months he was fired. The funny thing being, his manager put him under ""performance plan"" after 5 months, which means you have 1 month to get better or you are out. He did become better. His manager calls him to get a meeting with HR on friday afternoon, telling him not to get worried, as everything will be fine and he passed his performance plan. What happened that friday? Fired. 
- Many stories, really many, of very stupid, not smart at all people getting promoted just because they were brown noses. Literally, as long as you say yes to managers ans swallow all their sheeets you'll have a great life, but then how can you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning? 
- Once we had a ""meeting"" to discuss a new product (a bloomberg function really, nothing more), we were asked to call clients (traders, equity) first thing in the morning at 8am. I suggested that maybe, just maybe, is not a great idea to call traders around market opening as 1. They won't listen to you, 2. They will shout at you, 3. If you keep doing that, they will finally hate Bloomberg, 4. Is simply a very stupid idea. Guess what? I've been called off by the manager and the guy doing this ridiculous presentation. 

I would love to call out names, those people really deserve the public shame. I'll limit to this, but please, if you really want a career in finance and you want to be recognized for your work, then don't work at Bloomberg. The job description they place online is one the best scam ever done on heart!"

The biggest flaw at the company is cronyism.  There are a number of people who have got into middle management positions, with no relevant experience or credentials, other than being the hiring manager's friend.  You can easily tell who they are, they don't actually do any work and delegate everything to their more capable team members, whilst ensuring that they take all the credit of course.  They end up being far more a hindrance than an asset to the company.   Whilst networking is an important and natural part of any job, the extent to which it counts at Bloomberg needs to be looked at.  It isn't a widely spread problem, but it is a problem.

"1248","(Your experience will GREATLY differ depending on what team you join. The following only applies to my particular experience in a particular team.)

Company-wide:
* Too many people are being hired without the required skillset. E.g. many new developers with no previous C++ experience are trained on C++ for 2 weeks then start writing production code. You can imagine the results.
* Legacy technology, legacy... infrastructure. This varies from team to team, but in general every technology used here is quite hold and a PITA to work with. Want to use a library from GitHub? Good luck - Bloomberg has its own potentially-incompatible C++ Standard Library implementation. Want to use C++14? Nope, ancient compilers are used to support obsolete architectures.

Team specific:
* Most of the work is not engaging/interesting and revolves around implementation of business logic with no real algorithmic/performance challenge at all. 
* You are encourage to make the the code ""as simple as possible for new hires"". No - hire people who know the language that's being used well, instead.
* Working from home is a perk of the company, but I find it very hard to do it without feeling like my manager is upset about it. I wish this was encouraged and easier to schedule as long as people are doing their job. When I'm writing a component I don't need to be in the office - just let me do my work and come to the office when it's beneficial to everyone."
"1249","More carefully select people and direct them to teams inside the company where their skillset is valuable. This is done for seniors, but not for new hires: I think this is a huge mistake which decreases the quality of software and makes people run away.

Encourage people to work remotely - some employees are more productive and happier that way."
"1250","Legacy technology and lot's of processes."
"1251","Management adopts a Micro-manament style that it's unsustainable"
"1252","Micro-management style should be avoided"
"1253","Again, I can only judge it in an engineer's points of views:
- Just so-so tech infrastructure among financial companies (not even counting some HFT firms). They use extremely out-of-date infrastructure that many had abandoned in early 2000. The key thing is: software engineering is NOT the money-maker; technical improvement is always secondary to ""keep things working as they are because clients need foobar before... next week"". In fact, even among financial companies, Bloomberg's tech infrastructure is no more than the average. You would be crying once you get into this company and learn what they're still trying to get on-board is something that mainstream has been using since 10 years ago. Seriously, take a look at what’s popular 10 years ago and you’ll know how slow and frightening that Bloomberg moves ahead.
- However, compared to regular tech companies (not even to mention the big names), Bloomberg's tech stack is something that engineers may feel shame to talk about at their class re-unions. In fact, this is the most critical thing for young engineers who'd like to keep sharp in tech. To put it in the simplest way: Bloomberg (at its best eng teams) offers great opportunities to make single-cylinder combustion engines. Other tech companies provide engineers with some engines (proprietary and/or open-source) and they end up making rockets and space shuttles. At its regular teams in financial divisions, the tech stack is just... It’s all about the business logic. NO TECH!
- No respect to former employees. Bloomberg never hires back former employees as loyalty is a key. So if you left, HR is not likely to take you serious anymore because they know you’re not coming back. This happened to many of my colleagues who left the company. They got poor or even no support from the company for tax, health, immigration and legal needs. Some of them got into troubles because of that. Just sad.
- Blame-based performance evaluation system (they'll tell you it's merit-based but nope). Not too many chances/incentives to outperform.
- Work/life balance at some teams can be disastrous.
- Any fault is recorded. Low tolerance to faults, especially in divisions that make money. 
- Pays much less than the top tech companies."
"1254","No advice."
"1255","Luck of the draw - Can be the most stressful job you will ever have. Hated  every minute of the Analytics department."
"1256","Bloomberg's best days as a high-growth tech firm are way behind it as clients continually look for ways to get rid of terminals; passive investing is getting more popular, eliminating the need for a high-priced terminal that often functions like a high-priced chat service; news department is beholden to big clients that quash stories; HR department is a joke -- constantly making mistakes; not friendly to women.... Never worked with a pregnant woman, probably because family is forbidden."
"1257","Keep doing what you're doing, regaling in the heady days of yesteryear with the old frat boy mindset and close-minded way of doing things. Really out of step with today's work force."

"1271","Management are inexperienced and unorganized."
"1272","Do better"
"1273","Let's be clear: nobody wants to work in the Analytics department, not even the people who work there. Either they are trying to use it as a stepping stone for another department or for another company all together. Moving into sales is not as easy as they make it sound, unless you speak German or French; otherwise forget about it. The turnover in the department is very high with about 1 or 2 people quitting on a... weekly basis. They are being celebrated like they've escaped prison. 

The micro management is extremely high, many other reviews have gone into this in a lot of detail. 

The more senior management doesn't care what's going on as long as the numbers turn out in their favour and they can pat themselves on the back. That people get depressions working there is insignificant as long as the statistics in Europe are better than in the US. After a few months of working there, you learn how to manipulate the numbers in your favour and then management tweaks them even more. 

If you show that you want something too much, you won't get it. They might promise you to move into a different department and then revert on that position last minute. You're supposed to get a pay rise when you become an ""advanced specialist"" but that doesn't always happen and the reasons are arbitrary or don't exist. 

Most of the management is in this department for the money. With their skill set, they would only get half their salary in the outside world, so they opted to become ""Bloombots"". 

Whoever wrote that job description should get a price. Greatest piece of fiction I have read in a long time."
"1274","They know and they don't care. No need to waste time here."
"1275","The company is ok, but data department is a dead end.. Most, if not all the TLs (Team leader, the lowest level of manager) are inexperienced and have 0 knowledge on how our client is actually using our data/functions. The department constantly brag and inflate the ""wins"" which make ppl feel good, but all the ""wins"" are either fake, or have no value. People, especially TLs, spend most of the time doing nothing but... micro managing. Don't expect any good leadership from TLs. The only type of ppl who got promoted to TLs are those who are good at corporate BS and can keep talking non-sense forever."

"1279","Sorrounded by a bunch of data analysts who want to be investment bankers yet take no interest in the actual market. 90% don't even have market experience but they will set the standards and rules for the company. Hours are 8-6 and no flexibility whatsoever"
"1280","Instead of showing impartiality all the time, show you value good work and top employees and they will stop leaving"
"1281","No cons as of now"
"1282","Annual salary inrease is predetermined by time served and it makes absolutely no difference if you are a slacker who contributed nothing or a star performer"
"1283","When you have a staff turnover approaching 50% annually because the ambitious top producers are compensated exactly the same as those who do nothing and contribute nothing, when managers are appointed purely on time served and not on their skills set, when you claim to have a flat collegial organization but in reality as based on the whims, likes and dislikes of management down to the team leader level,  when your... technology used to be world class and is now a has been and obsolete, you should realise you have a problem"
"1284","Quality vs Quantity? Management purely care about quantity and generating numbers in any kind of fraudulent way possible. Recently I've noticed a marked increase in this trend as they have ""clamped down"" on the senior or advance specialist teams. This means two things. Firstly, treating the more seasoned employees (the survivors) like children and bringing in inexperienced Team Leaders whose sole competence in life... is tracking KPIs and complaining when you won't help them cheat or fudge the numbers. The second point is you'll now spend more of your time pitching (cold calling and annoying Bloomberg clients) about new applications on the terminal, problem is they pick the most basic and pointless ones to make best use of your time here. I might add at this point the whole ""advanced specialist"" or senior analyst route is a shame with management pressuring new hires into these roles to grow this part of the department bringing people as a ""qualified"" senior in as short as six months after joining. Knowledge and experience however can't be generated in this period of time and consequently quality as been diluted, however quantity increases on paper so management are happy meeting their goals. Final note is turnover, our department is around 150-180 in London and at the moment we have on average one person resigning per week which is 29-35% turnover per year and extremely high. This is being dealt with at the moment by trying to hire more and more new hires (potentially you) to try and counter this. They are struggling to keep our headcount at these levels with more people than ever resigning, however surprisingly they are having difficulties  finding enough people to put through their meat grinder....maybe one day they will realize their issue"
"1285","Work on staff retention. Why are so many people resigning? Why are more senior people in the department desperate to move away from Analytics?"
"1286","long working hrs
i cant really think of any cons , it is allll good i love it"
"1287","The other side to my HONEST and COMPREHENSIVE opinion that you need to read! I separated it into 3 parts for your liking: 

Job Scope:
- it is not finance-related, yet the team leaders there have somehow brainwashed themselves (or are good at acting) that it is. It's not.
- people are right - you copy data from the news and paste it to the terminal. I was so sad that the this was the actual job and that people here... were right.
- think about it... Our clients analyze the data. If we were to analyze the data for them, we would be taking their jobs. What position does that leave us to do... Except copy and paste it and make sure that it's correct (by checking online or somewhere). Even the ""equity research roles"" can't give their opinions because it will be taking their clients jobs (sell side research analysts who use the terminal).
- there is also no data analytics involved - forget about using R or Python to visualize and analyze the data. Read the point above - What is there left to analyze?
- everything is a ""project"". Writing a manual on how the work flow to my daily work is a ""project"". The lack of... Intensity and analytical work makes everything a project.

Management:
- my team leader (TL) was a... pain. The  TL I had somehow lied to herself into believing that this job was awesome (FYI everyone on the floor hates this job but most don't leave due to the security and pay it offers - yes, moral is low and management knows this).
- they can't be trusted. It's funny how every TL sounds similar in their answers to their team. Make sure you ask questions - a lot of people would say they came from wealth management firms and that working in Bloomberg is better. Ask more --> most of them worked in the back end office of these companies. No wonder bloomberg is better - it's moreso the same job with better pay.
- they pride in having a university atmosphere. First hearing this I was happy and excited. If you think about it... It's not really. A bunch of adults acting like kids and the TLs being the frat that everyone needs to suck up to in order to become one of them in the future.
- sounds nice, doesn't it, to tell people that you make your career your own in Bloomberg? Think again. Management uses that as a reason and excuse to cover their own mistakes. ""Boss what should I do?"" -> ""Idk. This is your career to make here in Bloomberg"". Think about what a great excuse that is and how they could use it against anything... And they do!
- a personal rant - I told my TL I was leaving and didn't like this position and felt like I was lied to about the job scope. TL replied by saying ""you said you like finance in the interview? You said you managing data?"" Seriously?! if you think this is finance and managing data means copy and pasting numbers, then sorry i must be wrong about liking either! (Im in finance still btw lol).

Exit Opportunities: 
- this is the biggest point for me. I'd take hell if there were decent exit ops. There aren't. For those who think it only sucks in the first year - people who have stayed 5 years tell me it doesn't get better and you are stuck copy and pasting data. 
- look on LinkedIn and check the career paths of these people. No one stayed long if they eventually entered a somewhat prestigious finance or consulting role - all left within a year. The reasons to why were already listed.
- managers would say ""person x left to Mckinsey or Credit Suisse."" Ask again - they stayed for 6-8 months in my office before leaving, knowing they deserved better.
- my colleague made a good point (been there for several years and regrets not leaving earlier). Said ""people in the finance industry knows what we do... And they know that it isn't finance. We go to them to train them and sell our products and they go to our offices for training and meetings. They know very well that we just copy and paste data. It's sad."" So lying your job scope into the finance industry is not an option.
- the longer you stay, the worst it is. You will get pigeon holed as a data analyst. Forget trying to get a front end job. Many people left to prestigious financial firms - if you look closer, they are in the back end team. Also, if you want to do backend, I'm not against it - but at least do engineering work and not copy and paste data...
- in my office, no one internally transferred to another team from the global data department because no one wanted to take us in... Sad.


Conclusion: if you're driven or want a career thats not boring, dont come here. I felt bad for one of my colleagues. This was the persons first job and i asked if the person liked the job. Said ""idk. Are all jobs like this? (in a sad and lost tone) i answered the person by saying ""no. You can do better"". And thats my advice to you all. If you worked hard for a good career, you deserve better than what they offer."
"1288","Stop lying to the driven young fresh grads out there! It isn't finance and you're putting us in a difficult position because leaving early will look bad on our CV yet going there will teach us nothing and it is a waste of time."
"1289","office lociation of the US data team was horrendus. People who work in finance want to work in NYC (or some other big city), not in the middle of nowhere"
"1290","The moral and work environment in this department is at an all time low. For such a company that tries to promote transparency the whole time, this department does the complete opposite. 

Management does not look after existing employees and shows this every year with minimum pay increases, instead using the money to pay ludicrous wages for people they pull in from the street who end up writing garbage.... 

Management has turned what could be a great research department into a hamster wheel. The same nonsense is regurgitated on a regular basis and takes away from what could be insightful ideas generated. More and more people continue to leave the department and are fed up with how it is being run into the ground."

"1292","High pressure that comes with sales."
"1293","Stay focused."
"1294","Management needs to pursue new technologies."

"1296","Commmission is not a part of the compensation structure. Career advancement can depend on timing. Goals and Metrics are sometimes vague and challenging."
"1297","Goals and metrics can be more clearly defined. Incentive structure can be better aligned to accommodate collaboration. Management can play a larger role in advancing your career"
"1298","a bit more transparency in career progression would be welcomed."
"1299","HR are not so efficient"
"1300","Let me start by saying that if you think that this is a research department you will be horribly mistaken. This department reports into news and is nothing more than a glorified department of news. You will be lucky to find any form of analysis that you could use to form an investment decision and if you did use it as investment advice for your clients I would be very worried. This isn’t necessarily because of the... analysts it’s more to do with the direction and strategy from management. 

There are some very bright, intelligent and talented analysts and associates here and there also some very overpayed, lazy and unqualified senior analysts that have more or less won the lotto by getting paid the sums they do for putting out what they call research. These senior analysts and management are one of the reasons for poor morale in the department and why most people are looking to get out. In the majority of cases this is where washed out and incompetent senior analysts come to retire and die. 

The only worrying thing is why does management continue to spend the sums they do to hire such incompetent analysts that they believe are well known in the market place and will bring a reputable franchise with them when it always continues to prove otherwise. The downside to this for the rest of the employees is that when it comes to the end of the year, associates and company analysts end up with a 0-3% pay increase because management has wasted so much money elsewhere or only look after the select clique. 

The management structure also means that the people rating you and the people that you report to at the end of the year don’t actually work with you and have no way of properly understanding the work you have done or carried out during the year. This usually results in a farce of an end of year review, as its based purely on hearsay. In fact one of the senior analysts (one of the better senior analysts) recently left because he had no control over some of the other analysts who were below him in the same industry and left due to the poor quality of research. 

There are three way you will join this department: 
Senior Analyst: This is where you are expected to have 15+ years of experience covering your specific industry and are expected to be a well know figure in that space. In reality these are people with a very unknown or poor track record and in some cases haven’t even covered that industry before. On the plus side if you can secure a senior analyst role it’s like winning the lottery in terms of the amount of compensation that management will throw your way.

Company Analyst: This is where you will have had a couple of years on the street covering your industry and you come in as an experienced hire. In most cases this is where the smart employees are, but unfortunately are constantly shot down by the senior analysts and management. 

Associate: This is where you will come in as a junior. DO NOT DO THIS!!! It will be damaging to your career. You will know nothing about financial modeling, you will probably work for a senior who has no idea what they are doing and you will never get a job on Wall Street with the Bloomberg Intelligence name on your CV. This will pigeon hole you for life.

This could be a great department but given the Senior Analyst clique and managements strategy it just isn’t. It is a giant blackhole on Bloomberg’s finances with no ROI. If management scrutinized what was going on a bit more, there is a good chance the department would be shut down. Senior people in Bloomberg Intelligence are regularly lying and misleading the senior management in the company."

If you have any drive or self worth this not the place for you.  The petty politics and repression will crush you if you allow it. You will be exploited until you get fed up and just quit.

There seems to be a growing trend in Global Data - it... is a cost center and there needs to be cost reductions. The mantra seems to be, do more with less: alternate work-force, automation, data science, cut low performers. 

If you compare this department (Global Data) with say, Sales/Core Terminal, it's a different ball game. They are a revenue generating department and don't have to operate under a microscope.

Value and reward your employees better. It's one thing to start sending out... monthly accolades, but you ruin it when your actions in end-of-year reviews don't reflect all of these wonderful achievements.

The thankless -- and soulless -- writing (am I really paying... off J-school debt by bullet-pointing a press release in 5 minutes or less? Sighhhh.). The times you'll catch a coworker crying/going through a personal crisis/trying to converse/act like a normal human...but you don't say anything because that's The Bloomberg Way. Then there are the idiots and egomaniacs, oft one in the same. Sure tell sign you’ve encountered one…they act like they’re God’s gift to this fair earth and you find other people believe the hype – and one day, you sorta dabble in the hype before you have an epiphany…THIS IS BLOOMBERG AND NO ONE HERE IS A BFD!

----
Bloomberg Intelligence management is clueless, offensive, and could careless about morale. The second in command at the department was... inappropriate on many occasions. Absolutely terrible, unless you stroked his ego. Pay was terrible. Loads of mind games. Management lied about raises (e.g. ""you're getting a 5% raise"", but what really happened is they took the guaranteed bonus away and added half of it to your base, which actually decreased the total comp.). Some management asked straight up prohibited questions about medical histories, medications, etc.

One friend of mine (who also quit) was a foreigner and was more or less held hostage by Bloomberg's sponsoring of his/her employment visa. He/she was paid nearly 30,000 less than the associates that worked beneath him/her.

At one point, an email was sent around saying that we would have to work outside our normal 8-6 hours to get work done if we wanted to be considered ""satisfactory"". One higher up employee tried to fight against it, but was silenced.

Very very poor room for growth. As Bloomberg is news, research, sales, and software, the best shot at a higher paying position within the company is to transfer outside of your skill area. All the recruiters I spoke to said the same thing. Further, the BI product is getting taken into a very bad place.

Every potential employer I appealed to when trying to make my exit told me that Bloomberg was the reason I wasn't hired.

Expect to be criticized: your shoes, your pants, the type of shirt you wear, your hair style, and FORGET ABOUT IT if you're a woman. Management's treatment of women in the department was disgusting. When I was there, only 15% of the entire NY department were women. Management will decide they don't like you, and make up reasons for why your performance is poor to push you out.

My manager was a nearly 20 year veteran of the company, that had already previously been demoted. If you voice a concern, he would tell me why I'm wrong, rather than actually trying to listen. Voicing a concern or a workplace problem actually would subject you to discipline. Think thought police.

In the short time I worked at Bloomberg Intelligence, no fewer than 25 people quit in the New York office, and there were only 75 to begin with. Management told me this was ""normal"".

Management tried to control associates from hanging out together and from talking to one another. I was used to asking coworkers ""hey, how was your weekend"" on Monday mornings, but was told this was inappropriate. I actually got spoken to by senior management who told me that discussing our personal lives was prohibited. Meanwhile, managers sent around birth announcements weekly.

Me and several former coworkers would literally cry to one another about the abuse and plain lack of care or concern for us that took place.

If you like low self-esteem, getting paid half of what your worth, and working over time just to quality as ""satisfactory"", then by all means take this job.

I was plainly told that management doesn't care if you're happy at the job. It's not their problem."
"1454","The head of the department is awesome. He cares about the group’s mission. But he's too far removed to make any real difference in employees happiness. He should hire some senior people that aren't solely looking for paid retirement and actually care about creating a good product, which is exactly the opposite of what the analyst TL’s currently do"

"1467","This really is a nasty, nasty place.  Dull, tedious workload, unnecessarily long hours with absolutely no give and all take, inward-facing approach with no regard for customers whatsoever, micromanaging middle management whose only specialist skills are brown-nosing.   Think Lord of the Flies - a kid in charge of the other kids and not a colouring in book in sight.  The company prides itself on growing organically,... so it never gets any fresh ideas in, and subsequent generations of middle managers just follow the status quo.  Oh, and factor in the several sizes of new trousers you'll need to buy as you get fatter and fatter from misery-eating."
"1468","1.  Treat the workforce like adults rather than children.  2.  Drop the arrogant ""you need us more than we need you"" approach (what other company out there makes it its policy to never re-hire a leaver?).  3.  Have a think about why your staff turnover is so high - and don't blame it on ""the unique culture"" which is Bloomberg-speak for its tortuous working conditions.  4.

"1475","Not a good place if you are a tech person. This is a place that argument wins code. Good interpersonal skills are much more important than your code quality.
As a developer, you will feel you are always the second-tier in the company and you have little control over the product but have to follow the business and sales.
Few of the upper management has a tech background so that they do not know much about how to... improve the efficient of the developers by improving the overall software infrastructure. Most of the developers works hard and they are generally smart but the overall productivity is quite low. One example is that we do reinvent the wheel a lot. One example is that for almost every teams that use Python they write their own python util module. Let's say their are 100 teams that use python and there could be 100 different version of parseTimeInput method in their own git repo. I have no idea why the whole company do not maintain only one general python lib that all team can use. 

In this place it is very hard to get rewarded or promoted by just doing a great job in coding. Communication and other inter-personal skills weight more than the tech skills. That is why there are more upper level managers have business and non-tech background in the development departments."

There’s a constant lack of headcount given the tremendous and demanding amount of work leading to tons of last minute scrambling and urgent requests. 
Creatives and project managers are spread very thin and are always burnt out. Upper management... continually preaches about wanting everyone to ""work more efficiently"" without actually hiring more people or cutting down demand from clients. 
No career growth 
With a very low budget- work functions are rare (no holiday party) and you usually have to buy your own drinks. 
With high turnover and constant restructuring and layoffs, there’s always an atmosphere of instability and low morale"

"1483","Often cited as the biggest turn-off for would-be applicants, the hiring process requires patience and persistence. 

Choosing this path can be tough if you are the kind of person who needs to see immediate results in order to be fulfilled. Real, lasting results are sometimes slow in the making. The process of getting things done takes patience, perseverance and a positive attitude."
"1484","- I believe the unusual combination of Bloomberg's private ownership and dominant market position have created a culture of nepotism, inefficiency and general poor management that persists across the firm but particularly in Analytics.

- The nature of running a 24/7 Helpdesk means you do not have control over basic aspects of your working life (what time you have lunch, leaving work early, taking time off)

-... The core terminal business is currently in decline and business is tough. This doesn't make for a happy salesforce or happy clients. Management have persisted with high sales targets that, when not hit, cause pay to stagnant and bonuses to be cut.

- What is not made clear at interview is that you now spend 2-3 years on the Helpdesk before moving to sales/other areas. Even when people are ready to move on their careers are held back.

- Too many people get enticed to work at Bloomberg on the snacks in the pantry and cool office design- don't! The novelty wears off after a month. Base your decision on more substantial factors.

- Do not think you can use this role as a stepping-stone into a front office finance role. People generally go to the middle/back office or FinTech startups."
"1485","- Hire the odd manager from outside the company to mix things up and provide some external perspective. Too many Team Leaders have come through the company right from Customer Support Reps and owe their ongoing success to subserviency and unquestioning obedience.

- Stop moving the goalposts of success one week to the next- spend time deciding long-term goals and persevere with them.

- It is not fair to promise... employees one path of career progression when they join then change this numerous times after they have joined the company without explaining the rationale behind this and acknowledging the inconvenience this may have caused.

- Make more effort in discovering employees' abilities in areas outside of answering client's queries and utilise these to your advantage instead of seeing them as a threat!"
"1486","High stress environment.  (I experienced this first hand, but also heard it from several employees in various other groups.)  Company culture was opposed to using products developed outside the company (in the name of not being dependent on external suppliers).  This led to employees having to use buggy internally-developed systems for mail, chat, calendar, bug tracking, room reservations, etc.  Hard work and talent... were not rewarded or appreciated.  Out-of-touch management didn't know enough about industry standard software development practices to improve morale and efficiency.  Poor leadership rewarded employees for undermining peers.  Knowledge hoarding among employees for job protection was common.  While the company overtly promised training opportunities for employees, employees were often discouraged from getting training and frequently had to cancel it due to excessive work loads.  Some long-term employees, while having plenty of experience with operating internal legacy systems, had no software engineering experience, yet directly managed software engineers.  Industry standard software development practices were lacking: no automated build system (developers hand-built code deployed to production servers), no automated testing, highly manual software deployment and configuration management, no integration between revision control and software release systems, no integration between code review and software release systems.  Code base has large technical debt due to poor oversight and no leadership eye toward maintainability and code quality.  Employees in a ""senior software developer"" role spent less than 10% of time on development, most of time on dealing with manual software deployment and frequent operational emergencies due to software breaking."

"1516","- Very pushy culture and micro managing, managers are so busy they read all your chat to see if you mention their name, then pretend they haven't read it and get their petty revenge.
- Excellence is not rewarded, they don't want you to have great knowledge, they just want you to be easily replaceable, therefore statistics and kpi are geared toward quantity, not quality.
- Middle management is some of the worst I... have seen, they just promote the Bloomberg robots, the over achievers that know well enough they couldn't even get a job as a cashier at Tesco, wondering why they got in in the first place. Therefore the way they manage is just to pretend they're always busy and would shot down anyone with constructive feedback.
- Big Brother, you are consistently monitored, camera above you hear, they always know what floor you are badged in, it shows on your internal profile pic, chats at being monitored. Everybody is paranoid, you know things are messed up when the managed always make sure the mute button is on in meeting room, like they know it's being monitored as well.
- Evaluation are completely useless, they basically rank you 4 months before the EOY, anything you do in between is completely useless, they will just make up the rating on the way.
- It's a big corporation that pretends it is still a startup, therefore the way things are done is completely messed up.
- They never consult people when they come up with new process, decisions are made by people who haven't talked to clients for years, they will just say, hey we are trying this new procedure, let us know your feedback, it doesn't matter if feedback is horrible, they will still go ahead and implement it.
- Managers will always try to come up with new ideas so they can boast about it in their EOY evaluation, so expect to get a lot of nonsense projects before evaluation period.
- Political correctness is insane, you get spammed with emails about  LGBT community and women in finance event, even though more than half of middle management is filled with them. If you are in one of these groups you are basically not going to get fired. I remember a girl who was the worst employee I saw in my career, she managed to get away for more than a year, while a guy who was ten times better got the sack after a couple months. 
- They don't care about their employees, all they want is you to work hard, don't work smart please, just do numbers with the minimum quality. Even the chairman said he would rather have dumb people who work hard than smart people, if you want a coffee break go work for Google, like wtf...
- They will never say you did a good job, they will always point at stuff you did wrong six months ago and remind you every time you do something good, yeah but last time you sent an email and made a typo, duh.
- They never fire people, this is the biggest BS I've seen, they don't do it so they don't get sued, instead what they do is harass you to the point where you quit, I've seen so many people leave but knew very well management were after them.
- Stingy, they will try to squizz as much out of you as they can, then give you the lowest raise they can get away with. The rule is to ask you to do 15 things, knowing well enough you only have time to do ten, so when comes time to evaluate you they have the ammo to bash you. 
- Creativity is banned, if you come up with new ideas they will just keep on ignoring it, and just take what makes management look good.
- Company is screwed, they won't be able to maintain the same sales growth, they don't listen to clients and just come up with gimmick and shinny product that don't really answer the client needs, expect some restructuring in the coming years."

It's unbelievable the lack of client knowledge in middle management, I went with some high up people in the company for client visit and they were absolutely clueless, they think they can talk to them like they talk to their reps. Also stop with that ""once you are out you can never come back"", this... just show how immature the company is, some of the best performers in other companies are people who left and come back. Stop managing people like in the 80s in New York, this company is now global and should understand the cultural difference. There are many smart people in this company that are treated like complete garbage, if only you had enough vision you recognize who they are the company would be so much more successful."

"1593","*This review only reflects ADSK (sales and analytics) I did not have much exposure to other Non-Core terminal departments. I would give 4 starts as a company but 1 star for the department.

I joined Bloomberg after my graduate degree thinking/hoping I will be an analyst. However after I worked for nearly two years I can tell you that it is not an ""analytics"" 

-Most of us were hired to move to sales quickly and... very focused on all interviews. BUT in reality, not many people move to sales as there is no demand. People usually wait 2 years or more to join and mean time stuck taking""tickets"" 

-Long hours of doing the same thing. As mentioned, there are not much to analyze on a daily basis. All you doing is just looking up for functions or fixing excel sheet. Everything is monitored and made us feel bad taking a break or going to a bathroom. Those ""Stats"" are everything as most of the ""team leaders"" luck with management skills so that your performance is depend on that stats. If you help others it will not be good for your stats so team work is not great. Especially people with no real skills tend to focus on stats as they wont be able to do much else to show.

-""Training"" they provide is NOT a financial education. It is only for use of the terminal. You become ""specialists"" but most of them does not know basic knowledge of finance. I.e. first week of training they will explain what is bond and stock...(yes they actually did) then after few weeks of training you become ""specialist"". 

-Your future depends on the team you are assigned to. In this department, it is all about being liked by the management and have a good stats. NOT knowing real finance at all. If you get stuck with not good team or manager it is very challenging to move anywhere. 

-No transferable skills. The job is all about the terminal. This is one of the biggest issue. You will get stuck with this department. I have seen so many ""analyst"" (without any financial background) trying to find a job after couple of years but cannot get any. Knowing how to use the terminal is a good skill but without actual financial knowledge no one will hire you. Then this is the part that gets worse. Those people without skills cannot move to sales or find a new job so they stick around and become Team Leader without any people or management skills. 

-Very fast turnover. People who can leave do leave very fast. others stuck with ADSK will left doing the same job over and over. TL will put a lot of pressure on you to keep up the stats even though people are leaving because of them. The reason is very simple, their pay is based on the stats as well and their stats is basically our stats. So they want big bonus so they will use you as much as possible to achieve what they want. 

I would NOT recommend anyone for this potion to be honest. Yes, Bloomberg is a good name but when you look for a new job name will not get you a job but your ability. So little you can learn from this department and unreasonable amount of unnecessary stress it is very poor work experience. If you are thinking about joining, you should think well. If you have to take it then leave fast. Your market value will decrease rapidly."

data... management only involves the specific tools used at bloomberg and so you dont develop any transferable skills outside bloomberg. This is what we do every day: set up Bloomberg´s data tools to automatically collect data on a regular basis. Again and again and again and again. Oh, and create tickers for this points. The most exciting thing you might do after a year or so doing this horrendous job, could be to become responsible for maintaining specific data or data management tasks or admin or vendors.

I´ve spoken with lots of colleagues and lots of people feel mislead by the company and/or strongly dislike their day to day. There is a general lack of interest in most people who have stayed here for years and then got comfortable 

2) hours are 8am to 6pm - as written in contract and you´re allowed to work from home if you´re ill or if the plumber is coming to your house. 

3) You get treated like a child -actually i might have had more space to do think and do for myself when I was 5.  This goes not only for global data but for the entire company. you get told what to do, how to do it and when to do it. No space to do things differently or to do different things.

data... management only involves the specific tools used at bloomberg and so you dont develop any transferable skills outside bloomberg. This is what we do every day: set up Bloomberg´s data tools to automatically collect data on a regular basis. Again and again and again and again. Oh, and create tickers for this points. The most exciting thing you might do after a year or so doing this horrendous job, could be to become responsible for maintaining specific data or data management tasks or admin or vendors.

I´ve spoken with lots of colleagues and lots of people feel mislead by the company and/or strongly dislike their day to day. There is a general lack of interest in most people who have stayed here for years and then got comfortable 

2) hours are 8am to 6pm - as written in contract and you´re allowed to work from home if you´re ill or if the plumber is coming to your house. 

3) You get treated like a child -actually i might have had more space to do think and do for myself when I was 5.  This goes not only for global data but for the entire company. you get told what to do, how to do it and when to do it. No space to do things differently or to do different things.

Michael Bloomberg has built a successful company based on TOTAL CONTROL of his customers and his employees. 

Big banks pay a fortune for it's products and Bloomberg controls the market so competition is limited.

Employees swipe in and out when they enter/leave the office... allowing management to see exactly where you are.

Management does also have access to people's diaries, and keep track on the number of phone calls and meetings that are made.

"1657","Difficult work environment in which there was a lot of in-fighting among mid-level managers."
"1658","Employ stronger leaders and listen to employee feedback."
"1659","1. Unless you are so passionate about the financial technology space and revolve your entire career before retirement around it, sure, start at Bloomberg, but know that the only common exit options are Reuters, Dow Jones, Wind, FactSet. Yes, you're not even good enough for ratings agencies like S&P and Moody's.
2. People of the middle management a) treat you like a kid who does not know how to do ""business"", b)... look down on you as an intellectual individual, and c) personally harass you. 

a) Usually, people in the middle management are those who only worked for Bloomberg, and they claim themselves to be experts on business management and development in front of freshly hired young smart kids, some of whom even interned and worked for companies like McKinsey, BCG, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, etc. This is kind of like comparing between a Mechanical Engineering professor and an undergrad who majored in accounting on the matter of whom to trust for keeping your books updated. Just because you're older does not mean you're more qualified and brighter.

b) Most of the people in the middle management grew with the company when Bloomberg was clearly the second place in the market compared to Reuters, and these people in the standards of today, are not quite academically and professionally qualified, but loyal as a dog to the company because they themselves know they are not qualified to go anywhere else in the world (maybe, except for customer service roles at a department store or at best, Nike). Yet, they look down on you as kids who need to ""learn more"" because you supposedly lack the ""knowledge"" when you graduated from top-tier universities, interned or worked full-time for intellectually demanding companies. If you are a member of the current generation looking for jobs, just because Bloomberg is now big does not mean it is befitting for your intellectual and professional capacities.

c) I had a boss who would call me consistently because I am late from coming back from an 1-hour lunch by two minutes for fulfilling my basic biological duties as a human being (yes, to urinate.) If they would harass you for that, imagine what kind of treatment you would get for other issues and events.
3. There is no upward mobility or a better future that young employees could look forward to. Again, because people in the middle management grew with the company and have nowhere else to go, they usually stay at the company for at least 6-7 years, up to 20 years. There are so few leadership roles that entail creativity, proper responsibility, and excitement, and they are already hogged by unqualified members of Bloomberg's past glories. I know of so many seniors who at first had so much faith in the company, stayed, and are now regretting it not because they are unqualified, but just because there are no opportunities and rooms for growth due to Mr. Mike Bloomberg's paranoid obsession with dogmatic loyalty.
4. Do not fall for what Bloomberg claims to be a ""lucrative"" compensation package. Taking into consideration your qualifications, you are heavily underpaid. You are only paid more than the local human talent pool who virtually paid little to no tuition for cheap local university and who work for local firms in the city. The bonus scheme is also practically inexistent because as a private company, Mr. Mike Bloomberg just loves stuffing his own stomach.
5. One major selling point to job seekers is that Bloomberg offers all these wonderful training sessions. Do not be fooled. The training is glamorously titled under luxurious financial terms, but in truth, you are brainwashed with knowing how to use your fingers to give repetitive answers. Essentially, you are being taught how to teach your 90 year old grandmother on using Microsoft Office or the e-mail.
6. Overall, there exists an unfixable culture of hypocrisy. On the surface, they would market themselves as an innovative technology firm that encourages taking initiatives and creativity, but once you do take initiatives and try to demonstrate your creativity so passionately, they flunk you down with the stubborn adult-look, as if ""you young kids just don't know how to do things."" Simply put, the company is liberal and free on the outside, but conservative and jail-like in the inside. If you consider yourself to be a straightforward, no-BS, honest, and honorable man/woman, Bloomberg is not the place to be. Have some love for yourself, fellow millennials!"
"1660","Based on my experiences with the horrendous culture and inner workings of your company, I am confident that you're not going to listen anyways, so I won't bother wasting Glassdoor's memory and data space to give advice to the pitiful management of a depressing company that is Bloomberg L.P."
"1661","Vastly different work experience depending on the silo you are in.  Working on terminal side versus, say data, is different in the way you are paid, treated and respected.  ""Bloomberg values""?  What Bloomberg values?"
"1662","Lose the ""this is Bloomberg"" so we can do anything to anyone mind set.  Multiple layers of management and approvals to do even simple things are silly.  Again, depends on what group/business unit you are in.  Some simpler than others."
"1663","I'll start from the beginning.... - The 'Financial Product Sales & Analytics' job title is a sham. It's quite literally customer service/support for Bloomberg terminal users - where basically you're the guy on the other end of the HELP HELP button on the terminal, that's it, definitely not as 'sexy' as the title tries to make it out to be. - They will dress up the position as a 'great way into the company, and an... opportunity to learn about the product and industry' and promise that it is simply temporary before rotating into the Sales department (which is basically the same job but with less micro management and you get to travel). This is a lie. Your rotation into Sales is wholly based on what the business needs and your language skills. If you're a Spanish/French/non-language speaker, doesn't matter how good you are, you're staying in 'Analytics' (customer service) for the long-haul (at the very least 1.5 - 2 years if not longer). The only 'regional team' that sees semi-regular rotation into Sales are the Germans - If you've worked customer service before, you'll know what this job is like. Similar to a call centre but the problems customers come to you with are usually a lot more complex and require brains to work out. Add to this the fact you need to at any one time be dealing with between 2-4 customers, it produces a perfect cocktail of angst, anxiety and unnecessary stress, compounded by the sheer ineptitude of the management in the department who strut the floor like headless chickens (i will dedicate more words to this later on). - Your performance is completely and solely quantified into numbers. EVERYTHING is driven by 'metrics' i.e. how many customers you called on the phone, how long you took to answer a 'ticket', how much of the working day you spent taking tickets, etc. etc. the list is endless. They set these standards that someone has simply imagined over-night as the true gauge for good quality service, and if you don't 'keep-up' these standards, boy o boy you're in trouble. On top of that you get QC'd (quality control) where if you make a simple mistake, this will count negatively on your performance with no way to amend - all this combined leads to an obsession around 'getting your stats up'... needless to say this gets boring very quickly and causes completely unnecessary frustration, where even if you are actually doing a great job, it can look like you are absolutely dreadful. - MICRO MANAGEMENT GALORE... the analytics department is THE true embodiment of the phrase 'micro management'. As detailed above, absolutely everything you do gets filtered down into numbers, and management is obsessed with imposing their standards to the point that you'll often get shivers from the smelly warm breath of having them on your back. - Bureaucracy is a big part of the day to day in the analytics department. If you've got any kind of opinion, you better keep your mouth shut, as anything you say that might challenge the status quo simply counts against you - to the point where they will even try to push you out of the company. They don't value creativity or individuality at all - this means you'll often find yourself surrounded by drones resembling human beings which have been aptly named 'Bloombots'. These folk are the ones willing to jump over whatever hoops necessary to 'stand out', no matter how ludicrous, and have stapled a fake peroxide smile to their face. - You are FUNGIBLE, no really, you are. At least according to the global head of the department who mistakenly (or maybe intentionally) sent an email to everyone titled ""Analytics - Building a Flexible, Fungible Workforce'. Don't worry though, if you don't have a spine and are happy to keep your mouth shut for the rest of your life then you'll find great job security here! - The Management... well from what you've read so far you can see that the people who end up staying at the company are doing it either out of necessity (money, family, etc.), or purely complacency with a 'comfortable' job. This really doesn't leave much and they are completely power drunk, often imposing their authority at the expense of others. - ATTRITION, yes you guessed it, the Analytics department sees vast amounts of people leaving within the first year of employment, myself included, for better or simply more rewarding roles. E.g. out of my 'starting class' of around 26 people, only 6 were still in analytics once a year had gone past...and I can assure you that none those 6 remainders want to be there. But this is how their operating model is built. They want to filter through the 'Bloombots' and filter out anyone who doesn't wish to conform, with a small group nestled somewhere in the middle who have navigated the field to relative comfort."
"1664","Suggestions for Management The Analytics department - Just stop what you are doing. Go back to the drawing board and start again. Your model isn't sustainable and is costing you far more in money terms with attrition and talent leaving the company than you get from the value of what ends up staying behind. Also, probably a good idea to not tell your staff that they are 'fungible' (replaceable).

The company - This... is a financial technology company where 85% of profits are reliant on the state-of-affairs in the finance industry - the same industry which is seeing unprecedented levels of regulation and uncertainty and therefore job-loss. Less financiers = less terminals sold.

"1681","Culture wise, it's not perfect but this job attracts a lot of like-minded, reasonable, hardworking and honest talents that don't really go all out to harm others for their own benefits. Job wise, learning curve is steep in the beginning, flattens out after 8-9 months. Very number driven, schedule is micro managed, you can't have ""idle time"" cos they're watching you out.. Service impact is limited since we're chasing... numbers. Business decision is made top down from HQ so we're just executing a strategy that doesn't really apply to most of our clients in Asia. Yet management wants everyone to be superhumans that hit both number and quality of service.. Not sure if this is a bad thing or just reality of working for data vendors cos everyone's fresh out of school and hardly ever been working in clients' side.

Very hard to find a job if you stay more than a year. Most of the people who work... for company for years because they cannot find another job, not because they love the job.

And I have seen an outflow of real talented people for years. This is the top 1 place where you are supposed to spend much much more time and energy than you should in sucking up your boss.

Why not use that money to give higher bonuses and salaries? For NYC they're not that competitive IMHO. 
Another issue is opportunity and growth. The company is very hierarchical and people who are in management positions never move up. Therefore expect to be doing the same job for decades before seeing any promotion on the horizon. That's a big negative for most. 
Thirdly, expect to be criticized if you screw up, but don't expect too much praise if you do well.

While there is an occasional promotion of a women to a high-profile position, it's also a regular occurrence that a manager pass by the desks of women on his team to go ask a male colleague a question that the GIRLS could have answered. And, Bloomberg should be deeply embarrassed by the lack of African Americans. At some point, that may become a public... relations disaster for Mike. (As it should.)"

I'm not sure if the no rehire policy is still implemented, but I know Bloomberg has lost out on a number of... dedicated employees because of it.

If you forget to enter an expense report or forget to your employee... badge and require a temporary badge too many times in a month, your corporate email is turned off to ""teach you a lesson"".

The company proudly maintains a 'flat' organizational structure and an 'entrepreneurial' culture.  Unfortunately, in a company of 16,000+ employees, this translates to a chaotic work environment with little coordination across departments (and sometimes within departments!) and extremely limited opportunities for career progression. 

Senior management, who are about as white, straight, male and middle-aged/ elderly as you would expect from a company that straddles the infamously homogenous industries of technology and finance, have very little incentive to change anything or to promote people who don't look exactly like them."

Fulfilling work, it is not."
"1903","there is a proper balance between quantitative assessment and common sense. It shouldn't take that much man power to identify who is doing a good job and who is not. All this does is slow down the people who are doing something and allows the slackers a place to hide by gaming the system."

"1941","Management is never around, long hours, break is not paid. must work extra 30 mins. no guidance at all."
"1942","The culture very much reflects the personality of its founder and that of a trading firm. In many respects, this aggressive culture enables quick turnaround and strong results, however there is a dark side that can create an ultra competitive environment where no one trusts each other and where they are always out for number one at the expense of all else."
"1943","Be careful if you are above a certain age."
"1944","There are a lot of self serving people working there that do not care about the business."
"1945","Stacked ranking
Stacked ranking destroys a culture.  Period.  Speaking teamwork is lipservic, but really there are no teams  or in other words you are a team of one since stacked ranking. Best to the hard-working employees trapped there with no place else to go.  
B and C bosses, which means if you are an A player you will not be promoted as that would upend the B and C bosses. True or I couldn't say it."
"1946","No advice to management or else I'd have to bill you for it.
Actually you are your own just rewards, since your company is in big trouble, the industry is evolving and terminals have stopped growing you will have to deal with an irate mayor B who will demand more busy work."
"1947","The work can be repetitive. It's hard to switch things up. But if you find yourself getting bored, you can ask to be switched to a different team and learn another position."
"1948","Very unprofessional environment. Training non-existent. Disorganized, clumsy and unqualified personnel promoted into staff leading positions. Staff very unhappy and terrible atmosphere within the office. No one knows what they are doing from one day to the next."
"1949","Extremely disrespectful of staff. Need to remove key members of ""management"" team."
"1950","This is a work-hard environment, like any fast- growing company, you need to roll up your sleeves. To me this isn't a Con, but I see that to some it might be."
"1951","After the initial 8 week training period, you start as a generalist fielding questions from Bloomberg customers over an Instant Chat service. Essentially a glorified call centre role. After a stint of doing this from 1-2 years (some might be a bit quicker), you are assigned to a sales team where you put your knowledge of how the BBG terminal works to demonstrate the tools to clients. For the lucky few this may... involve a bit of travel, but in terms of actually what you are doing, it is just showing people how the bbg tools work face to face. I.e. show them how to pull up graphs, display their news properly. Once you get a bit more senior in the role you may start to show clients tools related to valuing swaps, options and how to chart using technical analysis. That said, there are always specialists who know more, so you never go into too much detail with clients. The main goal of you as a rep at this stage is to sell, and targets are clearly visible using internal systems to all employees and managers.

If you're not in the top half of the scoreboard you are harrassed about your performance. As one person on my team put it ""it was best to not be too good, as you will get noticed, but also not to be too bad, else you got noticed"" so the idea was to strategically not draw too much attention to yourself for fear of getting questioned on your performance.

Managers in this place are not actual 'managers' - in that they don't encourage, support nor get the most out of people. The company promotes from within, and so those who rise to managers are simply those who have stuck it out and have more 'familiarity' with the product. 

This is something the company needs to address, as having someone who is experienced and having someone who can manage others are clearly not one of the same thing. 

Managers (not just mine) have a reputation of micro-managing and creating a stressful environment for it's employees.

There is often a clique between managers and certain employees on the teams too (star performers) which excludes about 80% of the team so you do the math - this kind of culture will only serve to promote those at the top, when another way of looking at the same problem would be to raise the performance standard for everyone, and not to discriminate. This would be more socially and financially profitable to the team and culture.

Lots of things wrong with this organisation, but I guess it is similar to other places where at the end of the day it is all about sales. You either love that kind of environment or you don't."
"1952","Less micro management - give your employees room to grow. Treat all people fairly (surely that's just basic common sense? : )"

"1983","Limited areas for future career development"
"1984","overall flat and good"
"1985","Ok, here it goes. This office is a sinking ship. The entire department is an outdated mix of 20+ year analysts who are so complacent in their current roles that the first whisper of automation makes them cringe with the thought of losing their jobs. The attrition rate among younger employees is astronomical as they realize within 6 months of being there that this is the biggest waste of time and effort since their... freshmen year art elective. 
If you enjoy working with data, and by that I mean entering digit after digit without giving any thought whatsoever to what it means, and who uses it, then send in your resume their looking for people like you. 
There is no room for growth, although they will tell you differently through all the different seminars and information sessions. You start in data, you will end in data, unless you actively look for something better outside the company. And the reason for that brings me to my final point...
The upper management of Global Data in Princeton, NJ is the most inept, unintelligent, smug, condescending, bureaucratic, and just downright incompetent bunch of individuals to run a department. Most of them have been there since the building was opened, which somehow legitimizes there sense of entitlement. They preach transparency and collaboration yet they offer no insight and no growth opportunities, unless that means making their jobs easier so they have more time to talk about little league in the kitchen. They pick favorites with a nice smile and they let the rest fend for themselves. If you have any sense of self-worth, keep searching Glassdoor for jobs."
"1986","Engage the skilled employees or watch them leave."
"1987","Constant organizational restructuring by new heads of depts. In sales my territory & client coverage changes at least once sometimes twice per year"
"1988","Unless there is an absolute need stop reorganizing sales teams & regions"
"1989","Sales and Analytic department is a nightmare. You are on live chat with client that are constantly yelling at you. You have no choice , you need to deal with it. And this is not all. Your metric are based on call% (feel like to be in a call center) , number of chat resolved and also duration (how long it takes to solve the issue). So it's not just the stress of upset clients but also having your team leader eyes on... you because you are taking too long to get that resolve. 

Your manager will review your answers and put yo down sometimes for really no reason. At teh end you are so frustrated that you really just want to leave. Be very careful when you answer clients and how you are treating them because everyone can check what you are answering."
"1990","More flexibility."
"1991","Not sure about the career opportunities outside the firm. Within they are great, anyone can change basically to any position she wants after a couple years. But changing into ibd or a different industry, if one realises that its not for her,  I am not sure how well that would work, since the work is really specialised."
"1992","- Boring job – when I applied to work at Bloomberg, the job description sounded like it will involve at least some research/analysis of various asset classes (depending on what team you get assigned to). In reality, the job is basically a glorified caller center worker who tags data. My days consisted of moving data points from point A to point B, and dealing with angry clients asking why we make stupid mistakes.... Occasionally, you are given some “projects” which are either just simple and mind-numbing mass data corrections, or some aimless “improvement” requests that die down without real solutions several months later. I felt like my brain cells were slowly dying of inactivity during my tenure there.
- Clueless managers and apathetic colleagues – it’s true what they say about how quality of your work experience depends on the people you work with. Most managers are completely clueless, and they are where they are only because they’ve been working in the company for so long (and their peers who are actually qualified presumably left the firm long time ago). They have no idea how to run a department/team, but still love bossing around because they are delusional and power-tripping. They act as if they are in Wall Street by throwing around finance/management jargons and acronyms that have no applications to our operation, and seem to be only occupied with pleasing their own managers. I felt like I was in a big frat house where the managers were busy “bro-ing” with each other and their managers. In terms of your colleagues, there are three types: 1) those who are ambitious, smart, and motivated; 2) those who are neither smart nor motivated; and 3) those who are smart, but not motivated. Of those in the three categories, people in the first category quickly realize the limitation of the department and leave as quickly as possible. Thus, you are left to work with those who can’t perform because they lack the skills/intelligence, or won’t perform because they just don’t care. Either way, the quality of work that gets done is mediocre at best. The worst part of all of this is that before not too long, you will find yourself in one of the latter two categories at some point if you decide to stay for too long.
- Laughable technology – for a company who claims to be a leader in the financial data business, the technology used in the firm is a joke for the most part, and once again, mediocre at best. The management refuses to invest serious money into developing a better system; instead, they only invest in cheaper patching-up solutions just to get by. 
- No growth opportunity – the company has a very flat structure, which means that there are very few management positions available. You learn absolutely nothing that is applicable outside of your team, so most people are stuck doing the same things year after year. If you are smart and good at what you do, your chance of being promoted actually seems to decrease since they are worried that they won’t be able to find a suitable replacement for you. There are options to apply to transfer internally (or to NYC), but the competition is very tough, and even if you are able to transfer, more likely than not you will be doing similar tasks that you have been doing – just with a different asset class. Those who are motivated/smart enough to learn new skills don’t even bother applying internally – they simply leave the firm.
- Long lines for bathroom stalls – I don’t see any previous reviewers mentioning it, but this is a real problem in the Skillman office. I don’t know what they do (nor do I want to know) in the bathroom stalls, but regardless of when you go to the bathroom, there is *always* a line for stalls. It wasn’t rare for people to wait 5-10 minutes in line. Apparently going number two is a privilege in that office. My current colleagues think that I’m making this up, but sadly, I’m not. 

My apologies for the long review, but in short, if you have even half a brain and think that you have a shot at being successful at any other place, do yourself a favor and stay away from this place."
"1993","Instead of pushing away all the promising younger employees, wipe out all the low- and mid-level managers, especially the ones who have kept the same position for nearly a decade. It’s clear that there are so many other employees who deserve to be promoted, and keeping the current managers will only further decrease the morale level among the analysts. They should also consider bringing managers from outside the... company who have proper management experience and skills. Finally, stop lying to the job applicants about what their responsibilities will be. Bloomberg is NOT Goldman or JPM, so stop acting like one."

To top it all off, you're in central New Jersey with slim prospects... of moving to another Bloomberg office within 18 months, which leads to high attrition rates and low morale among young employees and a collective sense that this is a place where careers go to die, and should be used temporarily as a stepping stone while you study for the CFA. People jokingly call 'Global Data' 'Global Data Entry', and this name fits. 

Yes, data processing may be inherently tedious work, however that is greatly exacerbated when the department has collectively shrugged its shoulders at any legitimate efforts to utilize the widespread advances in technology and data processing automation of the last 15 years, instead relying on questionable and incredibly outdated tools and processes (literally, in many cases these ave not been updated at all since the 1990s). Management talks the talk of leveraging technology (OMG the crowd! codecademy!), but in most cases these solutions are far too little too late and are further hurt by a lack of any legitimate R&D support. Analysts with little to no technical background (who are further surrounded by older employees with no desire for change) can only do so much. 

Compared with the glamorous Bloomberg offices in NYC and the rest of the world as well as the incredible funding we pour into the (money-hemorrhaging) news department, the Skillman office feels like the forgotten stepchild of the Bloomberg corporate family."
"2014","First off, take a look around and recognize how overpaid and underqualified you are to be the management of this relatively important department at a global company. Congratulations: you made it, somehow. 

Second off, recognize the fact that having 90% of your management team be people who have spent their entire lives in central NJ and who have spent their entire careers within one office at Bloomberg is not a... good way to run this department, unless you are hoping to run it into the ground. 

Then, take a look at the massive attrition rates you have among younger employees and realize that few people want to spend their early/mid twenties living in suburban NJ hoping daily that they'll somehow get transferred to New York. This is a great way to lose tons of young talent, which is one of the few things that management here is really fantastic at. Again, congratulations. 

Then, when looking to orient your department in a more technology-driven direction (or even just any direction that's not laughably inefficient), cause it's 2016 and manually inputting data on barely readable screens built in 1997 isn't really acceptable anymore, try getting HR to hire people with actual CS and programming skills and backgrounds rather than throwing people without any experience into technical roles and hoping something good will happen (hint: it probably won't). Work in the Skillman office seems to have been frozen in time since 2004 and with every passing year things get less and less efficient and young employees get more and more frustrated (and leave)."

-Totally incompetent managers who have never done the job that the team they are ''managing'' does. 
-Managers do nothing. My manager attended Bloomberg University courses (which tend to be classes that promote self image, and horoscope styled ''personality'' courses) and little else. No help or input was ever heard from her, only criticisms which were unwarranted-due to the fact that she... didn't understand anything about the department and never worked in it prior to becoming  a manager. How did this happen you may ask? It happened because higher management also has no clue and do nothing. 
-Extremely understaffed department. Team of 10 people handed 60,000 inquiries in my last month. 
-Compensation in laughable.
-Bloomberg  is 'big brother' personified. Tabs are kept on every single move you make.
-The level of Micromanagement is absurd. I felt I was treated more like a toddler than an adult. 
-Hypocritical managers: I was reprimanded for being late by two minutes once, while my manager wouldn't scold others who walked in 30 minutes late every day. 
-Culture of fear. Managers live to intimidate their team members.
-Every single thing you do at Bloomberg must be recorded in their internal ticketing system. If your manager didn't like the way you record something, you will be threatened with termination. 
-Open seating floor plans are usually a good idea, however at Bloomberg this means you get 2 square feet of your own space before you bump into your neighbor. If one person on your floor is sick, everyone will be sick within 3 days. Absolutely no privacy.
-Culture of Brainwashing. People who have been at Bloomberg for over 2 years can not form a sentence in or out of work without saying ''Bloomberg'' at least once. 
-Bloomberg pretends that there is good career advancement, but in reality, all roles are glorified call center type roles. Pay increases for employees are less than inflation rates.

-Bloomberg stunts professional growth as employees never see outside business practices and are trapped in a Bloomberg bubble.

Many people there have been an 'analyst' of some sort for over 10+ years.

There is an illusion of an open process but in reality it is all determined before most positions are listed.  

Metrics:  How many widgets did you process this week? Expect Metric-driven reviews full of buzz-word evaluations with phrases like 'know the customer' that tend to avoid any useful details.  Again if you are liked by your manager somehow this will work out in your favor.  If not, expect a lot of sub-par reviews.  

Disappointing management:  Most of the management tends to focus on their own career advancement vs. the career / well-being of their own employees.  I've seen 'Team Leaders' side with upper management again and again rather than risk their future by protecting or standing up for employees.  This leads to higher than average turnover and a certain degree of employee cynicism.  For an 'open' office many managers can be quite stand-offish and refuse to interact during the day even after many years of working side-by-side.

Crowded:  An open office setting means that you can never really focus in peace and quiet - bring headphones or get ready to hear a lot of annoying chatter and phone calls. The company tends to bring in armies of temps and interns and space is VERY limited.  For some reason all of the Bloomberg offices are short on bathrooms - expect to wait in a long line whenever nature calls."

Working in the ""Analytics"" department is very misleading.  In no way are you an analyst. In no way are you learning the skill set to become an analyst. ... You are not reviewing balance sheets, or capital structures, or debt distributions.  You are a minion, a cog in a wheel, a beast of burden, forever in fear of the dreaded QC.

Often you will know within the first 6months to a year if you will stay or leave. The company values loyalty, there are many home grown talents, whose only job in their life is Bloomberg, however some of them might lack maturity and all they know is the Bloomberg way.

"2169","I received an oral offer as R & D software engineer a year before my graduation. Three months later, their recruiter gave me a phone call and reneged it, without caring or taking any responsibility of the other offers and interviews I have declined for them. 

I received an oral offer over the phone after interviewing them on campus around end of Sep, 2015. Since I still have a year left in school and only taking... two masters courses, I asked for a part-time intern opportunity to work in their Princeton office, mostly to get familiar with their teams and development environment. Before the intern started I told their manager about my availability constraints ( only available this semester & winter , and would take time off during exams ) and they told me it's fine and sent me an part-time intern offer letter to sign on. On the contract it says ""Expected work hours per week : 10 hrs"". Also, either the manager or part-time offer letter mentioned anything about its potential impact of my full-time offer.

Then I interned at a team throughout Nov.2015 - Jan.2016, worked mostly 4 days a week, averaging 25 ~ 30 hrs for the weeks I came to work. I took a whole week off during finals and another week during Christmas and New Year. 

The program itself is very disorganized : No intern / new hire training, no clarification of performance expectation, no assigned project, and no desk. Yes I never had a desk assigned to me throughout the entire internship. I was told to fix bugs in their current production code and I worked closely with my mentor on daily basis. I managed to fix all the bugs they assigned to me and my code went to production.

After telling them I wouldn't be able to work part-time after my last semester starts, as we agreed upon before I start interning, I received a phone call from Bloomberg's recruiter couple weeks later said they would renege on my full-time offer. ""Based on your review from your team, your technical ability has no problem, but it's the communication issue. Therefore we decided to not give you full-time offer"". Later that night I called my mentor and he told me he knew what I did, he was satisfied about my performance since I was able to pick up their project and fix bugs quickly. He insisted to keep me in the team, but their team lead who never assigned anything to me or worked with me claimed I am not dedicated to the company since I took days off during final. Recruiting team did not take any responsibility of the other offers and interviews I have declined, insisted the decision is final and there's nothing I can do about it.

I talked to my friends and professional engineers who had experience with Bloomberg. This company has a terrible record of reneging people' offer / fire new employees during their recruiting process. They basically don't care about how it would effect your career as a software engineer. You are a new grad who is not experienced with employment laws / process, and they would do whatever they need as long as they think it would benefit their company. Be very careful if you are considering Bloomberg as your full-time employer, they have reneged / fired people before they join, during their new hire training, even in your first six months.

After all this is a company which would say ""Technical ability is fine, but team lead doesn't like your communication "" to renege an incoming engineer's offer."

"2179","The reality is it's actually very hard to move internally at Bloomberg despite what they try to say as roles are highly specialized and this is a serious downfall for those not in the know. If you're a journalist or developer, that's not the case. But for those in product management or specific verticals, moving within the company can be punishing. Sometimes even the most qualified candidates don't get chosen for a... role based on a manager's whim. It's also very hard to move back to a role once you've left one so employees can get stuck, even when they are highly skilled and knowledgeable. You basically have to wait for someone to transfer or get fired and then hope a manager in power will take you back. One could wait years for a role to open, so it usually ends up with the employee voluntarily leaving. Thus making a career here is not for everyone. Certain departments function extremely well like core product whereas media and enterprise are faced with constant reorgs and management challenges. Work/balance non existent in certain departments. The company tries to act like it embraces promotion of women and minorities but in practice it's far from reality. They have tried to move positively in the direction of greater flexibility but it really varies depending on the department/role/manager. It's not uncommon for some employees to be expected to work 12 hours a day with the average being 10, making it not very family friendly. Especially at headquarters."
"2180","Be more flexible for skilled employees looking to move departments that want to stay and have a track record of success. Promote from within instead of bringing people off the street to be managers with no track record. It's amazing how many very competent people work at Bloomberg that could be grown into managers with a little bit of attention."
"2181","Opaque, annoying management with a bit of rank-and-yank Wall Street BS. Frequent management changes meant oral promises were never kept."
"2182","Bloomberg is in constant flux, hiring lavishly on some while laying off others. There have been so many changes recently that nobody knows what the priorities will be next next and so many are afraid their jobs may be in jeopardy at any time. Additionally, once hired, pay raises are tough to come by."
"2183","Figure out what you want to be as a company. Until they sort that out, they will continue to lose their best reporters and editors.

"2262","the company is very political"

2. Outright discrimination"
"2273","Mr. B is fantastic, the company culture is great but if you don't invest in middle management, lot of good resources will leave."
"2274","Everything is overly routinised and one becomes simply a number in terms of performance evaluation and role in the company. There is little room for creativity in writing and emphasis is placed on business / economic reporting rather than journalism. While the hours are good, one is expected to work with their nose to the grindstone during working hours. Everything is tracked in terms of the speed of breaking news,... number of pieces published and the number of ""clicks"" a story receives. One feels like they are reduced to a mere number in terms of performance. This is very different when compared to other new outfits."
"2275","Make employees feel more like they are part of a team; place more emphasis on skill development and growth; ""lighten up"" the culture of the organisation."

"2278","there are no cons aside from tedious work - suck it up"
"2279","It's very big brother and you feel that you are being watched. It varies from dept to dept and of course who you have for a manager. BBG is not a flexible working environment at all. The hours can be quite long. They have a strong no nepotism policy for externals but nothing for internals, its contradictory as a senior leader would move to a dept and take 20+ in senior mgt from her previous dept- if that's not... nepotism I am not  sure what is!"
"2280","If you are promoting innovation don't knock those with ideas. Ideas are seemed to be welcomed but in reality it's not. If you challenge management your career is good as gone."
"2281","-Not much career progression available"
"2282","None so far. I need to fill 20 words minimum to get this thing setup properly. That is the con for the app"
"2283","-Very flat structure that often leaves little room to advance one's career, if someone is trying to advance as an internal hire; senior managers are generally outside hires.
-Businesses are very silo'd, making it difficult to transition across groups easily

"2289","They run a tight ship and don't give enough flexibility to journalists to develop big stories or off-beat stories."
"2290","A little too young in that there is a lack of maturity and credibility in many leaders and sales people. A culture that is very focused on them and not clients. No privacy. Big brother type atmosphere that breeds paranoia."
"2291","Hire some folks over 40. Make it more about the client. Trust your employees more and allow them to challenge the status quo."
"2292","- If you get placed in a team or are in a department with bad/incompetent/micro-managing/ nonsensical-metric-oriented managers then you will feel like another cog in the wheel and be very disheartened. 
- The standard hours are a little too long and inflexible (but the pros of this still stands).
- Some over promising and under delivering with career progression, you are at the mercy of your manager or team leader."
"2293","For departments such as Analytics - please stop the ridiculous campaigns, micromanagement and metrics and treat your staff like adults. Nurturing a more organic atmosphere where individuals within teams are given some autonomy to add value to clients in creative ways would yield a far better result in terms of customer satisfaction and staff retention. If the managers are worried about the end of year meeting to vie... for a cut of the bonus pot through what the department has achieved, then this approach would work better as the sky is the limit. With campaigns and set targets, people will stop once they have reached the bare minimum.

To upper management - R&D needs as much funding as possible but otherwise you're doing a great job; Bloomberg still has a bright future."

"2304","not that I know of"
"2305","need to find ways to provide more market knowledge to their employees to know more about the clients and the external market rather than just be satisfied with knowing what works within the company"
"2306","you need to know that you cannot keep asking more of your employees and not wanting to give on certain parts. there has to be a trade off somewhere sometime and you need to balance out the needs of the clients with the capacity of employees"
"2307","Not much vision for career advancement other than the raise and compensation. Upper management is pretty much not moving at all. Can notice a lot of politics in the upper management. Very corporate. Very financy atmosphere -- feels uptight overall, so R&D makes an extra effort to make it chill. For the engineers who are actually interested in finance (which isn't the case for many people.. but for these special... kind), this is THE place to work at.. otherwise.. just not so much motivating or fun."
"2308","Leading the group to strive for the better product always helps motivate engineers. Managers should not forget to protect the team members from upper management drama, and always help them grow."
"2309","- Career Opportunities.  Now this depends on individuals' goals, but from coming from a small company in the financial industry, I've found that opportunities here are very limited.  After you've worked in the industry for some time, projects complete, and they turn into maintenance mode (aka ""keeping the lights on"") in the company.  This is very necessary evil since once functions complete, support needs to remain... for the function, but this lowers the amount of meaningful work that can be done.  Those that want to change things up will generally be pointed towards the direction of management.
- Challenges.  This expands on the above point.  Unfortunately, the amount of challenges in this company are very limited.  The problems can be difficult, but with the wrong reasons.  This includes challenges from compliance, poor design, and complex internal architecture.  There's significantly less ""fun"" challenges in the work compared to a startup or smaller shop.  This can lead to some days that feel terribly long due to working on mind-numbing tasks.  All companies will have these tasks, but Bloomberg seems to have a lot more do to their extensive use of proprietary tools.
- Legacy technologies.  Bloomberg is involved with ""modern"" technologies like Hadoop/HBase and Redis, but a very large portion of the foundation software is still C++98 (with a Bloomberg Standard Library to cover some of the C++11 features), but the technology lags behind significantly due to all the dependencies in the software."
"2310","Not much to advise here since a lot of the problems that come up are inevitable in a large company.  The quality of employees here are pretty top-notch, and the benefits are absolutely nothing to complain about."
"2311","Worst department dynamics I have ever experienced. Employees are treated like slaves."
"2312","Get a clue. Fire all management in managerial roles. Have them take chats and work with customers 50% of their day. All new management needs to take yearly training courses on how to work with people. HR needs to take the blinders off and see what's really happening in this department."
"2313","There is nothing I need to write on con section"
"2314","You guys are doing very good! Keep up the goo work guys!"
"2315","Suggerirei alla compagnia di velocizzare il processo ma è la mia opinione, in ogni caso ho apprezzato l'ambiente e la visione"
"2316","Suggerirei di velocizzare tutto il processo di domanda. Inoltre, suggerirei di cambiare un po' la visione della compagnia su chi non è matematico ma più analitico"
"2317","Misleading job advert, data entry job dressed up as being an Analyst job - some teams are better than others but many people do copy paste.

Must spend minimum 18 months in data before can move internally to sales etc. Data is in smaller separate building so you have no interaction with people from the rest of the organisation although this will change when move to new office currently under construction.

Near... complete lack of exposure to intelligent people to learn from, as to be expected from data entry role... Smarter people with industry experience work in other teams in completely different building.

Strange infantile environment, like being back at school. You will be treated like a child. Cult-like. Micromanagement."
"2318","Not an Analyst job, change job advert, be more honest it is data entry!!"
"2319","No lunches were provided. The internship program is obviously designed for software engineers"
"2320","Absolutely no point in expecting to have a life outside of this  organisation, if you want to have the ability to work from home flexibly then forget about it. Make sure you check the job description properly when applying and if in a specialist role, make sure it does not involve ADSK/SDSK. 

Was told on interview that it's a project based role, in actuality it's glorified customer support. 

Do not work here if... you have children, the hours and lack of flexibility would not lend itself to you. Anyone that does have children has had to take a pay cut or make some kind of sacrifice."
"2321","Think about your staff and their families. You need to seriously understand the impact work has on lives, if you live by the motto ""work to live"" you'll suffer with staff turnover."
"2322","Lots of hoops to jump through due to company size, annoying tasks that are not relevant, outdated pricing model, work itself not super interesting."
"2323","Listen to clients for once..."
"2324","Limited career growth opportunities
A lot of politics and favoritism in the team
Very hard to move around without any connection
A lot of metrics
Good for people who look to retire but not for people who wants to keep growing"

Limited the managers authority and use performance metric to promote pplz
Increase the salary since it is lower than average industry"
"2326","poor career progress opportunities. This company is a slow moving large organization where change is extremely painful and difficult."
"2327","Management needs to value innovation and challenge and foster growth."
"2328","Outdated technology, many groups don't do any actual development. Outsourcing is rampant outside of core terminal business."
"2329","You've lost focus - get back to the basics and do fewer things. Bloomberg is a great brand, but it's spread too thinly."
"2330","The role is heavily metrics based"

Lack of energy in management to try new things"
"2332","Try and find a way to become cutting edge in tech again, but otherwise keep it up"
"2333","Empresa engessada muito dependente do que a matriz quer. Empresa composta por Gerentes e não líderes. Empresa vende uma coisa internamente mas nem sempre cumpre com o que diz. Para chegar a algum lugar, há de ser muito político. Nunca discorde de seu chefe."

"2342","everything is ok, nothing to change"
"2343","Too much work politics. Most Managers have been with the company from inception and have not yet caught up with the new and better way of managing. And no diversity especially from upper management."
"2344","Promote who are hard not who you like."
"2345","Large company so changes to products sometimes do not come fast enough. Difficult to take on a project and see it through to completion as there are so many internal obstacles. Typical large corp red tape."
"2346","Find a better system of evaluating practical ideas and solutions and enhancements and create a fast lane for these to get executed."
"2347","Management treats you like a number/statistic, all the talk is in numbers whether there are enough headcount, even lower levels of management."
"2348","They promote flexibility and internal job moves, but don't actually practice it well."
"2349","Develop stronger culture with external hires."
"2350","Lots of cliques, particularly in the older teams. Avoid the older teams."
"2351","Modernize legacy teams. Pay more attention to software best practices."
"2352","Sometimes there's an over reliance on legacy technologies and a safety first strategy can sometimes hinder development cycles."
"2353","Keep doing what you're doing! Open more development centres in other parts of the world to attract international talent."
"2354","hard working flow, the way calculate matrics sometimes does not make sense"
"2355","There's also a lot of levels of bureaucracy to battle through for higher things, as the company is relatively centered around New York. The standard working day is 10 hours. 

Be prepared to come across inexperienced managers who have been approved to climb the corporate ladder much too quickly."
"2356","Reconsider working hours to be standardised across all regions. Promote managers with more scrutiny. Shift balance of power from New York to other regions"

"2358","Long hours, some managers are poor"

"2360","Salaries are too low, too many ratings metrics which are not reflective of quality sales performance"
"2361","Los bocadillos te disuaden de salir del edificio. Las horas globales también te disuaden de salir. Puede ser difícil lograr un equilibrio entre el trabajo y la vida personal."
"2362","La dirección debería volver a poner en práctica la política de revisión de 360 grados en la que se revisa tanto a los gerentes como a los que trabajan para ellos. Sería beneficioso para todos."
"2363","Boring job, not stimulating at all"
"2364","Need to motivate people more!"
"2365","The corporate structure was just so complicated that no one could really explain it to me, and how I fit into the team. Very frustrating at times and ultimately no one's fault, just the way it was."

"2382","Non ci sono aspetti negativi, è stata un'esperienza fantastica"
"2383","Bloomberg cultures might seem like idealized or abstract there will be cases when it does not feel like the cultures are there at all specially when doing routinary tasks. How much the company is amazing as it sounds depends on how much you get involved in it. You have to take extra time and effort if you really want to rip the benefits of working in a company that pretends to be so unique. Given the industry the... company operates on compensation could be better but then I have never heard anyone saying the salary they have is enough. Depending on your role it can feel that the way your performance is evaluated is a little too much archaic. As an outsider the company definitely looks and sounds much better than it actually is."
"2384","Needs to review how performance is evaluated, in my opinion is too much based in objective numbers and not enough in other types of beneficial contribution."
"2385","It s more a data role, so it is not too analytical"
"2386","Unbelievable internal politics, poor opportunities for career advancement unless you fight & fight, long hours (8-6 standard), poor work/life balance, poor morale and happiness amongst staff. They are probably reaching the maximum of the number of terminals they can install."
"2387","be more friendly to your staff - they aren't ""resources"" who can be milked until they are dry. Mike Bloomberg is making the company less and less of a nice place to be."

"2413","no real downside. Could be better on compensation. But great life balance"
"2414","The need for intense security makes getting the simple things accomplished frustratingly painful. . Bloomberg wants everyone to succeed and utilize your time to the fullest, but it seems to set all of their systems up to make it as non-intuitive as possible thereby making it twice as hard to get anything done."
"2415","If I had the solution, I would be CEO."
"2416","If you don't like having your work visible via the Terminal or if you're not a morning person or if you are lazy, Bloomberg is a bad place to work. If you need an office with a door, Bloomberg is a bad place to work. Management at times can be a bit aggressive as they try to wring every ounce of productivity out of you."
"2417","Micro-managed, no freedom, targets can be unrealistic but if and when you do hit them but whatever means, rewards can be decent though not substantial.  If wanting to move into the market, it can be difficult to get out of the ""vendor"" title."

Performance review is stack ranking based and the managers have the... full say. As a result, employees are discouraged to share knowledge, but fight politics internally to be close to the managers. Individual contributors are less likely to disagree with the managers/TLs' idea. Wrong person get promoted/demoted time to time, not because of performance, but as a result of political matter.

R&D level
Poor software practice in the R&D, where almost non-existence of the automated software testing (not even at the unit-test level). The company encourage employees to be innovative firm-wide, however in practice, engineers are discouraged (indirectly) to innovate due to fear of breaking things. I personally knew at least 2 engineers were fired due to the production bugs they created. From my knowledge, the most senior managers in R&D are technical with some of the good visions. However, many of the mid, mid-senior level managers, are not technical at all. These people are usually the decision makers and I saw many missteps in the decision making progress during my 5 years there.

-You are a glorified call center agent. Your ""metrics"" are kept track of ie number of completed chats vs taken chats, time on the phone, quality of chat (majority of the time... the ""quality"" of your chat will depend on how much the person reviewing likes you). These metrics are bench marked against the other 400 people in your department. 

- Although there is a metric system in place, if you are liked by your manager regardless of your metrics you can move onto sales although this is a rare.

Sales and Analytics  is viciours, as you spend more time within the department you realize there are no exit opportunities internally.

The structure of the building is nice to look at however moving around from one location to the next, is terrible. It takes so much time to go to your next meeting because the elevators do not stop at all floors and you have to go to different banks to get the one you need, which stills means there are some stairs involved somehow. UFFF.... There's no privacy- not that you need it at your job however when you work in upper mgmt there's some confidentiality needed however not at this place. This is definitely big brother watching type company. the moment you enter the building and swipe your badge your steps are being monitored. That's due to your badge that must be around your neck to move through the halls. They can tell where you are in the building and when you're in the building by logging in and simply typing a persons name and they can find out where you're  working from, how you're answering emails. It provides a symbol Red x (out of the office) Blue Cell phone, at Computer symbol for at your desk or whether you're remotely. its not too bad however I wasn't used to people knowing everything, and not that I had anything to hide however it was more the thought of knowing that everyone in the company knows this info is a little creepy. They expect the best and the most out of everyone, which they should, however its counter productive because you're not giving the tools and/or resources to complete a task, however they still expect the outcome to be superb execution with resourcefulness (being cheap). To get anything that you need, you have to put a ""ticket"" for any and everything and based on their requests, which is many on a daily basis, it could be a week before you get what you need to do your job. That ticket thing drove me crazy. you can't just call up IT with a computer issue, you have to put in a ticket. If there's a printer issue, you have to put in a ticket. You have a phone issue, you have to put in a ticket. to book a conference room you have to put in a ticket, and beyond for that. Because there aren't any titles, there's no one above anyone else, however that's still a problem because to me this sets up a lot of competition between each other in a counter productive sort of way. Everyone wants to show and wear their, positions, intelligence and wherewithal on their sleeves- and shoulders. It's actually unbelievable and i actually thought I could get used to that, but sheesh, I left with a headache every evening.  Oh, and did I mention that to log onto your computer, its done by your finger print, user name and password, along with all of your important info about yourself, which made me a little apprehensive about sharing my background info, such as school, every job I've had, time frames- hr info everything. It's kind of crazy that I'm even sharing that little tidbit. God forbid, someone was to hack into their systems, they will have everyone's info along with your finger prints. And it is mandatory to provide your picture, and background information or in 3 months your computer shuts down and in order to log back on you need to call IT and also include your info.  It's a private company so do not expect much. Also, if there stock exchange is open, you will be working. Rain, sleet or snow. You are expected to work from home if you're in a area where the roads are blocked, transportation issues or inclement weather.  There's only 3 holidays a year. Thanksgiving day, Christmas  Day, and New Years Day. Maybe when I started I had missed a few of them however after a year of employment, i only remember 3. I was able to take my vacation however upon resigning I was paid for 2 weeks because I did not use them all (no complaint there). I know some companies are moving more into open-floor plans but this is really difficult because you are literally elbow to elbow with colleagues. You hear everyone's conversation whether you want to or not, you can't help but to hear. There's constant interruptions because instead of people sending an email or calling you, they look to see if you're at your desk and walk over and interrupt and will actually stand there, even if you say give me a minute. To have a confidential business call, is impossible! Also, the pay bi monthly (on the 15th, and last day of the month)  not every 2 weeks. (you can get used to that, I did but thought it should be mentioned before hearing from the HR person) Thank goodness I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck. Oh and did I mention there are microphones through out the floors and hallways? Ufff. The safest place is the 6th floor which is the biggest snack room, company lobby. you must go to the 6th floor before you can go to any other of floor. Don't get me wrong, this place is great for a first job, or on the finance side money wise however the rest, media, is just so so. remember there's no board members and public stock, its a private company so there's only an OWNER. I was wide eyed and amazed and thought I had landed a fantastic opportunity, and it was however after leaving I realized my expectations were way too high. i actually thought I had won the victory, by joining this company, but the cost of losing a year of experience on this job was not worth it. I've never written a review before however if I can just help one person give it a second thought before making Bloomberg a choice, I wanted to lay out all of the little things that will drive you crazy. Don't settle or negotiate what you want, because they will try to tell that they salaries are low but the bonus make up for it. NOT. There's always an excuse. I wish I had known just a bit of this before turning down another offer for this one. I know this company works for some people and thats great. This just means that this review isn't for you.

Bloomberg will help you if you have a position you are more interested in, but it is easy to get too comfortable. Also, you have to enjoy watching the markets from the sidelines instead of participating. It is a data driven job, so it can be pretty boring... and not too analytical."

"2666","take a long hard look at salaries and actual jobs (reading call notes, not working with clients) being done by middle managers.  Young hardworking traveling sales reps are treated as replaceable while very many ""fat cats"" lead by reputation, tenure, and general status."
"2667","All the free food might weigh you down.  There are also some elitist managers who see your green badge and will be overtly curt and condescending, regardless of your education or expertise.  Being hired full-time is possible if you perform well and positions are open, but the interview process is somewhat abstract, and you can be routed to other departments instead of the position you're actually applying for. ... Unless you're also an expert in whatever this surprise department specializes in, you'll fail and won't be given an explanation as to why.  I wound up interviewing with a bunch of college grads gunning for an entry level job in an unrelated field instead of what I actually applied for.  The interview was embarrassing."

Ancient archaic systems that don't communicate with each other so lots of time consuming handwork rather than automation because the systems built are old and inefficient. Everything there causes you to work longer hours because its so inefficient. Everything is... done via a ticketing system that actually stops people from communicating like human beings. Blatant favoritism is rampant. Male chauvinist piggy environment. Little minority representation in management. Ageism, many people let go all over 50. Tons of spin cycle because business leads don't know what they want. Badly written non approved briefs meant limited resources were spin cycling for nothing. They will tell you over and over that you suck and that you did this wrong, even if they guided you down the wrong path. They don't want to hear your solutions, they want to cling to their dysfunction like its a life line. Seriously limited resources so can barely get anything done. Nasty nasty sarcastic directors that have no idea how to talk to people and get the most out of them. Rule by fear not by respect. Microphones hanging from ceilings to listen on your conversations. God help you if you have critical thinking and speak up. You'll be knocked down, and the system will chew you up and remind you that resistance is futile. Extremely bad morale, everyone looks horrible because there is no life work balance. Everyone is scared as its a culture of fear so lots of bad behavior and throwing of people under the bus. Constantly changing the system and organization so nothing ever is given enough time to make it work. Changes are made with no notification, no outlines or workflow charts.

• nearly impossible to take a vacation day
• terrible upper management
• the job itself is just absolutely terrible
• treated like the garbage dump of problems within the company
• you have to dress up for literally no reason
• force you to work weekends and holidays with little incentives
• very hard to move onto another job role in the company

1. Impossible to take a... vacation day:
The department only allows 4 people to have scheduled time off on a given day. This means you need to schedule time off way too far in advance (like over a month) for a single day off.  I had to take random Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays off throughout the year just to use my vacation days

2. Terrible upper management:
Your boss's boss has favorites and those are the people who get promoted to other positions.  In addition to that, I honestly can't remember a single meaningful conversation I had with him in. The 2.5 years I was there.

3. The job is terrible
I will summarize your job here: You sit at your desk for 8 hours taking calls about broken keyboards, bad internet, and problems you can't fix because the Bloomberg application was written in the 80s and still behaves that way. You get little to no help from resources within the company regarding this problems.  In addition to all that, you also get chats from Bloomberg users regarding their problems. All of this happens simultaneously so you basically get no break.

4.Treated like the garbage dump:
Everyone's technical problems that no one can figure out goes to GTEC and there's no hope of solving them because 9 timed out of 10 it's for another department.  You can't send the ticket back to them because you'll get QAed poorly and it effects your performance review

5. You have to dress up for no reason
We don't see any outside clients EVER. We don't work in the main office where they do Bloomberg news, so I don't understand the reason to dress up.

6. Working weekends
You are forced to work weekends. You don't get overtime (which I believe is against the law).  They give you a free day off. The weekends are just as bad as the weekdays expect worse because you have to work 10-7

7. Very hard to move within the company
Because all you'll know how to do is fix the Bloomberg application its very hard to move to a different role in the company (and outside the company too). I looked for over 6 months and couldn't find anything. All the jobs that get posted seem to already have someone lined up to take it."
"2762","Get with the times, have some leeway, make work fun, show some interest in your employees"

"2784","The management style at Bloomberg tends to be top-down and fear-based. As a result, employees spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out who among the leadership is in and who is out, which causes a continual undercurrent of anxiety.  Although the salaries tend to be much higher than print salaries elsewhere, it comes at a cost: Journalism principles are easily trumped by business prerogatives.  (See... ""Bloomberg in China."") True journalists find this model fundamentally flawed, since most believe that challenging the orthodoxy is precisely what journalism is all about."
"2785","It's not an accident that management operates the way it does; it's Mike Bloomberg's style. As happens in most companies, his basic style sets the tone throughout the company. So unless Bloomberg can be convinced of the benefits of a different management style (leading to greater creativity and flourishing, say)  that offset the time that more enlightened management requires (time is money) it's unlikely that any... significant change is possible except around the margins."

"2800","You're not going to break the bank here.  In rating compensation/benefits, the tilt is considerably towards the benefits side.  Open environment can lead to too many interruptions at certain points.  Some of the business philosophy is too focused on getting things done rather than getting the right things done.  Career path is always pretty foggy.  If you're not into management, it can be very tough to really make... your mark. Management itself can be made more difficult than it needs to be. The evaluation structure is somewhat archaic, is based on ridiculous apples to oranges comparisons across the company and doesn't provide middle managers with much flexibility."

"2806","Train your managers and listen to the employees who are doing all the work."
"2807","If you read the booked 1984, you would know how the company is managed. From top down, managers practice micro-managing like a foreign spy. They check Account Manager's schedules, and call clients after  a meeting has occurred to ensure the sales reps were there. If you are 5-10 mins late from arriving to work (strict 8-6 schedule), expect a threatening email or confrontation. Not a lot of trust and confidence in... its people, which creates a paranoid and low morale office environment. 

The strategy of this department is to entice young college entrants to take a higher than average entry level salary, and once in, don't expect a high pay raise at all. Many people find their skills outdated after a few years and stuck in the job - with different titles but the same role. That's how lifers are created in this company - they have no transferrable skills to transition to another company, and with little management skills, they are pressured into taking a manager role (to give them more work to do), which leads to teams that are poorly run. This is a vicious cycle across the whole sales floor.

If you are looking for a long-term career, this is definitely not the place. By joining, you are automatically going to be behind many people on gaining relative industry skills that makes you competitive. Many managers that I have worked with don't even know how to use Excel and Powerpoint.. so please assess if you are looking for something short term or longer term in your next career move."
"2808","Foster a more trusting work environment. LIsten to the 360 reviews, and manage your Sales Managers better."
"2809","Management generally poor. Pressure to work long hours.  Definitely NOT a meritocracy. Poor work-life balance."
"2810","At one point around 2003, a memo was sent around which explained that a 10 hour work day was MANDATORY.  Apparently someone in management later discovered this not permitted according to official labor laws and made sure to never again make this an official requirement.  Yet managers continued to verbally tell their staff that they must put in a minimum of 10 hours at the office each day.  For salespeople, this... meant that on days after returning from 12+ hour days on the road, the 10 hour minimum was still in effect.  

I attended a recruiting event for new hires many years ago where the branch manager told all those in attendance that Bloomberg is a ""true meritocracy.""  I found it very ironic that he would say such a thing, as it was fairly common knowledge at that branch that he was given his position even though there were more qualified people there who were passed over because they were not as skilled at brown-nosing as he was..."
"2811","London Analytics (ADSK) was the worst experience of my working career. In my opinion, the role was oversold and it seems as though it was more important to get ""talent"" into the Analytics department than to retain it. The role was void of stimulation. One was made to feel like a robot, with every action of the day being monitored and metric'd. It was an environment that was not dissimilar to what I would imagine it... would be like to work in a call centre (not that I have anything against call centres, but would expect something slightly more stimulating given the number of years I spent studying and working in the industry). One's day is completely determined by management, from the time you arrive to the time you leave, right down to determining at what time during the day that you could take lunch. If you were away from your desk for more than ten minutes, it was likely that a manager had tried to contact you to see where you were and why you were not taking client queries. Training for the role is inadequate and for the first few months I was dealing with many queries relating to the sounds that the Bloomberg terminal was (or was not) making instead of much to do with finance. It would've been funny if it weren't so depressing. The queries became more relevant/finance-related as I became 'more' (according to Bloomberg management) qualified to take them on. There were hardly any breaks between taking queries and one was taking on an endless stream of some or other query about the Bloomberg terminal. It was a mind-numbing, stressful (and not in the good way) and quite depressing job. The culture whereby you feel that you are constantly being watched, does not give you the happy vibes either. Unfortunately, I didn't see that there were career prospects outside of Analytics and by that stage I was so disillusioned with the company that I simply decided to look elsewhere."
"2812","Make very, very sure that potential employees know exactly what the Analytics role entails before hiring them. It does not involves actual analytics but is a helpdesk. Plain and simple.

We call Bloomberg, BB and therefore Big Brother, you are monitored in and out of the building, the security guards ensure you swipe the card... as this shows up on the Bloomberg terminal (the OS) as to whether you are on site or not, not really a grown up way to operate.  Your manager will always know your whereabouts.  Seems untrusting.
There are some lovely teams who are made up of some seriously talented and experienced people ie the philanthropy group, the event teams, sales teams and the art group because of the nice people involved but as with every firm there are teams that are not so pleasant.
Given it's privately run status, the approach to marketing and sales seems to be very traditional and really run out of the US... with little understanding of how different Europe can be and the needs of sales.

There are fantastic databases and email clients out there, but Bloomberg employees are instead stuck using some... guy's afterthought side project instead of those functional outside products. It's a serious drain on productivity. Also, the process to move code to beta and production is extremely draconian and micro-managed. In any other company, I could accomplish in two weeks what it took me two months to do at Bloomberg.

"2999","Senior management has problems following through with commitments."
"3000","no defined career path or structure for progressions, nepotistic and extremely hierarchical management structure, repetitive and mindless work. Global Data employs data inputters yet calls them analysts, learning is very limited after initial training, the review process is based on manager ""impressions"" and deliberately vague, lots of under-motivated unintelligent people doing drudge work makes for a depression... environment"

"3015","La filosofia è molto nello stile di Wall Street, in che significa lunghe e intense ore lavorative e la supposizione che non si smetta davvero mai di lavorare (beh solo UN PO' quando si è in vacanza). C'è anche un'eccessiva attenzione in termini di agenzia di informazione su quello che i clienti principali (per esempio le banche) vogliono leggere piuttosto che un più ampio spettro di notizie. Quindi a volte la... priorità sembra piuttosto assurda."
"3016","Abbiate almeno UN PO' di riguardo per le condizioni locali dei giornalisti. E non pensate di aver perfezionato ogni pezzo: molto spesso gli articoli sembrano stati scritti da una squadra di robot."
"3017","Some Cons that I faced:
- Sometimes it can become difficult to convince students majoring in areas other than business to take the BAT.
- There is a minimum of candidates required to have a session, which in some small campuses can become quite challenging to reach."
"3018","Overall great work."
"3019","Not good in adopting latest tech."
"3020","When the benefits and colleagues are the high point of your day, something is wrong with the work.
With the exception of a few groups, chances are you will be working on an ancient software stack where the focus is to do a paint job and ship features as soon as possible. Not only is R&D management aware of this, the senior most managers actively evangelize paint jobs and to leave the rotting guts alone. This goes... against every engineer's basic instincts. Industry standard software practices such as unit testing, high availability, integration testing, quality control are verbally supported but not practically espoused in the over-arching Time-To-Market company motto. 
As an engineer, if you make peace with the fact that this is not a software company or a tech company by a long shot, you will be happy. Unfortunately, that also means that your skills deteriorate over time and with my shift to a startup I had to face an exceedingly steep learning curve. 
With all the myth propagated by management that compensation is top-notch, it is not. It is above average but not in the league of software companies offering equity. I left to join a small startup and got pretty much what I was making and some(equity). 
Hmmm management .... need I say more? All the reviews talk of terrible management and it is true. As an engineer you will not be treated as a professional, but as an untrustworthy resource that needs to be constantly monitored. This is reflected in their recent inability to hire engineers to fill open positions."
"3021","None. Management is made up of old-school finance types who are quite insular. Moreover, the company is still insanely profitable, ergo the thinking goes management must be doing something right and they really don't need any advice."
"3022","Many in the management hierarchy have never worked elsewhere in tech; this leads to a bit of one-dimensional outlook on how things should be done, how employees should be treated and how they should behave.  Also, there is a tendency to under-react to accomplishments and over-react to mistakes."
"3023","Be more expressive about employee accomplishments and demonstrate trust in employees."
"3024","You are generally expected to do whatever the company needs at the time, which makes for depressing career prospects if you don't love sales and the prospect of moving around (including to regional offices). 

Though the company as a whole has a good vibe, there are some areas that are absolutely terrible. London ADSK was easily the worst experience of my working career. Even though you're not expected to stay in... that kind of help desk role forever, when your only out is basically sales (another department that leaves a lot to be desired) you don't have much choice but to take advantage of the unlimited snacks, strict 8-6 hours and switch off after work and look for another job."
"3025","Having a flat corporate structure is great, but moving every manager around all the time means that they all feel they need to make their mark on their new department and simply make changes for the sake of change. Consider adding some checks and balances for this kind of behaviour, or at least give them some more support from more experienced managers when the person making the new changes may not necessarily... understand the ramifications of their actions."
"3026","Long hours, for a account manager to work 8-6 plus travel, this is rather demanding. There is also very little to no growth despite how they will change titles of employees every 6 months. Just look around, all the senior folks have been there 20+ years and are going no where. The chances of one getting a decent position to move from Account Management to somewhere else are non-existent."
"3027","Your salary growth for top performers is just terrible. Stop treating everyone like this is a union job where you trade so called security for no chance to move."
"3028","Your experience can vary a great deal depending on the skills and leadership of your manager. Their is high turnover in the Sales and Analytics program and generally morale is low. It is easy to feel replaceable covering a sell side bank and your input does little to impact client decisions."
"3029","Good for starting your career but not much upward potential."
"3030","The company expects a strong work ethic from their employees, and the workload can be heavy at times."
"3031","loose working environment for general employees"
"3032","hitting a plateau happens after max 1 year . Unless you are looking to get to very high ranks of management, flat hierarchy does not promote career progression. Payment quite mediocre for the amount of work required. Not a great work /life balance , very strict with time in/time out."
"3033","reward the hard workers"
"3034","Lots of old legacy code to deal with and use of proprietary API.  No privacy and no cubicles at all. Everything is an open area like a trader.  Hard to concentrate when you hear and see everything.  Too much politics."
"3035","Get rid of current management and start anew."
"3036","A significant amount of time is spent on doing the same task over and over again.  It limits the time you can actually work on meaningful or challenging products and can become boring and mundane.  The majority of roles in the company are centered on data ENTRY rather than data ANALYSIS as they lead you to believe.  There are many brilliant people in this company with advanced degrees and designations such as MBAs... and CFAs, yet they still do the same mundane tasks as others just starting at the company....ENTERING data....a task that could be completed by someone with a high school diploma. Nonetheless, the pay does consistently increase as you stay with the firm and there is significant opportunity to advance to managerial roles within your first 4-7 years with the firm."
"3037","Managers have no idea how to develop and coach their direct reports. The company is only now beginning to use 180-degree feedback in the evaluation process. Too many people have worked there for too long and know nothing other than Bloomberg, thus have few ways of learning, growing, seeing how high-performing organizations really work."
"3038","Hire some outsiders. Don't make your best reporters into managers. Pay attention to complaints of bullying."
"3039","job becomes boring after 2 yrs"
"3040","No Cons for this company"
"3041","Ridiculously underpaid for the amount of work demanded, micro-managed, not opportunities to grow and change team"
"3042","respect your employees"
"3043","no career growth, every team working on 2 -3 functions, people's knowledge of finance is limited in small area, so it will be very hard to get job from other finance company like investment bank, hedge fund  if you stay in Bloomberg for too long time.
The tech Bloomberg use is very old, it's extremely difficult to find a job in high tech company if you stay in Bloomberg for more than 3 years."
"3044","less politic battles focus on product development.
Hire people who can coding not those who know talking more than coding."
"3045","- Salaries are generally low and tailored to the type of people they hire ie, not very experienced. Staff turnover is quite high as most people leave after 2-3 year stints in the company.
- The business has essentially stalled since its acquisition by Bloomberg in late 2009 owing to a very difficult environment (oversupplied European carbon market, focus away from climate change issues, etc). Don't expect great pay... rises every year.
- BNEF is sometimes biased about low carbon energy and keeps talking up the market - not always justified in my view. A lot of ""predictions"" for carbon price that we made over the years have proven wildly wrong."
"3046","- There is a incredible amount of legacy code. Much is old fortran and C.
- Steep learning curve.
- You'll be capped at four weeks off. I'm not certain, but I think the whole company gets 4 weeks off.
- The high talent level, means if you are looking to be a manager, it'll take a while."
"3047","Continue to invest in developer productivity and training. At least within my team, there is always more work to be done then could ever get done. Our project management and bug tracking systems could really use some TLC. Also, we build software like complete amateurs, we should invest in better build management tools. We could also use better automated testing frameworks and facilities. Improvements are being made,... it would just be nice to have a greater emphasis placed on unit and acceptance testing."
"3048","No titles or much room for growth"
"3049","Be fair with all your employees and not just your favorites"
"3050","No personal growth, very constricted on what to do next"
"3051","Their way or nothing. Nothing can be achieved by being creative"
"3052","No Cons, I had to leave bc of relocation. This is a great company to work for."
"3053","Keep doing what your doing."
"3054","Less team work and more individual works. There are no bonding between the team. Just come, work and go.
Not much of career growth potential within this department."
"3055","Talk with the team members with open minded perspective. And try to understand the situation of the his/her's. There are no honest moment between manager and the team."
"3056","Be assured that you won't be doing anything advanced in terms of programming. They focus on pushing out the product ASAP. Now customers thinks, wow that's fast.
Then, when something breaks(because of poor design, no unit test, they hire people who doesn't know how to write proper OOP code etc. etc.) then we apply quick hacky fix. Then client thinks, wow, what a customer service!

This is basically why they're NOT... changing, there's no business reason to change. 

If you are a good programmer, you will find better paying company and better environment to learn. 

Now they are having trouble hiring people, they even changed the policy regarding hiring past employees. (It used to be if you quit, you can never come back.) Also, it used to be that you have to pass 80% grade in their training class upon hiring, otherwise you get fired. Now.. there's no such thing, because they can't afford to lose more people. The standard has definitely gone down.

I would definitely not recommend this company to my programmer friends. I know at least 5 people who are actively preparing for job interviews. These are the better programmers in R&D as well.
I also know many people are there just waiting for the green card, once they get, it, they say they'll get out of here ASAP.

I should not have chosen Bloomberg the first place, I regret it. 
Their HR response was the fastest among the companies I applied to, that was the only reason I chose it because it was the first offer I got. I rejected subsequent (at least better in terms of pay) offers from other companies all because I already accepted the offer from Bloomberg. 
Time you interviews right, don't make the same mistake!

I only stayed as long as I have because my green card is almost here. I will quit the day I get it. Too many better opportunities out there. There's more to life than trivial DRQS's."
"3057","please stop misleading interviewees, tell them the truth upfront. They will quit anyways after finding out how this is a business oriented company, not an IT firm by any stretch of imagination.
Also, if you look at this statistic: attrition rate of the employees who go the highest annual review VS. attrition rate of the employees in general, I bet you will find that the high perform employees tend to quit after a... few year. I've seen so many such cases."
"3058","no longer a growth organization
lack of perspective around flexibility 
outdated user interface"
"3059","lose your middle managers"
"3060","Bad managers.  Systems are redundant so that you are required to input same information over and over into different places.  Management is focused on trivial things instead of important things like revenue, happy clients, etc. Management is incapable of managing different personalities and expects everybody to conform to their perceived Bloomberg mold.  They make sure to underpay and overwork employees."
"3061","Learn to manage different personalities that can contribute ideas.  Learn to respect your employees.  Practice what you preach in ethics.  Focus on things that are important in business and set reasonable goals for your employees instead of unattainable ones."
"3062","The technology is dated, the purpose of your work limited.  As an employee of the r&d team chances are all you will be doing is executing ideas from the business manager with little input."
"3063","Promotions appear to be from tenure not from ability.  Outdated software means employees eventually realize the skills they are learning won't easily translate into a new company, so you are faced with the decision of becoming a lifer or moving on."

-  Most days involve sitting on a chair in front of 4 screens for 8- 9 hours a day and chatting with 3 -4 clients at a time helping them troubleshoot excel, giving out names of pages they can look for information 
- you are evaluated  by how fast you answer questions, how many phone calls you make etc 
- your team managers rarely answer client chats... themselves  but are responsible for making sure you do as much as possible in the assigned time so many employees in this department can end up feel like burnt out machines
- Some days can be very demanding/ draining with no breaks in between
- due to nature of the job you will be told which hour to eat lunch and will need to ask permission to schedule time spent doing anything else but answering chats and phone calls ( example projects) 
- there is constant monitoring of everything you do 
- The skills you learn are only specific to bloomberg 
- You will most likely stay in this position on help desk(analytics)  between 1.5 upto 3 YRS then the most common career path is sales 
- turnover rate is quite high as many people do not realize exactly what the job involves when they sign up
- Low morale in this department"

"3075","Lack of good managers in middle management. Almost all managers are home grown and as a result are sheltered from the outside world and lack the relevant market experience."
"3076","Loosen up rehire policy so that ex-employees who are interested in coming back to work are given the opportunity to do so. This group of ex-employees might just bring in invaluable market experiences and a new perspective of how things should be done."
"3077","Long hours, lack of career advancement opportunities."
"3078","Culture of fear, limited career growth in news, very very little direction for new/young employees who are learning the ropes (there's intense training, but it's training on company policies and style rather than how to succeed and become better at reporting/writing). The middle 50% of the company is a machine that falls often defers to the status quote rather than innovating and trying new things"
"3079","As Bloomberg's traditional business model of selling terminals shrinks, it's being forced to invest in enterprise services. Most of the employees don't have an enterprise services background and that's leading to some tension. Many of the mid-level managers shun innovation in exchange for an easy life. The fixed hours and protocols encourage a lot of wasteful micro-management."
"3080","Change the culture of the mid-level managers. Remove the protocols, lose the fixed hours regime and do much more to encourage innovation and career development."
"3081","Some teams are decidedly better than others, ranging from a bunch of very competent folks that would do well almost anywhere, to other teams which seem to be what's left after years of the cream of the crop skimming off to other places.  You are not allowed to actively trade, and moonlight coding for open source projects is if not discouraged, at least made quite tedious and difficult."
"3082","Spend a little less time making internal videos and producing new internal ""awards"", and spend a little more time regularly chatting with every employee outside of the lines of reporting."
"3083","Very long working hours, speed"
"3084","It is ultimately a US company so most decisions are still made from the US. Voices from regions do get heard but it takes much longer for the senior management to notice and make changes. 
APAC works 1 hour more than US and EMEA. Claimed to be due to business needs but this doesn't make sense as we should be following the market opening and closing hours!
Managers are most home-grown. They do lack exposure and... experience thus making wrong / silly decisions at times."
"3085","Rehire should be considered. These are the people who may just need some market exposure and when they are back, they can definitely see what we lack and improve to stay competitive."
"3086","Internal communication can be lacking, to the detriment of the finished product. And in the end, more loyal to the product than to the people who could make it better if only they heard more than silence from above. Also, the culture is rigid, rigid, rigid."
"3087","Talk more to your underlings. Don't just expect them to puzzle out the mystery box on their own."

Really poor management, team leader doesn't care about what you achieve there; high turnover becuz of the disappointment; the culture is a little too bluffing and social, you can always find ppl chill around or chatting through IB all day, so the working... environment is not encouraging."
"3091","Lack of Communication from manager"

"3105","Very low salary compared to other companies in the financial sector, while bonuses are also capped and quite low (at least at the beginning). Very mediocre middle management, with promotions based on connections and time spent at the company (not always, but very often).

I found (and not all the time but alot) that people from the market also look down on you and you're seen as the... ""bloomberg guy"" which is great if you want to just be the bloomberg guy and talk only about bloomberg but if not, then not so great. Oh and when it comes to ratings they can really screw you as its all about whether they like you or not and not really about sales - they have to rate on a curve so if you dont know who in your team will get a shi&t rating, then its you..."

"3175","- Management culture is cult-like, holding loyalty, blood and sweat over real talent and wisdom
- Power struggles at the highest levels of the company (most importantly between the CEO and the head of product) tend to have a bigger role in business decisions than actual business
- At least a dozen ""lifers"", who would be utterly unemployable anywhere else, but are worshiped for blood spilled over projects past,... hang around in cushy on-the-job retirement positions, billing the company anywhere from $400K-$1.2M annually for jobs that are generally manufactured and pointless (""head of regional businesses"", ""chief PVF officer"")
- Core technology stack is so massive and yet painfully old that attempting to modernize it is an asymptotic goal. The great technical genius behind Bloomberg 2, what was supposed to be the future of the company (but will never actually ship), was a plan to move to the latest generation of Windows foundation libraries. Windows in 2012! Recruiting and PR will tell you that Bloomberg is using anything that sounds new and cool and all up in that web stuff. Somewhere, someone is doing that, yes. You won't. If you work in R&D, and if you want to succeed and earn the trust and respect of your peers, you will work on C, maybe some C++, and you will at least see Fortran if not change it. And it won't be good C code. It will be the kind of C code that reads ""int one = 2;"", written by unskilled recent college graduates that were mentored by managers with history majors.
- Uncle Mike's money spigot runs so fast and hard that managers on the product side are rarely held accountable for failures. With 85% of your revenue coming from a single, huge product sold on a flat price model, how do you measure success? The answer always ends up being some bogus metrics, which the good managers will figure out how to juke and/or just magically explain away while proposing next year's bigger, even more expensive plan, that will not only correct the mistakes of last year's plan but also introduce MORE, GLORIOUS MISTAKES.
- Severe violation of personal space, this culture has decided that your acceptance is conditional upon their complete and total ownership of your being. Even the most minute discrepancies in your schedule must be reported (publicly) and explained away; all work is logged and diced into spreadsheets put under constant scrutiny; all tickets (and there are zillions of them) go through piles and piles of approvals and re-routing; transparency is taken to an extreme that is disrespectful and psychologically abusive at times."
"3176","- Stop sinking zillions of dollars into non-terminal products nobody wants you to make. It doesn't matter how amazing you think the opportunity is, you are not Elon Musk. Thus far every single business you've tried to build outside of the terminal has failed, sometimes gloriously. Just stop. The terminal is what you're good at, and that is nothing to be ashamed of.
- You are not going to make money in multimedia,... but you should keep doing it because multimedia is really part of news, and you need to keep doing news. But stop expecting profit.
- Stop promoting cronies and loyalists that didn't earn the position on merit. Not all lifers are bad, and there are definitely some impressive people that have settled into senior positions. But the reason you have to keep shuffling around all these upper managers across product/data/R&D is because these people were promoted for the wrong reasons. Get them out of the chain of command and promote the people that are doing the actual work.
- Stop being so arbitrarily cheap. You see some greedy village idiot from R&D shoving dozens of cans of tuna into his gym bag and it boils your blood. Fine, but lecturing the entire population on moderation and respect just takes the glow off the gesture of free food in the first place, without saving you a significant dime. Give the animals what they want, let the free food spigot flow and party like you're Google in 2014. God knows you could afford it if you just fired one useless crony. It shouldn't be too hard. Put them on a performance plan, set goals for anything that is of material value to you, and then document when they fail to achieve those goals. If a 22-year old Team Lead from R&D can do it, so can you."
"3177","Limited growth potential. Team Leaders & Mangers do very little to encourage individual growth. Far too great an emphasis on individual metrics, rather than long-term growth with company."

For engineers who have been in the workforce for more than five years, it is a very bad proposition to stay at Bloomberg for too long.   The compensation increases eventually are very incremental and are below market... compared to other technology companies that offer equity.

If you... want to do well, never say what you mean and never mean what you say.

For a technology company I found it humorous that everything, even the internal CRM, is based on a terminal environment that looks like it is from an Apple IIe. Horrible internal tech.
Workaholics, mostly younger environment. I... suppose this is typical NYC style but work is everything. And everything is designed to monitor you and keep you working as much as possible for as long as possible. Many managers abuse the ability to keep tabs on people.

"3232","Hesitating to call work-life balance a joke at Bloomberg, but only because it's not funny how terrible it is. Of the four weeks of vacation you're given, expect to take about half of that, if you're lucky – and if you don't answer e-mails while you're gone, be prepared to hear about it when you get back. Every action at this company – in the News division, those are few and far between – is preceded by approximately... 50 meetings wherein the same talking points are hashed out by the same people without any results. 

In the News division, expect to make 50-60 percent what you would at a competing venture for twice the work. For lower level positions in particular, the attrition rate is astonishingly high – I was the fourth person to hold my position and leave after less than a year. Like my three predecessors, I burned out from the unreasonably workload – we're talking sleeping at desks – combined with an outrageously undermarket salary."
"3233","I'll quote what my HR representative said to me in my exit interview: Sell your fishtanks and pay your employees what the market would pay them."

Very competitive, hard to get an exceeds expectations. Proprietary tech, at times too fast paced, steeper learning curve"
"3235","Shuffle people less and let them build themselves in a role with time"
"3236","Everything else. Does no one else find it odd that all of the reviews written by supposed software developers (the majority of which are non-native English speakers at BBG) tend to be written in perfect English, using American slang, and are all written using the same tone of voice? Does anyone else notice that if there are bad reviews posted, suddenly all the new good reviews, say the exact opposite of what the bad... reviews said word for word? Odd. I'm sure we will get a slate of reviews that attempt to sound non-native now, courtesy of HR.

Anyhow. Where to begin.

Stanley Young: He was hired to be the next chief executive of technology at BBG back in 2013. He quit in less than one year. Why would that be? Possibly because top execs at BBG refuse to believe that the terminal is going down and may not even be relevant in less than a decade? We've got machine learning now, people. We've got start ups that give away the very same product as BBG charges 20K per terminal a year for. We've got predicative analytics. And guess what. These start ups have a way better user interface, are easier to use, and more modern. The only reason people pay for BBG is for the IM feature. But guess what, there are competitors building better ones.

Incompetence abounds: I have had several incompetent leaders. Rather than replace them, or demote them, they are usually assigned a baby sitter who then makes sure they do their job correctly. Because no one at BBG can ever admit they made a mistake. Sometimes I feel the leads there would rather knowingly make a mistake than admit they are wrong. Odd for a company that has based its entire reputation on quality and preciseness of data to their customers.

The spying: not only did BBG get caught for spying on their customers, it is known that they track everything their employees do. I am sure they can write a report on how much time I spend in the bathroom, if they wanted to. Nobody is ever told what they do with these metrics, though. And you have no idea what you are being measured on, or by whom, or even why. It totally makes you paranoid. Who is watching me and why? It's like the NSA. They should read you your Miranda rights before working there because anything you say will be used against you.

Evaluation: Since everything about you is evaluated, you will look forward to your annual review where every tiny, petty little detail will be brought up and used as ammunition against giving you a raise. Were you late that one day? Look for it in your review! Did you dare question someone's incorrect opinion? You will see it right there in your review!

Workload: Team leads don't lead or work. They just spy on you and tattle to the boss. That's it.

Advancement: I have never seen any member of my team change roles, although they say you can after 18 months."
"3237","None."
"3238","Hours, management, office politics. My manager told me in order to get better metrics I need to be a great short distance runner and a long distance runner. My reply was.. well I wonder why they have two different categories in the Olympics..."

"3251","Lower management has a lot of power and autonomy at Bloomberg and if for whatever reason (personal, racial, or maybe your higher level of education than theirs, etc.) they are not supportive of you, they can make a lot of unfair decisions regarding your pay and green card application. Most people have bachelor's or master's degrees at Bloomberg and sometimes older employees view newer people with higher degrees as... threats to their careers due to its flat structure. So, I actually don't recommend Bloomberg if you have a higher education degree."
"3252","Upper management should be more involved in important decisions that directly affect employee satisfaction from the company such as pay, bonuses and immigration decisions."
"3253","-A lot of the technology is proprietary or old, making transitioning in or out of the company difficult. New technologies do show up, but it takes time, requires political navigation, and rarely has coverage across the whole company
-Business managers often push back when developers try to invest in stability or code cleanup, which is obviously bad in the long-term"
"3254","R&D management should continue to push upper management to respect investment in stability and good practice, and the recent push for increased participation in the open-source community should be fast-tracked. In my 3 years at the company, we have gone from having very little standing among the tech community for young people to being a nascent player, and we should continue that push."
"3255","I worked here for many years, and wanted this to be the company I'd really turn into my lifetime career.  The office is amazing with their free snacks and tons of perks, but after a while you realize its all there because everything else associated with working there is LITERALLY miserable.  They give you great vacation time (4 weeks to start), but trust me you will need every single day of those 4 weeks just to... avoid ending up in a padded room in a mental institution.  I made some amazing friends here, but there are SO many people who are honestly clueless about how to manage people and/or how to interact with clients.  For every action taken there are 52 internal meetings and 15 procedures that are old and do not work.  You will spend half of your energy fighting internal battles just to get a YES or NO answer.  Unless you literally want to use this as a ""stepping stone"", are looking for something to beef up your resume for a year, or if you have no interpersonal skills and can't find any other job - then stay away."

"3264","it would be nice to raise the hiring bar"

"3266","Knowing the employee turnover and general opinions of employees (that you hear in the office), I don't understand who writes these 4-5 star reviews? Bloomberg HR maybe? My recollection is that pretty much everybody plans on leaving when the first opportunity comes, as the company is rotten to the core. The managers are either young pets, who are brown nosing the seniors, or mediocre ""Tony Middle Level Manager""s, who... have stayed at Bloomberg since 1986, as they are too incompetent to get a job anywhere else. 

In London, the turnover is the highest, and in Princeton some people stay longer as they are less other opportunities around. Bloomberg is not the first choice for anybody! People work at Bloomberg only because they have to."
"3267","Employees are not a commodity. Do to high turnover, many of your employees go to work for your clients. This makes your sales efforts very difficult, as your former employees don't want to see a terminal on their desks for a justified reason."

- Department as a whole is only concerned with work by stats/numbers. No real understanding or appreciation of staff effort... if their stats aren't 100% perfect.
- Too much pressure to live up to company's 'reputation' standards. Staff are underpaid and overworked.
- Department very reluctant to let anyone have any time off due to language cover. You will often have to book your time off several months in advance, and if you call in sick, TLs will harass and hound you until you come back into work.

"3281","The software environment is both challenging and very peculiar to the company, though.  And a lot of it is legacy, which means having to work within a set of constraints (binary compatibility with 1990s Fortran code, code relocatibility, proprietary routines) which I can pretty much guarantee you will not find anywhere else.  And because of those constraints, moving code thru to production is a major pain.  On some... particularly central class I was tasked to optimize, my changes took 6 months to percolate thru to production environment.

The bureaucracy is also sclerotic.  Having to document your working hours and bill it to various tickets (development, bug fixes, etc.) gets quickly tiring, and meaningless, as the fudge factor for accounting for 8 hrs day makes charging completely arbitrary.  Getting a TREQ (technical request for new projects) can be a pain.  All this is done thru the Bloomberg terminal which means there is nowhere to hide: your boss (but also pretty much anyone in the company) can find out about all the commands you typed during the day.  The terminal has quirks too and I can't count how many times I lost a long typed message because of a wrong key stroke.

But the reason I eventually left is that once you're in, the possibilities for raising your salary are limited.  You will do well to negotiate the highest you can on entry, it's unlikely to rise significantly after that.  Your first year bonus is invested/amanged by the company into internal stock (BB is private) and you only see it in your bank account after the end of the second year (with moderate interests).  The value of the internal stock can be tracked using another Bloomberg terminal function, so at least it's transparent.  That means of course when you leave they get to keep your current year bonus - the one they are still ""managing"" for you.  This is described by the employer as an incentive for you to invest in the company.  The longer you stay, the better.  Unfortunately, it makes leaving that much more painful.

Much of the work is tedious and menial, there's a fanatical dedication to proprietary tools and... methods (which as an experienced senior hire I really wasn't impressed by), no project management, poor planning.  It's a stifling, oppressive place that cripples all their best, most creative people.  R&D is a massive sweatshop that relies on an constant stream of incoming H1Bs and fresh college grads they can get to before they learn anything that might make them attractive to another company.  All in all I'd say that if you're an experienced programmer with skills in legacy systems, or a recent college grad that can't find work, or you need the stability and benefits to support your family then it might be worth it."
"3291","Reconnect with some of the people developing your product, there are some really talented people there but your own polices and practices make it impossible to get real results.

The Terminal's email is its most-used function, yet it introduced Rich Text (you know, the ability to... bold and underline words) only in 2012! And the net installations of those Terminals determines almost 50% of your annual bonus. The company has dealt with numerous sexual harrassment allegations, and the stories of managers yelling at employees and even throwing phones at them are legendary. That culture continues at the company, with numerous managers incompetent at their job but who are excellent at bullying employees and treating everything as an immediate emergency. Finally, keeping with their 1980s mentality, they don't let you work from home, even when half the subway lines stop running because of a blizzard. You'll get a call from the manager (who lives 3 blocks away) wondering why you're not at work yet."

There are a number of managers who earned and build their little power empires in the last 2 decades, and who are clinging on to both their power and their old ways. Avoid these trolls of the 90s at all costs! While... Bloomberg is very loyal to its employees, the downside is that these 'bad' managers and their little power tribes are not removed as they should be. THEY ARE PARASITES. If you are skilled and smart, you will learn how to avoid the bad manager vortex. 

The 2nd down is the occasional suffocating bureaucracy. Annual planning and budgeting is not unlike a 3 month ongoing water-boarding experience that has killed many a great business idea. JUST SAY NO to any such bureaucracy! (trust me, you';ll be fine refusing to participate, secretly most management HATES the process, and they'll silently will approve your insubordination)

"3372","Rather pointless"
"3373","1. Personality cult - Mike Bloomberg is a demi-god in there.. Doctoroff, present CEO tries to steer the company the same way MB did.
2. No need for your input - just do your job. All decisions are centralized and structure is anything but flat.

4. If you're thinking about their grad scheme - the ""Sales and Analytics"" programme - don't do it. For the next 1.5-2 years you will be stuck in a Bloomberg helpdesk taking 4-8 questions at the same time. These can be anything from pointing a client to a button to answering a pricing question. I've seen 50% of a graduate intake QUIT in the middle of the training! NEVER, EVER have I seen this at any other company.
5. Company is split 50/50 between juniors and dinosaurs, you either join and leave quickly or you stay for ages.. Very few people have spent 3-5 years there. Most of them bail within 2 years or you stay for 10, 15 or 25.
6. Work is minimum 10h per day for ALL employees. If you're in sales like I was you will do more frequently. Pay does not match proper financial companies so effectively you do not get compensated for that.
7. Few manage to jump into a decent bank or financial institution. Look this up on LinkedIn yourself: most of ex-Bloomberg staff end up with other vendors (such as Thomson Reuters) or go into never-heard-of small brokerages.
8. All work at Bloomberg revolves around one product - the terminal. All side products are based on the presence of the terminal. This means the company does not need YOU, it needs you to do your work so the product can get better. There is little point in investing a lot in their staff."

"3416","Management is ancient - their ideas are from the 80s which is  when most of them got to the roles they've stayed in ever since. Standard working hours are 8-6 which is too long given the salary. Expectation is for even longer hours but pointless given lack of available opportunities for advancement and poor bonus for this extra effort. Most people who've been at the company through one annual review realise this and... stop. The problem is the turnaround is so high that the new starters all put in much more hours and the process starts over again...."
"3417","Sack more managers, the ones that are good enough to stay need more training. Can't have so many people with poor qualifications, under the age of 26 managing teams.

They are obsessed with shrouding their incompetence with 'culture' and fallacy. I left because management were very inconsistent. I couldn't handle the idea of creating a long term career under people I couldn't trust. 

At first I tried applying for jobs internally as I was convinced the problems were only in my office. I don't now believe that's the case. I... liken bloomberg to an apple rotting away slowly from the inside, you won't see the issues until its far too late.

If you want career development at a smaller office, concentrate on making friends and never disagreeing with your immediate manager, even if they aren't making sense. The key is to appear busy/swamped and then make excuses after the fact as to why something turned out the way it did. The managers I've encountered have no concept of strategy, it's generally accepted that they should plan better (read: say they will plan better) and then do exactly the same thing that blew up in their faces time and time again.

All management at bloomberg should have a mandatory dictionary on their desks. They all seem a little confused what different words mean. They have analysts that aren't analysts, advocates that aren't advocates, office managers who don't take care of the office... The list goes on and on. 

Also, count on a management reshuffle that has absolutely no effect on the business every 6 months or so. This will be explained to you at some point, but about 10 minutes later you'll realise they spoke for 20 mins without actually saying anything specific."

"3446","Weak management. Very cliquey, Bloomberg claims to be a transparent company but nothing is further from the truth. People are very independent just worrying about their own backs careers. There is no management support all they seem to focus on is sucking up to senior managers for their own personal gains. You are not treated with any kind of respect just a commodity. The whole structure of the company breeds... disloyalty mistrust and low morale. I would not advise anyone to take up a career at bloomberg it DOESNT do what it says on the tin. The only benefit i came away with was that it looks good on my CV  period !"

"3455","Remembering our roots as we get huge and global. The Bloomberg Way *is* a real thing.

-Lots of senior employees get transferred to an undesirable department (usually entry level like GTEC or GCUS) to get the senior employees to quit rather than fire them.
-Newer employees (3 years experience) often chosen for management roles over senior employees (7-15 years). It seems like once the new guys get more chances than the established veterans.
-It is very hard to advance in the company management unless someone likes you. The same people in middle management get rotated around to new roles and its hard to break in."
"3484","Bloomberg used to be a meritocracy. Work hard & you were rewarded. Meritocracy died when ""certain people"" took over and embraced metrics. Metrics are good to weed out the good from the bad, but you aren't rewarding employees who are going above the call of duty. Bloomberg paid for top level talent, paying more than the average company for above average talent. What happened to that philosophy? Allow team leaders... more flexibility in rewarding those employees that are working their butts off - and when raises are below 3% you aren't going to get employees motivated to work more than they are expected."

Just as the company was establishing itself to reach that goal, new management was brought in, the company footprint was reduced to...

Management systems are outdated and uninspiring. Almost everyone I work with is miserable and either feel trapped due to needing job... stability or are counting down the days until they quit. I have never seen a workplace with such low morale and fear. HR and upper management try and get the most amount of work out of you while paying you the least amount possible.

On top of that, the Head of the department seemed not to care about these circumstances as well. The whole structure of the company is a charade.

People sometimes get shuffled round against their will into different teams.  Your experience in a team can depend a lot on the luck of who your manager is.  Some managers are great, others get put into managerial positions because they were good programmers but don't necessarily have any people skills.
Review process is somewhat opaque....
Atmosphere on development floor is very quiet - you may find this a plus, I found that it doesn't give a strong sense of belonging to a team as most people are working independently.  This can also lead to disjointed projects.
Most programming teams have their own business department, so if you like interacting with clients on the creative side of coming up with a new product then you might find your opportunity to be involved in this a bit limited."

"3625","Bloomberg has a great atmosphere with free food, cool office decor, expensive summer parties and occasionally free catered food in the office.  Though this was great, and despite having excellent benefits and 401k package, the base salary was very average (for analytics).  I think they try to convince you are getting a great deal with the environment that you forget there are other jobs out there that have a better... pay package.  The bonus is pretty small relative to other firms as well.   It's a great place to get experience and learn about fundamental finance, however."
"3626","Most management is good.  When a staff member asks a question, help them find the answer rather than question why they are asking anything in the first place.  Makes it difficult to ask questions."
"3627","Unfortunately when you get into the actual substance of this company an that's your job, there is a lot left to be desired.  There is absolutely no career path at this company. They have an internal job board which they have recently promoted and made a big deal of but it does not help if the hiring managers are all on different agendas.  It is very difficult for an employee to come to the company and create a PATH... because most of the hiring managers are not looking to build and develop skills in employees. They instead want outside experience for intermediate type roles to better build products.  They want to take knowledge instead of invest skills back into their own people. What that leaves younger employees with is a career that includes jumps around to numerous entry-level type positions or a career in sales.  Those that recognize this are still left stuck as the skills they develop at Bloomberg don't necessarily translate to marketable skills in finance (learning how to input a DRQS is not marketable).

My advice - if you are at all ambitious and want to develop a consistent career path, do not come to this company.  Run, don't walk to that other opportunity if you can help it."
"3628","Encourage managers and departments to work together to build a career path for your employees.  Jumping to different entry level roles is NOT a path.

Create an environment where the smart employees can develop a skill-set that is marketable.  This will actually encourage them to stay longer, as they are feeling challenged while knowing what they are doing is not actually hurting their chances of getting another... job one day.  Feel proud that you developed talent instead of afraid they will leave (the smart unchallenged employee will always find a way to leave)."

Again, this shouldn't be a con, but if you are young and naive, you might find this... also to be distasteful. 

The only really big con is the annual review process, which is a curve-fitted algorithm to award future compensation based on relative (within your peer group) performance.

"3752","Any skill that you develop while working at Bloomberg as a software developer will be primarily, if not totally, useless to any company that you are looking to move to in the future.  Maybe some of the high level skills of debugging and problem solving may be of value but working on proprietary relational databases, proprietary web services, proprietary UI and development tools not to mention out dated programming... languages will get you nowhere fast.  How a company of this size thinks that they can develop a relational database that is better than say ""Oracle"" with their millions of man hours invested in their product suite is simply foolish to put it lightly.  This is a company that is so stuck in the past with their Fortran code still in use and their flagship product the ""Bloomberg Panel"" that looks like it was developed in the 1980's with its amber block character email system is just so unbelievable that a company would be so stuck in the past.  Their client base is strictly based on the amount of data they provide and clearly not on their innovation of modern software .  This a company where you have to fall in line with the management with decades of tenure that will do anything to keep the status quo and their job.  By adding layer upon layer of nonsense they can keep building their kingdoms of drones and promoting themselves and their software keeps living in the distant past.  It is also a place where big brother is watching you 24 hours a day.  Every email that you write is read by security, every phone call that you make is recorded, their are cameras and microphones everywhere.  You cannot leave the building unless you check out and security watches your every move.  The big brother attitude is unnecessary and you have to wonder how it really helps their bottom line.

* Management is generally inept and inefficient.  Employees' feedback is generally ignored.
* It's claimed that Bloomberg is transparent, but it's not the case.  As an employee you have very little idea of what's going on outside your area of responsibility or any say on important decisions that might affect you.

There is rarely team spirit even though one is... promoted. Each person is on his own. Bloomberg long ago became a big corporation in spirit and it acts and feels like one."
"3851","1. Insufficient performance incentives.  There is little or no recourse for underperforming, and little reward for doing well.  This is one of the reasons top talent and the best salespeople eventually leave.

2.  Middle management quality is mediocre.  Whilst there are a few good men and women here, a massive layer of middle managers who lack management skills and industry expertise are running the show (see cons... #1).  This is not the place to learn management best practice.

3.  Compromised customer focus.  Sales reps are bogged down by admin work half the time, leaving the other half to serve customers.  A ""don't rock the boat"" culture can be source of frustration when required product enhancements and individual incompetence are swept under the carpet.

4. Frequent re-organizations and reporting line changes (every six months?!).  With that much uncertainty in your job scope, not only are job titles and descriptions meaningless, career planning is meaningless when the link between job size and job performance is frequently broken.  Frequent change of reporting lines comes at a cost to teamwork and staff loyalty.

5.  Weak communication and co-ordination. For sales and product development staff, integrating data and functionality from multiple Bloomberg sources and getting staff from other departments who do not have shared incentives to move in unison pose challenges to their objectives.  For support staff, having inadequate warnings about product gaps and project delays means unproductive time wasted on managing client expectations.

To be fair, Bloomberg’s C-level management is aware of the high turnover of top employees and is trying to find out why.  HR is trying to address this issue with the recent launch of career development initiatives.   Unfortunately, there is little HR can do for mid-career professionals without a sincere buy-in from middle management to change the status quo (see above), since the 'management in cahoots' below the top holds the reins to the individuals' career progression anyhow."
"3852","Once a customer focused start-up formed by Michael Bloomberg, the company Bloomberg now resembles a large government-run monopoly resting on the laurels of growing market share and margins vs.Thomson Reuters.  Launching Bloomberg NEXT will give it a few more years of market leadership.

Long term, an organization is only as good as the quality of employees it can retain.  A number of the above-mentioned issues are... present in large organizations to a certain degree, but the lack of market discipline exacerbates these problems in Bloomberg.  Plan 10B is one step in the right direction to elevate staff performance, but more is needed to shakeup corporate culture.  As a first step, going public and paying employees with Bloomberg stock will force Bloomberg's senior management to write off non performing business segments, reduce unproductive deadwood, and align employee incentives to company P&L.

As a second step, it can consider merging its Data, QA, and R&D departments into one unit operating in US, Europe and Asia.  Include an audit trail, centralized approval of any code changes/fixes, thorough testing in each region, and up-to-date documentation to ensure proper integration of functionality and support across time zones.

These two will address the underlying problems and make the Michael Bloomberg brand something professionals are still proud to represent.  Finally, if Bloomberg is serious about expanding non terminal revenues in businesses where entry barriers are much lower, this may well be the only way ahead.

As a potential client, I sincerely wish Bloomberg well."

"3939","Although Bloomberg is a business that is solely owned by Michael Bloomberg, after Bloomberg left to become mayor of New York and entrusting the business to his partners and senior level executives, the management ran the company much like a publicly owned company which made it lose much of its charisma, luster, and appeal.  Prior to that, Bloomberg was very, well...""Bloomberg centric"", with a lot of internal... propaganda boasting the sheer genius of the CEO and president, complete with posters and books all over the office, much like what you would see in a stereo typical documentary of a communist country.  I personally didn't mind this so much, because the alternative was even more annoying.  Michael Bloomberg propaganda was replaced with sales propaganda and the entire office was forced to become very sales-centric, which for many departments outside of sales didn't make too much sense.


It is said that a career in Bloomberg is a ""Bloomberg Career"".  To clarify, what this means is that regardless of your previous experience, goals, skill set, etc, after you are hired, you can be moved into any department within Bloomberg at any time.  For example, you could be hired as a sales manager, but after a year, management may move you into Tech Support or into the Call Center as a call center operator, regardless of whether you can or want to do the job.   Although this is an extreme example of what could happen, it has happened before.  Hence, in many cases management does not care too much about your career nor take in consideration that this may not be a good move for you, but rather is focused on what they think is right.


Bonuses are fair (most of the time) but is highly dependent on sales performance.  The bonuses are paid  in the form of certificates or more commonly known as ""certs"".  Certs are given to you at the time of employment, and can fluctuate in value over the course of the year depending on the company's sales performance.  The good thing about this system is that you'll get a good idea how much your bonus will be. But the bad part is that unless you're a sales manager with the ability to make senior level decisions on sales initiatives, there is no way you can increase or control  the value of your certs.  All you can do is work hard and hope that your manager rewards you with more certs at your annual performance review, which will be paid the following year.

Base pay rarely changes (at least for me it didn't).  And based on talks with my colleagues, that seems to be consistent everywhere.  However, employees were rewarded (sometimes generously) with certs.  Some senior employees could have several hundred certs valued at anywhere from $300 to $1000+ per cert, depending on the sales performance for that year.  Furthermore, there seemed to be no apparent caps on the number of certs an employee is allowed to have.  So if you consistently get additional certs every year, your bonus can be considerably more than your base salary.  The biggest disadvantage is that even if you're not sales person, the bulk of your salary relies solely on performance of another individual or department.  Moreover, there are no guarantees that you'll be able to keep your certs.  A ""new"" manager who's trying to make budgetary cuts, can easily take them all away, which leaves very little incentive to work harder, or even stay with the company at all."
"3940","-Stop trying to grab so much attention and manage your departments more effectively

2. Pressure to meet bonuses can be stressful, but that's just part of the job and it motivates you to exceed it."
"3942","There should be more recognition given to the employees working in locations away from the headquarters. It may difficult for now since the world economy is so skewed toward the West but it would do management well to begin paying more attention to operations in Asia and EMEA when the world begins to tilt their way."
"3943","Each job rotation is too quick. Often management have little idea of how the actual market is like."
"3944","1) Career paths are almost non-existent, but senior management has been taking many steps over the last few months to fix this.  Needs to be seen how this plays out over the next few months.
2) Work experience depends on the team you are in.  Some of the teams are really great, but some of them are pretty bad too.
3) Politics.  The internal politics can be really bad (again, some teams are better than others).
4)... By and large, software practices range from poor to mediocre.  There are a few teams that are an exception to this (the infrastructure teams are really great, but product teams tend to be far more ""hack a fix, then worry about negative consequences later"". The infrastructure team, OTOH, use top notch software engineering practices).
5) The company is a weird mix of transparent, yet opaque.  There is a huge effort to appear transparent, but where most important decisions, even at the lowermost levels, are concerned, the decision making process is very opaque."

"3962","- Management favors certain subordinates over others due to personality traits, not ability to perform the job.
- Management focuses too much on time estimates & performance metric measurements, and too little focus on providing proper guidance to subordinates. Subordinates are often left in the dark on how to approach tasks correctly.
- Management often ignores subordinate accomplishments, and instead focuses on... their mistakes, using them as a verbal & written weapon in yearly reviews, resulting in managers looking good to their managers, while the subordinate is demoralized. Management is also poor on properly suggesting how to help a subordinate fix or resolve mistakes.
- Too much focus on code ""appearance"" policies, and not enough focus on testing the code people write. It is almost as if management wants programmers to release mistakes to customers so they can blame the programmer when something goes wrong.
- R&D Training at the time I was an employee was almost 3 months long, with much of the material not even relevant to the job itself you get once you're done with training. There is clearly some miscommunication between the Training Instructors and the Programmers.
- Skilled programmers are often ""promoted away"" from programming into management, even if they are not good at managing people.
- Business is too focused on short-term quarterly earnings and refuse to let programming teams invest time on projects that could improve the company over the long term.
- Programming teams within company are too isolated from each other with almost no inter-team communication and very little lateral movement between teams. Every team appears to be ""trying to do everything themselves"".
- Depending on which group you're in, you could be stuck with ""mundane code maintenance"" instead of the more interesting job of coding new or enhanced features in the company products.
- Too many proprietory technologies. If you work here for too long, then leave to work elsewhere, you often end up ""relearning"" equivalent technologies.
- Even if you get a good yearly review, your raise is typically lower than the increase in overall cost of living in the New York City area.
- One nice manager I had was ""banned from the floor"" of a different programming group for catching bugs in their product & bringing it to their attention. People shouldn't be punished for doing the right thing.
- Typical workspace environment is full of hundreds of people (with no walls or cubicles) and can get very noisy. 10 people chatting is no big deal, but 100 people chatting is distracting when you're trying to code & rushing to make a deadline. Be prepared to be most productive in the late hours, after most people gone home, or at the very least wear some headphones with music playing to tune them out.
- Managers and business groups peer-pressure employees during company parties to ""get in"" on their mentality and whatever activity they're up to. If you disagree with what they're doing due to ethical or religious reasons, or you ""don't get"" what they're up to, you are immediately made fun of and ostracized."
"3963","Management needs to properly motivate subordinates and help them improve, and focus less on emphasizing their mistakes and demoralizing them. Through habitual destructive criticisms, management successfully made me believe I was a bad programmer and a bad person. I was later surprised at the next company I worked in to learn that none of this is true. It took a lot of therapy to remove Bloomberg management's effect... on me. Also, the programming teams should cooperate a little more with each other, and this can reduce some of the inefficient redundancies.

4. Must use the Bloomberg terminal almost for everything, which makes me feel the clock has been turned back to 80's. 
5. Unprofessional/incompetent managers/team leaders. I would say many of them are more like foremen than managers. I suspect they don't feel very secure (because their Bloomberg ""management experience"" probably will be useless if they need to find another job), which makes their management even worse.

Even if you move into a new position, you don't get your new salary, so you can spend months working in a higher paying role, but the new salary doesn't kick in until the 1 year period. Also the long hours. The norm is to work 9/10 hour... days depending on what dept you are in, but if you are overloaded with work (which is pretty often) you're looking at 10 /11 hour days!

I just wish management knows what they want before handing me work, mostly because it's not easy always editing comprehensive reports just to change a few things, when the reports were designed for only specific metrics/data.

Once you are hired into a role (and are good at it), the common theme is that they will not promote you because they cannot backfill your role once you move up.

3) There is no loyalty to any... employee. They downsized a department recently and fired people that has been working with the company for 19 years without trying to accommodate them somehow (This happened in the London office).

Of course, always make sure you can leave if it doesn't work for you. I don't work there anymore, but I gave myself a year before composing this, so that I could be objective, and avoid looking vindictive.
With that, let me begin ...

#1 - Legacy code -- you must have... heard this term thrown about casually, or in the titles of books you might have passed by -- but you will be working with legacy code that could be 10 or 20 years old. Now thats not a bad thing in itself, except that a whole lot of it was written by incompetent people (more of this in #2). I see you're not sufficiently scared yet -- I have three words for you -- ""GUI in Fortran"" -- if that doesn't do it for you, go ahead and send in your resume, you'll love the place.

#2 - Incompetent people -- they're all over the place -- it could be your colleagues, your managers, sales people you interface with. Part of this, I think, has to do with the broken recruitment process - I won't necessarily blame HR, rather the seemingly ad-hoc nature of the actual interview process itself (e.g. asking textbookish ""what is a singleton?"" instead of ""Solve problem XYZ"" self-selects the kinds of people that are unwilling to learn new stuff -- add them to a bunch of old-timers who know a lot of old stuff, and you have a potent mix).
Around the time I left, company policy removed the criteria of having a computer science degree for being hired as a developer -- read into this what you will.
I felt this people factor made everyone excessively paranoid, since, unable to rely on reason for how things should work, they were often reduced to superstition (""don't touch that code -- copy-paste it instead and put it on a flag instead!"" -- rinse and repeat, and you have spaghetti code the likes of which you cannot imagine -- unless, of course, eventually, inevitably -- you have to fix it)

#3 - Opaque work environment -- I never had a clue why we were doing what we were doing, or why we stopped doing it and began doing something else. Mysterious communiques were occasionally delivered once a year, and then ignored in the actual work ordered throughout the year.

#4 - Poor software principles - I was gonna lump this in with #1 or #2 but it deserves special mention since it encompasses and encourages both of them. Expect to waste days, weeks (months ?) doing monotonous work, only because people are unwilling, unable (or both) to do things differently. The excessively proprietary nature of *all* software means that not only are you forced to rely on substandard code, but also have to do without tools that are commonplace elsewhere (""What's that fancy svn/git thing ? We use RCS!"" (Seriously))

#5 - Weird billing process - at the end of each day, you're required to 'bill' time to a 'ticket'. Ok, nothing wrong with that. When I joined, I had no work for about two months -- I still had to bill time -- what's more, I saw that a couple of older employees in my team, actually *did nothing* and billed time to tickets they 'owned' for a long long time. This was quite bizarre at first, but after sufficient time, I internalized it and became a certified slacker myself.

#6 - Top down review process (actually, top down everything) - Your manager has the first, last and only say in what your performance was. Period. (The rest -- employees sucking up to their manager, going behind their colleagues' backs to talk to managers, stabbing said backs etc. -- follows from this)

[Caveat here: I didn't really see #3, #4 and #6 as terrible things until I moved to a different place where I had transparency, good tools and some kind of peer review, and was able to draw some contrast. I'm told that most banks are similar, and so in that respect, Bloomberg is certainly ""no worse"" than many places]


Finally, I must confess to a soft spot for the place, it being my first employer, and in any large organization, no narrative can successfully capture the small details. My manager was ok with time off and sick days, and not (unlike some reviews suggest) scary, intimidating and excessively micro-managing -- but yes, I did observe (both first-hand and second-hand) other managers doing the same, and I will happily admit that I fared better than most."
"4127","Really ? OK I'll take this seriously -- its hard to change the entire culture of an organization overnight, and in this case, I'm not sure if it would be a good idea anyway (after all, the company as a whole is doing great, and it recently expanded its subscriber base beyond the 300,000 mark) so there isn't any incentive for management to do anything.
Unlike other reviewers then, I won't say things like... ""replace/retrain middle management"" etc. -- it just doesn't sound practical.

I would, however, request the initiation of some sort of feedback mechanism to ""listen"" to junior employees -- it is never profitable to make their lives better, or to retain replaceable personnel -- but it might help to spot any trend before it becomes a trend -- and if the rank-and-file are able to realize the difference between their work environment and a different one, and find an easy way out (a competitor? startups? some other job market change) -- there will be a trend indeed."
"4128","Backstabbing, Managers behave like dictators with no accountability throughout the chain of command, outright lies on performance reviews,performance is proportional to psychophancy, culture of meritocracy and fairness being systematically dismantled, basically a H-1B sweatshop, blame the person you don't like instead of the real culprit and get him/her fired."
"4129","Please leave the firm now.."
"4130","Poor codebase and development tools creates a maintenance nightmare, you can find yourself spending more time firefighting and working around inefficient old code than creating new apps. Culture changed a few years ago to a 'metric' based system where you get rewarded more for ticking boxes and saying 'yes' to the right people further up the management chain (don't believe anyone who says the company has a flat... structure - there are 8 levels above mine and this is typical). Coupled with their philosophy of mainly promoting eager to please, inexperienced graduates this has led to whole layers of incompetent mangement led by similar, more senior managers who have no industry or engineering experience other than at Bloomberg. The only way of improving your prospects is by enrolling in a 'leadership' course led by the very same people, few people are promoted based on ability. There is no distinction between project managers and those with the necessary people skills to manage groups. Pension is not particularly good. Used to be able to work from home occasionally but now this must be approved by senior managers, just one example of the atmosphere of mistrust which had led to a general atmosphere of low morale."

"4150","Management needs to pay more attention to their employees to ensure that the magazine is successful.  Teamwork is the key to success."
"4151","Like the other programmers pointed out, it is a dead end for senior developers.  Bloomberg uses proprietary technologies.  Your skills would become obsolete and irrelevant to other companies in 2~3 years.  If you plan to just get some experience and add a line in your resume, this place is definitely a good place to start.  If you have plan to stay for long term, think again.  Bloomberg used to offer generous... compensation packages and take care of loyal employees.  But since Mike left for New York City Hall, the culture has changed.  Loyalty is less important than profitability.  If you get stuck for more than 5 years and still don't get chance to move up the ladders, then you should definitely consider moving to other companies before it becomes too late for you to brush up your fading skills and memory from college."

"4165","Staff retention could be improved by spending more time to collate and address feedback."
"4166","Lots of incompetent people being promoted to managers--those who scream the loudest or just because they were good developers or got lucky (every other senior person left the team), but it doesn't mean they make good managers. It is as very easy to be demoted (as part of a reorganization, etc, I haven't seen it to happen as much in other companies). Unfortunately the incompetent managers always seem to stick around,... it is the good managers which usually suffer.

 R&D (programming dept)  uses a lot of ""in-house"" technologies, and public/mainstream technologies which it uses are technologically way behind other companies. There is still lots of C and Fortran code to deal with. New development is done in Javascript (not web based), and C++, but the company switched to C++ only about 5 years ago, and to Javascript about 3-4 years ago when everyone has done it decades ago. The more you stay in the the company , especially if you stay in one of R&D groups which doesn't deal with financial instruments directly, the less marketable you'll become shall you decide to leave the company.

The pay is above average for Junior developers, but tapers off once you become a Senior Developer. After discussing this with my friends in the company over the years, it almost feels like you hit some kind of a glass ceiling after 8-10 years in the company, unless you are a superstar (which means you have no personal life), some kind of a a genius, become a manager, AND have enough marketing stills to market yourself to your manager before your annual review.

Theoretically, the company has ""work from home"" policy now and some flexible work programs. But it practice, it has policy has been very limited and mostly used by middle-chain managers.

Lots more pressure on developers once the company instituted the ""Plan B"" reorganization, sometimes it's way too much.

 That said, everything totally depends on the team you're on. Even within the same group in R&D,there are good teams where developers are happy and stay for years, while in other groups developers are buried with work and work 12 hours a day until they transfer to a different team or quit."
"4167","Please be very careful as to who you make the managers and don't trust that person blindly, and listen to employees on the team. If several employees quit or transfer to a different team because of the excessive pressure, but the manager still shows ""great"" results on paper, does that mean that this person is still a good manager? In the long run, employee turnover is never good for the company. Employess should be... able to voice their concerns anonimously *anytime* or more frequently,  and not with a very rigid once a year employee feedback."

"4179","Remuneration is low for the location.  Bonus awards come in the form of equity which is given with an estimated value and allowed to mature for a year, then they're cashed out based on actual value.  Don't expect high award amounts either, there's a lot of expensive tropical fish to feed and by God they always come first.  Low-level management has a great deal autonomy, far beyond most workplaces.  Mid and high... level management is ok and is mostly composed of professional folks, but they don't do any dirty work - it's the low-level managers who do, and they can be prima donnas, especially if they have an axe to grind.  For that reason, brown-nosing is rampant through pretty much every department and you'll find a lot of folks eager to drink the Bloomberg cool-aid just to keep their jobs because they live in fear.  If you get along with your boss, you'll be ok - however, if you don't and he or she has got it out for you, they'll make your life impossible in every way they can until you're fed up, or just fire you outright.  When this happens, treatment of employees is often arbitrary and conflicts come up over trivial things - by which I mean that you'll be singled out for 'performance issues' while other people sit at their PCs and play fantasy football all day and not even get a talking to.  Your job description might also change to demand you get skills you didn't need before - either because someone else got fired, or because of a new responsibility placed on the department which might be similar or related to your career path. Bloomberg has an internal computer-based learning system with many courses free of charge, but should your new responsibilities require skills that fall outside of training that is internally offered, you'll find you will not get anything beyond a list of local training centers offering the course or certification you'll need to get a good review.  On the job training is nonexistent, because those who do have the knowledge are too busy to handhold those who don't until they get the hang of their new responsibilities, at least beyond the most basic aspects.  Employees are generally responsible to pay for any out-of-house training if their job description changes for any reason, which must be done outside of work hours.  Don't expect any loyalty from anyone in management - everyone is replaceable at the drop of a hat, no matter their past contributions.  But it feels like all of the above is a very well-put together management style, because it's so consistent across departments.  Like for example the fact that no one in the building has an office, it's all an open floor plan and the most anyone might have is a glass-segregated seating space.  So, bottom line, the company's not for everyone."
"4180","I would enhance the employee grievance review process and make it more transparent, less arbitrary - but the company runs the way it runs because of its management style and I can't really fault that."
"4181","Most of the senior management have their positions solely because they joined Bloomberg from the beginning. They do not have a lot of exposure and experience of rest of the world and are not very competent in management and technology and unfortunately they also have a lot of authority and ego. This causes miss-treatment towards  lower level staff and policies that don't make a whole lot of sense.

I was even asked by other departments to not let him/her near them because he/she didn't know what they were talking about and made everything worse. Operating system was extremely archaic and instead of using technology that was already out there the company instead... spent millions of dollars trying to make their own mediocre devices. Many ""star"" employees were hired because they were FOM - Friends of Mike - and were paid exorbitant salaries while dragging down the entire business. They would let go and outsource entire departments without any warning at all. Due to the use of only their operating system and their devices if you stay at the company for more than 2 years you are deemed unhireable by other companies because you have been ""bloombergized""- you pretty much lose your entire skill set unless you go home after work and study...which is what I had to do before I left."

Bloomberg has a lot of ridiculous bottlenecks that would... make any sane programmer cry with agony. I'm not understating this, you can get the hints from all the reviews up there before mine (at the same time, I'm surprised at some of the 4 and  5 ratings here!). These bottlenecks/annoyances are not just in your day-to-day development, but while you are in the building too.

No proper cafeteria area to eat your food -- the running joke was that the bigwigs expect you to eat at your desk and thus you will be around your desk to be called upon by your manager/peer during that time.

"4255","Maintain the excellent client focus, and hire more people to improve response times. Most teams are under-staffed.

Promotion is by merit of years of service to the company. Team leaders and managers are often insecure and have no people management skills: they are years behind in their general technical expertise/knowledge and only excel in their expertise/knowledge in Bloomberg-specific technologies.

Good... managers are often average by industry standards; average managers are awful. This is not so much a disadvantage since, ultimately, responsibility falls upon individual developers to get things done and working."

"4262","Bloomberg has tons and tons of legacy code, mostly in Fortran and C, and to add insult to injury, it's rarely commented/documented/explained in any shape or form -- when you make a function call, you often enter magic land. While there are no new Fortran files (company policy), you will almost certainly have to at least look at lots of Fortran in debugging it, and you may need to make code additions for bug fixes....
Bloomberg is a fast paced company (due to it being driven by Finance), but this means that you focus on getting the final product done ASAP -- which can be exciting -- but rarely will you get the chance to take time and properly design and develop a product, or refactor old code that, while not technically broken, is inefficient."
"4263","Please make active efforts to reduce technical debt in the code. Even if it's not broken, it's killing us all slowly to have to deal with it (at least, all us programmers), and it's adding time + money to our projects to have to deal with legacy hacks. If you reduce technical debt, you won't see a payout this year, but you will thank me 5 years from now."
"4264","Technology is extremely proprietary.  You're not working with open source technology, or even Microsoft tools.  You're working with Bloomberg specific technologies, many of which date back to hacky solutions from the early 80s.  A lot of the new stuff is poorly documented and in a constant state of flux.  I often am jealous of my friends who get to work with more interesting technology, even though I'm better... compensated.  The management is a bit lacking.  The structure is very loose (which can be a good thing), but sometimes things feel disorganized.  They don't employ any software methodologies or process, so even though they use rapid development, projects are poorly organized and lack planning and testing.  This also can make projects more stressful than they need to be."
"4265","Try to focus a bit on process and organization.  Changing the way projects are allocated and planned would be a great start.  Give back every now and then to the open source community, it will pay off."
"4266","Very challenging work. Stressful. The competition within the company is fierce. You have to stay on your toes if you are ambitious and want to move up the chain."
"4267","Management should market the company more aggressively. Even though this is a great company to work for, not many people know about it. Especially outside of East Coast. The visibility needs to be improved."
"4268","The Bloomberg terminal is pretty awful to use and management has no desire to change it significantly since there are lots of old time Bloomberg users who don't want it changed. If you enjoyed using computers in the 1980s, you might like the terminal.

There are no cubicles, only an open expanse of desks. Things get noisy, so it's hard to concentrate much of the time and anyone can see what's on your computer... screen. The environment is such that you always feel like you're being watched and controlled. Your clock-in and clock-out times are prominently displayed on the Bloomberg terminal when someone searches for you. There is a culture of working long hours and while you get lots of vacation time, there are subtle ways where it's implied that you shouldn't be taking vacation.

Teams don't necessarily have any incentive to work with each other. If you're put on a project and have to work with another team, sometimes the managers can get protective of their turf. It's more about competition than cooperation. I've heard Bloomberg described as groups of factions battling each other to get a job done. There's some truth to that description."
"4269","Upgrade your technology and make the Bloomberg terminal work like modern computers. Treat employees more like mature adults than children that need to be micromanaged, and have confidence in your employees to make decisions without constant oversight."

-Managers are often abusive towards subordinates both systemically as well as interpersonally and such behavior is tolerated and... almost seems encouraged.
-Managers are often promoted/selected on the basis of who has been there the longest and not in consideration of any actual ability to manage or lead.
-Programmers are permitted to behave in defensive and accusatory ways towards systems and internal-end-users whenever questions about their product arise.
-Employees at large are often treated as though they are attempting to take advantage of the company and policies are issued from senior management that are both heavy handed as well as indicative of a general distrust of the average rank-and-file employee.
-The technology here is old hat, and there are a lot of in-house solutions that won't help you acquire skills that are at all portable in the marketplace.
-Expectations of herculean efforts are common place and the hero mentality is prevalent; working 50, 60, 70 etc... hours per work is considered to be the sign of a good, great, incredible, etc...  employee.
-The method used to actually gauge an employee's value to the company, and in turn determine their compensation, is highly subjective and usually left to a team leader who is frequently biased.
-Review process does not allow an employee to respond to or refute any claim of underperforming or failing to meet goals -- these claims can and do affect the final review and in turn compensation.
-It is common place for the rank and file in R&D to be kept in the dark about upcoming projects and changes/additions to the overall technical environment until it is their turn to ""do X"" and even then said employee is still clueless about what is going on.
-The company does not encourage learning about the industry in operates in. Training is made available through ""Bloomberg University"" (aka BU), but at no point does the company encourage or require an employee to learn anything about what the financial services industry is or how it works.
-Policies are applied to R&D, if not the firm, in a blanket fashion; but it is not uncommon for these policies to be contrary to the common good of selected groups that must now adhere to such rules.

First thing they don't have good and deeper technical knowledge as they don't necessarily have all basic computer science background and understanding of product as whole. Having knowledge just about a language (like C/C++) is not same as having actual product... development knowledge. Second thing since they are straight out of college they don't  have any outside experience and they feel that they do the amazing work while actually its not the case.  Also they are just too random/impetuous and irresponsible in their decisions.These guys just tend to make their Evals/Compensation better by making their team members to work the way their managers expects from them. Nowhere in all this, actual product development is been given more importance. They give more importance to the actual no.of hrs worked on rather than the efficiency and output. Also here more importance is given to number of bugs fixed, rather than actually finding the root causes and reducing the number of bugs generated in first place. That's the reason why sometimes its more of a mechanical work/mechanical temporary fixes than a good, challenging work which requires talent. These team leads don't give any credit to the team members who actually work on, but rather will try to explain their contribution in any good thing the members do.
Its hard for smart/talented computer science people to strive in the company. The company just needs to maintain their random codebase by keep on adding new things without any good design, introducing new bugs in existing thing, fixing them to introduce something new.....  one day that can end up beyond repairable !!"

"4406","Almost all the focus is on getting stuff out there 'fast'! Good coding style, good software design aren't as important. While that may work in the short run, in the long run it causes a lot of headaches in terms of software maintainence. But the management doesn't care about that. They just want you to churn more software out, as fast as you can.

And of course there is nothing called 'testing'. Its the developers... job of course. And you still have to get things out there 'in time'."
"4407","Please understand that you can't have more and more software out there, and still expect it be churned out in short time. The more software we have out there, the more we need to maintain it. If we just churn it out, with all the focus on time (and very little focus on good design) its like trying to juggle priceless eggs in variable gravity. At some point the bug rate is gonna overwhelm new development and that's... not what we want. 
While I understand the business need to develop new products in short time, it needs to be balanced with good design too."

"4410","Code base is old and can be frustrating at times. Core technical people, who want to develop their technical skill set will be put off by the demand to get the solution out to customers, often sacrificing quality. If you're in a team that works on legacy products rather than new ones, the skills you pick up will be in proprietary techs that are not transferable. The flat hierarchy, (3 levels from new... fresh-from-college hire to the head of R&D) may not leave room for advancement that you can show on your resume."
"4411","Understand that even though thinking like a financial service company instead of a software company has paid off so far, there will come a time when the old old software core will catch up with the growth rate of the code base. For new, young engineers, there is too much that is set in tradition in the manner of working."
"4412","Every 6 months, there is often a change in management structure and procedures, which impacts how people are motivated.   Often when a new initiative or product launch is announced and implemented the functionality or enhancement has not be tested enough."
"4413","The company's core product is considered the premier product in the industry.  However to implement a company personnel ranking system, that was used at Goldman Sachs in not an effective way to increase productivity.

"4416","Salary is not competitive at all which is very demotivating. Career prospects are poor and senior management have not been trained in leadership at all. Working hours are NOT flexible. You often feel like working in a factory and all that is important is statistics before quality. It doesn't feel like management cares about you at all which is bad for moral and team spirit. Lastly, Bloomberg is known for having a... very flat structure which is not really true. Even people used to working in investment banks say that Bloomberg's management structure is more hierarchical than those in banks. Unless you know the right people in the US it is very difficult to get a say in anything."

* There... are no separate cubical so everybody can see everybody else.. and environment is little noisy so becomes hard to concentrate.
* Managers are rude, don't respect team members.. good work won't get appreciation ever.. (and this is a culture.. this is not about specific manager).
* Top management have completely failed in managing software capital.. lot of code duplications.. software pieces are scattered here and there and there is no track of it.. often you will be writing a module from scratch even though its available somewhere else.
* interview process is tiresome.. they take 5-6 interviews and keep you on contracting for 1 month and that 1 month is a complete torture and then after their might be additional interview before the offer is extended !!!! TOO MUCH !!!"

"4441","For hiring software engineers, compare yourself to other tech companies not to other finance companies. This is a great job for people coming from the finance world, but for people coming from the purely tech world it's so-so. flex time and regular morale boosters would be good start to improving things."
"4442","Incompetent immature managers, repetitive work, crushing volume, crumbling technology that you must struggle to master, the ""knowledge"" you gain revolves around bloomberg and has limited value outside the company, constantly changing management objectives seem like desperate gimmicks, endless frustrated dissatisfied clients, very few genuine growth opportunities"
"4443","Accept that this system from the 80s is crumbling and driving clients and employees nuts, then work to improve it rather than foist unstable new feature after unstable new feature on hapless clients locked into long-term contracts. Promote smart managers, not your incompetent friends. It may be more meritocratic at the top, but the bottom and middle levels are a nightmare where bright, ambitious employees feel... isolated."
"4444","Increasingly confused compensation scheme. Seemingly reluctant to reward individuals for short term performance, loyalty and adherence to company values recognised above all else.

If you're fortunate enough not to be working on Fortran or some really old crappy C code, you still have to put up with an infrastructure that is from the 90s, maintain some ugly patchwork code. Everything is run based on unreasonable demands from business folks who don't understand software and you are constantly writing band aid solutions and patching... code. Your software engineering skills will suffer. Most of the management (on the tech side) doesn't know what it takes to be a good leader and is interested in hitting project deadlines dictated by the business at any cost without any regard for employee development. The only people who can be happy working there are people who started working there out of college, have only seen this culture, and are happy at being well compensated. You will not be happy if you've seen the world outside those glass walls. Do NOT go there as a senior engineer."
"4455","Understand that Bloomberg is primarily a tech company as your main offering is software. If you want to keep delivering good quality and innovative software you need good Software Engineers, not Programmers and you cannot keep those guys happy just by compensation.

"4459","It's hard to argue with the success that Bloomberg has had. I would say that the continued refusal to follow any modern, standard software development practices will create a drag on the company in increased costs and turnover and the refusal of ambitious creative programmers to work there. Bloomberg has enough money to keep going on its own but it's vulnerable to an upstart who does things right using modern tools."
"4460","Management  can be clueless  at times."
"4461","Listen to your employees.  They are closer to the clients then you are."
"4462","Hit or miss if you end up in a team with interesting work and a good manager - the exception rather than the rule. A lot of long-time employees with entrenched views make it a bit of a monoculture. Old technology and tools. A lot of busywork goes on."

The technology is old.
You can download freely available libraries/tools that are better than what's mandated internally."

People working here for 10 years are doing the exact same thing as recent university graduates. The work environment sucks with just... lines of desks and no vision/noise blocking devices; if you sit next to a manager, expect to have conversations/debates going on at all times. If you sit next to one of the projectors broadcasting announcements on the wall, expect to be distracted by flashing text every 5 minutes. Antiquated system architecture, and frequently broken development tools. Free food is good, but it's all chips, candy, and sodas, with few healthy options."

Managers in particular are risk averse to the point where you're relegated to cutting and pasting the same code over and over again ""because it's been in... production for a year."" 

Young workforce gleefully works 12 or 14 hour days, which becomes the dominant paradigm so those who want a balanced life or at least a parent for the child need to a stay-at-home significant other. What said young workforce has in enthusiasm, cloying hyperbabble, and comfort with the cult of Bloomberg they lack in depth of knowledge. They talk quickly, and generally know answers to specific questions, but don't understand systems from the runtime environment all the way down to bare metal. 

Management actually get angry if you question design decisions or spend time cleaning up code. Expect to be micromanaged and constantly berated with a stern ""Why are you doing that?"" at least ten times a day. 

The HR department is a travesty. The ""Bloomberg"" recruiters are contractors who then find other contractors. If you work as a contractor, expect absolutely no follow-up on questions to HR and to never, ever be able to get in touch with HR people, particularly the ""senior"" contracted HR recruiters. Like normal HR, they strive to keep the best talent out and consistently work half days. You're stuck trying to figure out even simple things for yourself. Basically, if you think for yourself, aren't willing to march to orders no matter how irrational they are, and have talent, you'll either be turned down or shown the door quickly with the Scarlet Letter rendering you unfit to ever work at Bloomberg again. HR is also very secretive and getting straight answers for important decisions is wasted effort. I've also heard stories that certain HR recruiters will lie in order to steer business toward specific vendors -- this is just speculation."
"4517","Stop hiring such young managers, take a longer-term view of your software assets, nuke your HR department (who's robbing you of talent that would actually improve your business), and realize that older engineers don't want to and shouldn't have to work 70 hour weeks."

- A lot of the junior level positions are given repetitive tasks.
- Some positions are extremely high stress.
- Work environment can be quite stiff (few people spend time together outside of work).
- Free snacks are mostly unhealthy."
"4547","Provide additional opportunities to foster a health work/life balance for all employees."
"4548","It is not a bank or investment firm. So, don't expect any front office exposure. Be prepared to work in technologies that may sound obsolete elsewhere. Be prepared for a deadline that is every other week."
"4549","Have a career plan for your employees."
"4550","The hours can be long, it is expensive to live in/near NYC, and sometimes upper management decisions are a mystery."
"4551","Remember that all your employees are professionals and most are invested in the outcome of your decisions."
"4552","The work culture is very unique. Some strict rules.
It's much bigger now than 5 years ago and profit sharing are no longer that lucrative.
Some of the senior management's decisions are difficult to grasp."
"4553","Good job so far. There should be more transparency and employee feedback for decisions made by senior management."
"4554","The job is monotonous and limits opportunities sometimes. Job as a financial software developer deals with creating softwares for financial data."
"4555","Be more thoughtful towards employees and try to appreciate and reward the employees when they deserve it."
"4556","ancient systems to support. not much exposure to outside clients"
"4557","provide opportunities to upgrade ancient systems"
"4558","legacy software, tougher to look for a job elsewhere once you quit due to the extremely proprietary nature of technologies used, some very smart people, but a lot of people who have been writing GUI code in fortran too"
"4559","so far, so good"
"4560","The company insists that everybody comes to the office every day. Until recently working from home was never allowed. Even now it is highly discouraged by management. Software is hurried without good design and with little documentation. There is a lot of proprietary software and after a few years your expertise starts to decay. The open plan seating arrangement does make communication between employees better but... the noise and interruptions make concentration impossible. The corporate culture with its automated system of tickets give you the feeling of being constantly rushed to deliver. The overly complex and poorly organized software lowers productivity."
"4561","Hire more managers from outside. Management should realize that the Bloomberg way is not the only way and lessons could be learned from elsewhere."
"4562","Career advancement is hard.
Management decisions may be hard to fathom."
"4563","Employees must have a good idea of how they can help make Bloomberg better in their particular role, not as a generic org-wide mantra."
"4564","A problem is that a lot of talented Programmers leave because they are really not challenged there. As a quant, Bloomberg will not necessarily be the brightest star on your resume, regardless of famous quants that consult there."
"4565","Stay true to your mission statement and offer better opportunities to be express creativity and innovate in new products and applications."
"4566","Sub-average compensation, limited management opportunities, strategy not always explained by senior management, management often not willing to pay competitively for superior talent, management skills not always valued compared with technical skills"
"4567","More communication"
"4568","In IT(or R&D as we call it) the scope for growth is limited because of the flat hierarchical structure. Also the managers nor the company takes much active interest in employee's professional growth. also the work can get boring sometimes."
"4569","even as we explore uncharted territory, we need to stick with the same formula that makes bloomberg successful and a great company to work for"
"4570","The company is very ""metrics driven"".  Many of the jobs are very stressful and tedious.  Management has little trust in its employees.  And for a modern company, they are not accomodative to employees who seek work-life balance.  Career opportunities are primarily in the company's New York HQ.  Employee morale is very low since Mike Bloomberg has left to be mayor of New York.  The company is very youth oriented.  I... have seen few employees over 40 promoted or treated well.  There is a hidden, and at times overt, atmosphere of hostility toward older employees.  All employees are expected to fit the ""Bloomberg mold.""  There is little tolerance for individual differences....  Finally, management is quick to point out shortcomings, but rarely praises things that are done well."
"4571","Creat more career opportunities at its Princeton office.  Many of the jobs performed in New York could also be performed in Princeton.  Examples include:  application specialists, software engineers that do more than maintenance programming, and human resource trainers/instructors.  Moreover, employees should be free to work from home when they need or want to since many of the jobs at Princeton are data analyst... positions that do not require being in the office.  Finally, employee reviews should actively seek input from the employee as to how he would like to progress in his career with the company."
"4572","Sort of a sweatshop. If you're not careful, you might get lost in it; big corporation, hiring process is slow."
"4573","More disclosure on employee policies and more authority to hire journalists."
"4574","Ancient architecture, no coding standards, no commenting of code, no documentation, poorly designed and documented, buggy, incomplete GUI framework which you are forced to use, weird UI standards, little inter-group code sharing, poor common tools"
"4575","Work more on setting up coding standards, force people to document their work better, rewrite some ancient bits or otherwise create a modern wrapper around them, create a common toolset and develop it, hire 5x more people onto the GTK team so that the GUI framework everyone has to use won't be so horrible."
"4576","Utter stifling of creativity and innovation. You're required to detail all time spent in programmers notes. Try putting in some notes about thinking about the big picture! It would be comic if not sad that humans are expected to work and act as automatons -- and dumb automatons at that, impervious to the fact they're being talked down to at every minute. I've watched really smart people who needed the money become... shadows of their own selves. Oh and not to mention: the technology is antique."
"4577","Bloomberg as-is is an excellent money machine for Mike. There's no reason for him to change anything about it, and senior management has no incentive to do so. Unless Mike is rebuffed in getting a third term as mayor, and in the highly unlikely event he ever returns to run the L.P., the purpose of management is to keep the numbers good and to feed the animals. If you're a senior manager who wants to change that --... you'd better be truly superlative. I wish you luck."
"4578","stifles creativity, work is repetitive. there is little coaching and professional development from higher ups. you can get easily stuck in a box covering the same thing over and over again, and find yourself writing the same stories five years later. When i left to go to a newspaper I had more experiences in a month than I did reporting for a year and a half in this office"
"4579","give writers more freedom to pursue their ideas, not every story has to be of earth shattering importance. sometimes some of the best stories involve following leads on ideas that may not seem so significant at first."
"4580","There is very little upside to working at Bloomberg.  The compensation system is nowhere near ideal, as your bonus for this year is paid out in the following year, to ensure that you stay at the company.  Mobility is extremely limited, and it seems that the company has been moving backwards ever since Bloomberg left the company to become mayor."
"4581","A more equitable bonus system is required."
"4582","The salary is quite bad considering the industry and what Bloombergs competitors pay. Managers are often incompetent, too young and obviously never received any kind of management training. Therefore (salary) reviews and promotions are based on managers preferences and not on your actual performance. 
There seems to be a huge divide between people that have been hired in the last 5 years and those that have been... there longer. The senior staff seems to be paid well which results from the much better salary levels they had under Mike Bloomberg (or so they say) and then there are the younger ones, many of those leave the company after less than 2 years..."
"4583","Start paying your staff and think about ways of career development for people that are with the company for more then 2 years."
"4584","Long long long hours.  Managers that have no management skills. A lot of arrogant, and no goods to back it up.  If you need to go to the doctors or dentist, you have to take a vacation day.  I worked there for over a year and I have never seen more people wheeled out by the ambulance than any where else. People pass out of exhaustion from working there."
"4585","You need management training.  Human Resources needs to clean house and really evaluate managers. But the problem is, they need training themselves. It's like the blind leading the blind there."
"4586","Bloomberg was a great place to work a few years ago.  However in the last few years it has become increasingly bureaucratic.  It has lost the vision and zeal of its founder, Michael Bloomberg.  Today the same creativity and boldness that Michael Bloomberg encouraged is no longer an asset, in fact, it is discouraged.  The user interface for its primary product is dated."
"4587","Spend more time in the trenches to get a pulse on employee morale.  Live up to your promises."
"4588","the hours are too long and it is expected that you 'go the extra mile' often. Holidays are rubbish. Some of the work due to the technologies used can be repetitive, and often you don't have time to do the job properly. Some of the people you have to deal with on the business side are clueless."
"4589","fully embrace the concept of a work-life balance; tailor hours & holidays to local conventions"
"4590","long hours, too much pressure for the money you get; ""pushing"" all the time from the management; unbearable"
"4591","Look after your employees and have some respect for them!"
"4592","long hours, too much pressure for the money you get; ""pushing"" all the time from the management; unbearable"
"4593","Look after your employees and have some respect for them!"
"4594","incompetent managers - don't know how to manage people. have no experience in managing people. reluctance to take risks and eager to pass the responsibility and fall out to other people - no ownership of development or direction of business."
"4595","groom people internally early on to become managers. most managers have only worked at bloomberg and have no idea on how to manage people. they have lived in a bubble that is bloomberg. most of them are highly unsophisticated and cant inspire people to perform better."
"4596","Difficult to grow as its such a huge organization. Not much learning  happens, unless you spend a lot of time at the firm and proactively try to learn stuff. Job as such wont teach you much. Sad to say this, but the image of this company is overhyped outside. Most of the time you are actually doing backend, boring and monotomous jobs (with the possible exception of some of the sales guys)."
"4597","Like the new direction the new company is taking. Keep up the good work."
"4598","Very nasty people, close-minded bully management"
"4599","Fire your existing technical managers and hire a new team!! A lot of managers at Bloomberg are allowed to do whatever they want, and what they do is completelly destroy productivity by putting people down all the time."
"4600","Ethically void.  A/C and Heating are unstable.  If your boss is harassing you, and you tell their boss and HR, YOU will be written up (but still given a bonus).  Management is incompetent (promotions based on the ability to brown nose, not actual ability to do/learn/improve anything aside from staying in same position for 8 years)."
"4601","Stop promoting incompetent people. Consider stupid investments a sunk cost; don't throw more money at something that clearly doesn't work."
"4602","There is little flexibility in terms of people's roles. The company has grown so fast that it is no longer as entrepreneurial as it used to be. It is incrementally innovative but never fundamentally innovative. The culture seems to prize the amount of hours employees spend at the terminal as opposed to the quality or originality of ideas they contribute. Loyalty is also paramount."
"4603","Give employees breathing room in order to generate ideas."
"4604","Long hours, some of the technology in use is truly awful (although in recent years this has improved tenfold, so there is now a mix of OK and very bad)."
"4605","Forget trying to add facebook style social elements to the terminal. Go through some ADSK tickets--you'll see from the number of complaints for POSH<GO> and DINE<GO> email notifications etc, that people do not want a half-baked facebook knock-off. They want modern, useful functions to make their job easier--e.g. IMAP<GO>. 

Invest some resources into updating old, core functions (granted it's not... going to sell terminals so I'm not saying go nuts on it, but a little would be good).

Hire some people who know about UI design and interaction, the terminal's general level of usability is not good, e.g. the rigmarole involved in sending an email attachment."
"4606","The biggest downside is that the company is divorced from Silicon Valley and its ways, making it hard for former Bloomberg employees to return to greener pastures. The projects are effectively managed by the sales organization, which is eager to please the customers often making impossible promises, rushing projects and asking for shortcuts left and right. As a result, the code is chaotic and archaic, and in bad... need of huge rewrites and lots more testing.

Some of the projects are ill-conceived from the start; several projects in my team that took months to develop received little or no use from customers, and the salesperson that asked for the feature, having signed up the client, has no interest in pushing your product.

Your experience varies significantly depending on who your immediate manager is; it may very as far as the flexibility of your workday - some managers expect you to be at work no later than 9:00 and some others recognize that the flexibility to choose, within reason, what time you come to work in the morning, will affect your output."
"4607","The management needs to have a larger attention span, and needs to make more bottom-up decisions. The inherent distrust between the sales and R&D organizations will only heal if the developers have a chance at fixing the architectural chaos that makes development at Bloomberg so hard."
"4608","The technology is ancient (the majority).  A lot of programmers are simply maintaining legacy code (fortran, c) that cannot be retired or converted.  The company also uses a TON of proprietary software, all developed in-house.  For example, they've created their own Service oriented architecture (ala WSDL), two home-grown databases, entire UI framework, and other things.  It's very easy to get ""stuck"" at bloomberg... because you might be using proprietary tools 75-90% of your day!  Also, there is an entire lack of structure when it comes to the software development cycle.  Projects are handed out with no formal written documentation: let me repeat, NO formal written specs!  There is also NO official testing (no qa teams whatsoever!).  The programmer is expected to perform the testing of their applications."
"4609","Put in some people that worry more about doing things right than bottom line numbers.  Morale is somewhat low in certain groups."
"4610","not a lot of women in charge"
"4611","hire more women!!"
