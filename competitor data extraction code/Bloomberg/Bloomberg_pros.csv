"1","very technical environment, most others in the programming group in London are highly talented. Money is fairly good considering the job is safe and you're not actually in a bank. Some of the work can be interesting though that is very dependent on the group you are working in."
"2","Not bad as first job, especially if you dont know what else is avilable. Also good if Bloomberg name appears on CV. Others mention free food, but in London office they dont even have place to eat for employees: you are supposed to eat at your desk or eat out all the time. My salary at Bloomberg would not allow me to do much of the latter. It is good palce for someone who like to work non-stop, prefferably without... breaks, who can give 110% for the business and leave -10% for yourself and personal life. It is not me for sure."
"3","great benefits, free snacks, amazing building and office environment"
"4","Free food, good work-life balance. Regular office parties, lots of free booze :). Firm seems to spend money like crazy, at the slightest excuse. Pity that they dont cut down on unncessary parties and so on, and increase employee pay a bit more. Work culture is good, and mostly your superiors are really open and accessible to you, no matter how low down the rung you are."
"5","A well known name, but nothing else"
"6","Great building, competitive salary, excellent benefits package, multi-cultural environment.  If you are fresh from college, have no work experience, or would like to find someone to date, an excellent place to work!  Unlikely to get fired for any reason.  Free food.  Really high turnover, so you may get a sales job even if you were a programmer."
"7","Great benefits packages. They take care of you. It's a culture that prizes efficiency above all else. It's easy to get postings abroad. They're the dominant player in the financial data market."
"8","Compensation, relaxed work atmosphere--no dress code and semi flexible hours."
"9","Compared to other Computer Science job opportunities in New York City and elsewhere in the field, Bloomberg gives some pretty attractive packages; the benefits are great, the workplace is vibrant and most coworkers are competent."
"10","Drawing points for Bloomberg: great compensation/packages, intelligent co-workers, industry leader.  At work  you'll be working with some very intelligent people, some known widely throughout the industry.  It's also nice to work for a company that is the industry leader in financial data and news - it blows all competitors out of the window.  Depending on your personality, you may or may not like the fact that the... pace at Bloomberg is very fast.  Unlike traditional software companies, where time is spent on requirements gathering and design, Bloomberg emphasizes time to market and getting things out the door: software moves once a week, not once a year like other companies."
"11","Global opportunities, generous benefits, good work-life balance, limited downside in bad times (no layoffs), compensation structure and criteria are clear and transparent to all"
"12","competitive salaries

"13","Bloomberg provides a solid benefits package for its employees.  It is one of the few companies that I have worked for that pays the entire cost of health insurance for its employees.  The company also provides 3 meals a day at ""no cost"" at its Princeton, NJ location.  If you are interested in state-of-the-art analytics for the financial markets, this is a great place to work."
"14","Compensation and benefits, resources and support."
"15","High pay, free food, beautiful building, great location, smart people."
"16","Pay is good and if you show up on time and write tidy programmers notes you'll never get fired."
"17","worldwide reach, chance to cover a variety of subjects. The pay is pretty good compared to other news organizations that you will work for. Your job is probably more secure at Bloomberg, because they are more immune to changes in the economy than other news organizaiton because they cater more to the financial community"
"18","The compensation at Bloomberg for entry level qualified positions is relatively high.  It is a well-known company and a very recognizable brand name."
"19","It is great for a first job as you are exposed to different fields of work and quickly learn how things work and get client exposure. For somebody who wants to start in finances you can learn a lot and then move on. Also the work enviroment is nice, the teams mostly work well together, you go out in the evenings and the athmosphere is friendly."
"20","If you have absolutely no other choice. If McDonald's will not offer you a job.  This place gives you free food and free prescription. They have a nurse that works there all the time.  You have to wonder why they would need a full-time nurse."
"21","- Excellent health and vacation benefits.

- Free snacks

"23","The atmosphere is fast paced, the salary is decent as are the bonuses (at least so far), communication channels are fairly clear compared to many other places I've worked. I've seen some complaints about programmer notes in some of the other posts, but at least there are systems for tracking issues, projects and work completed--I've worked in many places outside the finance industry where things aren't nearly as... clear-cut. 

Many of the Plan B changes appear to be intended for improving retention, especially for employees with families. Bloomberg used to be notorious for requiring ""face time"" from employees; having the option to work at home for a day when kids are sick makes life a lot easier."
"24","The company offers competitive pay, and a great benefits package that is better than investment banks.
There is free food.
The people working there are friendly, smart, and generally easy going compared to people at investment banks.
More job security than investment banks.
Fast paced work environment and some very interesting work.
Ability and talent, not seniority, are recognized and rewarded.

"33","Early responsobalities, you get in touch with clients very quickly and if you proove them you can handle hard job and responsabilities they give them to you.  You don t have to be lazy or average otherwise you will be treated as average."
"34","The people without a doubt - as with any office you find people that you just don't have much in common with, or particularly like. But the employees are so diverse you can't really go wrong - you'll always meet a bunch of people you become great friends with"
"35","Solid, reliable product; great sales and marketing tools; excellent people to work with"
"36","Good company culture, there are a lot of senior level people who invest in you and want to see you succeed.. I was there as a summer intern in 2008, and the pay was great, another sign that they are interested in you. The building is also extremely cool, and new age. There are several stocked pantries that provide free food, coffee, and soft drinks."
"37","Compensation, Benefits,Good Medical Insurance, 401K Match, Bonus"
"38","Good People. The people are young, vibrant and outgoing. There is free food. Very transparent company. Class participation is part of the grade.  There are many ways to do this, including coming to class, raising questions in class, joining in class discussions and responding to questions raised during class.  Attendance is not explicitly recorded for the class or the section, but it constitutes a crucial learning... experience for the class.
In class discussions, our collective goal will be to unravel the facts of the case and explore a variety of reasonable approaches and solutions.  Grades are assigned on the basis of class participation that contributes to this process.  Emphasis is not on the duration of your “air time” or on getting the “right” solution (typically, there is no “right” solution).  Rather, I will be looking for summaries of case facts, well reasoned view points, constructive questions, or other relevant insights that enrich the discussion.  Please note that during class"
"39","The work place environment is great, T.V. monitor everywhere, glass meeting rooms, expensive desk and chairs, locations in top financial districts. Culture at Bloomberg is very interesting as well with colors and art. Also I have grown to love the perks with the food and beverages."
"40","Great building, competitive salary, excellent benefits package, multi-cultural environment. If you are fresh from college, have no work experience, or would like to find someone to date, an excellent place to work! Unlikely to get fired for any reason. Free food.

"44","- Decent Benefits
- Good compensation
- Market leader
- Stable job
- No layoffs"
"45","The pantries are nice, although the majority of the food is basically vending machine fare. The building is constructed entirely with glass walls which is either cool or utterly fascist depending on cynical you are. Working on Solaris 10 and C++ -- and IF YOU GET INTO THE RIGHT GROUP (not GTEC, ADSK, or GSUS), you'll definitely improve your chops. Interesting mix of technologies. Lots of hot women, although chances... are none will actually date you."
"46","Good place to start off a career.  They provide plenty of perks for employees to make them feel appreciated.  They were patrons of the arts and community service, which is quite unique within the finance industry."
"47","good benefits, opportunity to travel and use languages, good to learn about finance if you do not come from a finance background, reasonable hours,"

"49","Good company to work for if you are in the right department.
Lot's of young and good looking women.
A playground if you are single."
"50","Pay is extremely good -- twice what anybody else is offering."
"51","It's a fun company to work at although the work can be a drag, the entry-level positions aren't that great so you have to work hard at distinguishing yourself.  Network heavily and step up, make your own career."
"52","overall they offer a good salary  + benefits package with pretty challenging work . you get to work with very smart colleagues so there is a lot you can learn . they also give you a lot of responsibility form the beginning"

Company estimates that they spent $4600 annually on you and now even mention it in annual compensation statement. But they should be given credit for liberating you from your weekly grocery shopping and a task of finding something to eat in your empty fridge when you are late for the... work), great place to start your carrier when you are just out from college and cannot find a job ANYWHERE because no one needs your business major and, let’s face it, you learned nothing in college, annual summer parties that are actually are not so great as they used to be when company was smaller"

*Benefits are outstanding.  I do not know anyone else who works for a company that pays 100% of the premium and, for example, two different ophthalmologists remarked to me that I had one of the best vision plans available.  Vacation time... is very good too--20 days plus 9 public holidays.  Compare that to Amex: only 23 days total for employees with 0-4 years of tenure.  Sick time is unlimited, but be careful with that--managers are hyper sensitive to abuse (rightfully so).  Only con with vacation time is that there's little opportunity to grow this--employees with 10+ years get a bump to 23 days, plus public holidays, but that's the max.
*Ample opportunity to move to a new role, although roles in Princeton office are not a varied as the 1,000 employees might suggest

"786","-Only need to work 8 hours a day
-Company has enough resources to allow developers to experiment. In over 30 years of operation, never had a year of negative growth, so there is no sink-or-swim mandate
-Training program for non-CS entry level hires is a great way to transition into software
-Teams are small and functional-focused, so developers get a lot of code ownership. 
-Company grows fast, so there are... opportunities to move up. This must be taken with a grain of salt, since there are thousands of developers at the company, but many of the team leads have only worked there for 3-4 years, sometimes less.
-Jumping between groups is highly encouraged, so even if you don't want to manage people, you can always try something new. The process is well-defined, so no need to go behind your manager's back

"787","Access to training and education, cool office, free snacks, excellent benefits, some great people"

"801","Professional, Ethical, High emphasis on learning and open communication"
"802","When free food is the bigger pro you can think of, there isn't much to like about. Benefits are good too I guess. And since they hire a lot of fresh-out-of-college grads, it can be a good starting place."
"803","Health Insurance, Nice Office, Good People.
I met some great people at Bloomberg and their health insurance and other benefits are without a doubt the best you can get. At first it appears like a meritocracy that values creative thinking and good work. There is some mobility within the firm and if you are pushy enough and talk to the right people you can try new things. Their philanthropic efforts are really great... and you have a lot of opportunity to participate, which the company will generously match."

I definitely enjoyed that aspect of the job."
"819","Bloomberg takes care of its employees, from free snacks to an generous HR policies, it's a great place to work. 4 weeks vacation to start!

Also there is a wide variety of people from Finance analysts to R&D with varied backgrounds and experiences. There is no one bucket employees come from (though there tend to be too many MBA's in my opinion)"
"820","They try and lure you in with the free food and benefits which is good for only so long until you see what goes on day to day."
"821","Company is really dynamic - changes happen virtually every few months so you won't get bored. Environment is very good too - people are by and large friendly and supportive. Managers trust you with a lot of responsibility from early days. Performance is expected and rewarded."

"823","Decent pay, lots of opportunity to learn and grow, great office space"
"824","Great working environment, opportunities to move up"
"825","I was in the R&D department of Bloomberg for over 10 years.   The company is very profitable therefore job stability, health benefits, time off are all very good.   The company controls their own technology stack from the client software running on the user's desktop, to their network connection end to end, to huge data stores in their data centers.   As an engineer, there are many interesting problems to work on.  ... However, due to the profitability of the company, there is not much incentive to do basic improvements to their infrastructure, reduce operational costs, or increase automation.    This can be frustrating as much of the organization is involved in updating work tickets and doing manual changes.    This kind of environment can be great for someone who wants to not think or work too hard and just punch in the clock.. but if you are intellectually curious and are ambitious to learn new technology it can be very suffocating.  Further, much of the organization is involved in operational roles and have no desire or passion to improve technology."

"831","If you have the right frame of mind, you can develop a lot of freedom in what you can choose to work on.
Over the years I developed a reputation as a goto problem solver, and the result was that I could choose what projects I wanted to work on and how much of my time I spent on each project."
"832","It's good to work for a media company that has deep pockets.  I don't just mean the above-average compensation, benefits, nice offices, other perks. When this company puts its mind to something, it can throw resources at the problem. Whether it does or not is another issue.
It has a great core product. The Bloomberg terminal, when used properly, is a remarkable device. A parallel Internet.
Overall, the people I've... worked with and met at the company have been decent, caring, hard-working people.
The training options at the company are quite good but not always made available to everyone. You sometimes have to fight to get on courses."
"833","If you are a self-starter, innovative- and reform-minded person, you can enjoy working here. So many things changes in a year or so, and if you are independent even you can offer new ideas to make your work environment better. In some cases, anything can be possible kind of company. Compensation is probably the best among the journalism industry."

R&D folks, technical training for business-folks; payment for further education; sports teams to play on. Great healthcare, great 50% match on 401k; generous pay-raises and bonuses. Awesome training program for fresh-out-of-college hires: 12 weeks long, fantastic instructors for advanced C++ and javascript (and a lot more), plus great networking opportunities. Really well run.

"1013","Bloomberg provides a great many resources, including training, travel budget and good pay. A young person with the right credentials can rise in a reasonably short time if they find a mentor who can keep them clear of the internal politics and give them a push when opportunities present themselves. The writing style is restrained, but good for a young reporter starting out who needs to learn how business works and... can benefit from the structure and guidance during their formative years. It is a positive that Michael Bloomberg has returned. He's a great motivator. You'll want to run through walls for him."
"1014","Great Environment, Good Salary, Good Values"
"1015","Nice people (mostly) in a fast moving company. Steep learning curve if you are fresh from Uni"
"1016","Bloomberg isn't really a finance company - it's a technology company whose primary clients happen to be in the financial sector.  As such it is the equivalent of Google or Facebook in its world.  For the software developer, it offers a chance to work on a large scale, distributed system used by 300,000+ premium clients to help them make decisions within the financial markets.  This means solving problems of... scalability and robustness on a scale which relatively few other companies other than the ones already mentioned may have to deal with.  The work environment is friendly and open, and the company is constantly working to refresh its technologies in order to advance its products."
"1017","The company is run by owners rather than professional managers and they care more about the company because it is their company.  The benefits are the best I have ever seen.  The company values loyalty, rewards hard good work, and is generally a meritocracy.   The level of politics is relatively low compared to many big companies."

I'm not particularly interested in finance as a career, and I have no intention of ever working for a bank, but finance provides a lot of interesting problems to solve, which keeps my... job interesting after 4 years.

Compensation has been excellent, both starting and yearly raises. 4 weeks vacation, reasonable work from home policy (no questions asked as long as its not a regular thing, but nobody regularly works remotely).Other perks include two very nice Manhattan offices and excellent benefits.

Spectacular offices, some truly brilliant employees, plenty of perks like company-wide parties and free food, fantastic benefits and good salaries. There's a true buzz to walking the neon halls created by a still living, self-made billionaire; it bestows on... employees the feeling of being among the chosen. But when the buzz wears off (usually when one starts focusing on the paranoia behind Bloomberg's many security systems) one begins to wonder whether one is truly ""chosen"" or simply captive."

I worked at a couple of banks before joining Bloomberg, I've moved on to do different roles at Bloomberg within the... last 6 years, I'm still learning everyday!

"1532","My pros fall into four key areas: the people, the space, the exposure to senior management, and the balance. 

The people: My co-workers are a great bunch of people, many of whom have become my close friends. It's a supportive environment that encourages collaboration -- and I know I can lean on my team when I need them. Plus, my colleagues are super smart and they make me laugh. Overall, Bloomberg employees are... very hard-working, and I respect that kind of work ethic.

The space: 731 Lex knocks it out of the park. There's no other office building in NYC like it! The building is always buzzing with energy (and the occasional celebrity).

Exposure to senior management: I am very thankful to be put on projects supporting the company's senior leaders. I feel respected when working with people levels above me, and most of the time, I feel as though my work is valued.

The balance: (Disclaimer: I imagine this is very dependent on who your manager is.) My boss is very understanding. If I need to leave early or work from home, I leave early or work from home. I can still manage work, school, and my social life. Granted, some nights I stay late to get my work done, but they serve a pretty delicious dinner at 8 PM, which helps."
"1533","Friendly and approachable peers and managers
Care about training their developers in new technologies"
"1534","Great benefits:  Four weeks paid vacation, a company-match 401k that is above average, reimbursement for attorney registration, maternity leave, wage works program, a decent reimbursement for exercise expenses, and of course free snacks and drinks all day.   

Career development programs:  Bloomberg offers a ton of classes for employees through a program called 'Bloomberg University'.  You can learn the in's and... out's of finance as well as take classes to increase your technical abilities in XML, Excel, and basic programming.  There are also courses to improve public speaking, conflict management other useful business/interpersonal skills.  

Volunteer Opportunities:  The volunteer programs at Bloomberg at top-notch and really one of the most impressive parts of the company.  There are employee 5k's, big brother reading programs, and even opportunities to help build homes with habitat for humanity.  The culture encourages participation and in many instances Bloomberg will even match personal donations to many causes.  

Diverse community of peers:  There is no real 'type' at Bloomberg and that seems to be an intentional part of the hiring practices to ensure diversity.  I've worked with men and women of all backgrounds and always encountered a respectful and thoughtful interaction between my peers.  A decent HR program ensures that people act like professionals and even minor issues are quickly addressed.  I definitely feel a sense of pride to work for an inclusive community that encourages diversity."

"1611","Has a great working environment, people are young driven and enthusiastic. Work life balance is also really good. Would definitely do it again."
"1612","I worked as a Data Analyst within the Global Data department for several years. Overall I'd say this is a great place to work for those who want to simply collect their paychecks (pretty decent amount too) without all the stress often associated with similar salary range in any other firms. Keep calm and tag data, then you shall be rewarded with a peaceful and decent life. I have no idea how anyone can leave a 4- or... 5-star review of this place, but I am very happy for them that their experience working at Bloomberg was significantly better than mine. Here are some things I liked about working there:
- Free breakfast, lunch, and snack at the cafeteria - obligatory mentioning of the free food for the employees. I know it's cliche, and almost all past reviewers mentioned it, but it does save a lot of money for food. Don't expect anything too fancy, but hey, it's free. With that said, I should also mention that it's pretty sad for a workplace when almost everyone lists free food as their favorite part of their job.
- Very flexible hours and incredibly easy job – during my time at the firm, I never had to work late or come in during weekends/holidays. Most people come in after 8am and the office is deserted by 5pm. You only spend 2-3 hours each day actually doing your job (I agree with the person who called it “dystopia” – if you have to spend more than that, you should seriously reconsider your life), and are free to do anything you want (read the news, pretending to do work, etc) for the rest of the day. The job itself is incredibly easy, and I seriously doubt that you need a college degree to do any of our daily tasks. 
- Great benefits and decent salary – Bloomberg employees get some of the best benefits out there (health, dental, vision). You also get unlimited sick days on top of your 4 week paid vacation. I also think that the pay is pretty decent for what we do, at least for the NJ-based employees. I’ve read some reviews here (perhaps they worked in NYC) and heard my colleagues regarding how they think they are underpaid compared to “their friends who work for banks and other financial firms.” – I disagree with them. For what we do and how much work we do, I think the pay is fair. It’s pretty embarrassing to hear some of them comparing themselves to traders and PMs on the Street.
- *Some* great colleagues and constant collaboration – Like many other reviewers mentioned, you will meet some very bright colleagues in the firm. I also like that the company does a good job of promoting collaboration (both within the team/department and outside), so you can team up with smart people to work on interesting projects. The problem is that these people are rare, and they always end up leaving after several years because the job itself is nothing but repetitive and mindless. I have truly enjoyed working with some people during my time at the firm; I just wish I met them elsewhere so that we would work on something that actually mattered.
- High degree of freedom – most of the managers in the department are clueless and have no idea what is going on and what you are working on. This means that you have unbelievably high degree of freedom, and can get away with almost anything. You can literally not do any work for one full week and no one would say anything to you, so long as you remember to ask your managers how their weekend was, how their dogs are doing, how their kids did in their baseball/soccer game, etc. By the end of your first year, you will become an expert in small-talks and master the art of superficial smiles."

"1845","Very good, pays well, a lot of learning and innovation"
"1846","- How much you will learn varies greatly on the team. Thankfully, the process to change teams internally is seamless.
- Challenging work (depending on the team)"
"1847","Well paid, nice offices, good perks like company Amex card."
"1848","1. Plentiful ""free"" food and drinks, but considering the price you have to pay with the miserable nature of the work itself and dealing with such incompetent and humanly disastrous middle management, as the famous saying goes, ""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch!""
2. Very nice office location that houses well-respected firms like Goldman Sachs, KKR, and other prestigious boutique buy-side firms, but again,... for this, you essentially feel like an undeserved tourist strolling through the campus of Harvard University, dreaming the unattainable fantasy of becoming ""one of them.""
3. Letting you off from work sharply at 6 PM, but do the math, people. You're spending 10 hours of Orwellian 1984 to spend 4-5 hours of freedom? You better just get a job that makes you feel happy for 10 hours, work your butt off with passion, and just enjoy some solitude and peace (though not complete freedom) for 4-5 hours after work.
4. Great fellow batch-mates and colleagues. This, I must admit. Some of these people are brilliant individuals with excellent academic and professional credentials, but for some reason, got persuaded (more like trapped) by the recruiter's job sales pitch. Take note: These awesome people will try to leave within 1-2 years as well!
5. You get to become an expert on the Terminal, but let's be honest: if you were smart enough to go to investment banks or other financial firms, you get to use Bloomberg's Sales and Analytics people for your own use of becoming an expert on the Terminal. Do you have to work for Microsoft to become an expert on using Microsoft Office to put it in your LinkedIn skills? No."
"1849","Lots going on.  They take care of employees pretty well."
"1850","The Pros Large, diverse workforce with people from literally all over the world - you meet mostly really great characters but also some world class corporate duds. Very international working environment and exposure to international clients as you would expect. Free 'snacks' and drinks in a well-kitted pantry (though the novelty quickly wears off leaving you only with the bitter taste of a poor cup of coffee).... Training is in general quite good - but be ready for fast paced learning, where i.e. you are taught a condensed version of Portfolio theory in a day, and then are expected to sit an exam on what you've learned the following day at 8:00 am...not leaving you much time to absorb the knowledge, and inducing some university-style cramming. In that sense it helps a lot to come from a 'finance' background where you have studied the stuff before - but this is not essential as they spoon-feed you the knowledge to start with - many hires come from non-finance backgrounds. Competitive salary - especially for recent graduates (£37,250 base plus £4,000 performance related bonus). Finally, you'll learn how to use, and become an expert on using a terminal, where, if you are looking to kick start a career in Finance, this will be an invaluable addition to the CV. Oh and they throw a ridiculously good party once a year with free drinks, food and theme-park style rides. It turns into a rave once the families go home."

"2031","The breakfast, I long for that breakfast. 10+ types of cereal, 5+ types of bread, every conceivable type of milk (dairy! soy! almond!), hot oatmeal, fresh peanut butter, fruit, veggies. Need I go on? Eating breakfast at Bloomberg every day was sometimes the highlight of my day – and frankly, my grumbling stomach was a primary motivator to get to work many days.

Salaries are comparatively high, benefits are... decent-ish (swipe that AmEx and max out that 401(k) match, yo!), there’s a strong philanthropic mission and the Terminal is like a nerdier version of Googling.

There’s also a lotta eye candy in the office (hellooooooo sales), if that’s your thing. Or real candy, if you have a sweet tooth. There’s the summer party that keeps going downhill (just give employees the cash already!) and offers a “fun” opportunity to avoid people on a weekend who you actively avoid conversing with during the week. And where there’s a will, there’s a way...to cobble together a sad lunch at your desk (always your desk) that’ll have you saying things you almost come to believe…like, “But at least I didn’t spend $10!” (Which you know is a lie, because the halal guys have $4 sandwiches and there’s McDonald’s a stone’s throw away). 

To be sure, there are some really great people who’ve also gone wayward. If you find your peoples, some days are…fine. Plus, there’s always a layoff around the corner that gives you reason to daydream (‘til it happens to you) and then gossip about who got the ax, only to completely forget that person by the next day."

""Flexibility"" means ""Manage your time yourself as... long as your manager can constantly see you"".
""Flat structure"" means ""open space"" or maybe ""flat vertical structure"".
""Hard-working"" means ""Keep yourself busy till late"".
""Agile"" means ""Micromanagement"".

On top of that, it seems like the company has invested in its engineers to compete with some of the other top firms (especially true for the intern program), and it shows in the level of talent that the... company attracts. Overall this is a very competent engineering department and a good place to work that's getting better every year."
"2598","I’ve worked at Bloomberg Intelligence long enough to know the future here is far brighter than stuck in a broken bulge-bracket boiler room (do you remember the heyday - when the buyside trusted their views, Associates loved their jobs and Analysts didn’t live layoff-to-layoff? Then you are alone...). Like most of my senior colleagues, I was a successful Analyst at a traditional research shop you‘d know. Here I have... more client access, more access to companies and experts, and more resources to build my franchise. It would take a true lack of vision to ever go back.

I decided to write this after reading several narrow-minded nuggets, lobbed into this forum by some grumpy elves (so scarce at BI, most of us can guess who). I hope I can offer some balance, and not sound promotional because, frankly, working here is pretty good. I’ve taken enough interviews to know I have good options, and seen a few peers leave for seats they really wanted. To me, BI is the best place to be.

I’d also like to counter some of the unfair baloney leveled at management. I’m not a manager, but their fairness and vision is a key reason that I joined and that I stay. Know any “leaders” you’d follow among those still squeezing pennies out of sellside sweatshops? Ours have the honesty to see the legacy biases, vision to shape a novel product, and guts to get started.

The BI product is fun to write and powerful to read because a generalist can quickly engage it, an expert can dive deep, it is soaked in data and it is modular in a way that brings the right analyst’s voice into the right part of any report. Imagine writing a detailed research piece, but knowing your peers would link your best paragraphs right into their own work – and that you’d better recheck it often, because the graphs are live!

As an Associate, the pieces we author on industry basic concepts and indicators will be yours to write sooner than anywhere else. You’ll build company models experienced buysiders use to actually make decisions (not ones designed to play the “call me, I’m far out of consensus!” game)

You’ll also battle a bunch of weird new technology systems, and always wonder that the “rules” are! Why? Because, this is NOT an ancient financial house where a bunch of well-connected jerks rig rules to make sure you can’t get your full bonus or take their cushy job. This IS a (well-funded) startup, where quickly making anything new or cool clients want comes before designing a clear, simple career path for you and us. But, as always in life, uncertainty comes with benefits.

As an Associate, us Analysts will actually teach you to pick up coverage. We are growing, we have a lot more to cover and we don’t have to defend ourselves against your career progress! Oh, and we’ll let you have time to have a life at the end of the day. Oh, and you’ll actually make some friends, because it isn’t “you or them” in the next round of inevitable layoffs (see history of “real research” shops). Oh, and the top-to-bottom pay disparity here is FAR narrower than any I’ve seen on the street. Oh, and you’ll get to work at Bloomberg – where people are much happier overall than most places.

As an Analyst, you either already see why this is a great place – or not. In the latter case I’d probably respect you, but not want to work with you. I came here for novelty and innovation and to be with colleagues who were also uninspired by the bare-knuckles battle down the old-school path. Frankly, I’ve been paid well enough that I’m still glad I took the risk. Best of luck with MiFID 2!"

"2700","Caveat that your entire experience like any large company depends on what department and seniority you hold. My review for pros and cons centers on experiences in the financial products realm, not engineering, news or media. In terms of pros, Bloomberg has some great, really good, and good things going for it. 
 
There are some genuinely talented, smart people who when given the chance can do some great work. The... culture and environment is extremely energised and lively, and there is always a buzz in any of the top notch global offices. The Bloomberg Way of start executing, building, or doing first and figure out as you go along can be very powerful (but also detrimental as outlined in cons). 

The benefits are overall generally strong (especially in the US with no healthcare premiums) but not over the top. Some great cultural benefits and partner programs. 

Philanthropy is a huge part of the company and there are numerous ways to feel a part of that. The majority of company profits do go to funding Mike Bloomberg's philanthropic initiatives, which if you are aligned with those (like me) then it's great. There are also weekly (if not daily)  ways to get involved in countless other volunteering initiatives."

"2776","* Outstanding company to work for in terms of aptitude of people, healthy office culture, investment in product development and quality of product, relentless high touch focus on the customer. All the benefits you might expect from a global FinServ firm. 401k match, quality healthcare benefits, generous vacation time, in-office perks etc.

* Generous base salary especially through career progression and... out-performance. Sales bonus compensation is not directly tied to target/quota achievement making for a much more consultative, relationship based and less aggressive sales environment for clients. Qualitative / culture based metrics ensure high performance is not only based on quota, territory etc.

* Move towards more of a dollar quota culture in recent years is positive. Especially for Bloomberg terminal core sales staff this presents an opportunity to become a true enterprise account executive, versus traditionally selling units / terminals. This in turn becomes a more transferable experience. The high calibre sales people at Bloomberg I know of have embraced this change.

* Exceptional sales support network for post sales client support from the Analytics department and wider product/support groups. This takes admin-weight off sales significantly and has improved massively over the last 5 years. 

* Whilst a healthy pressure exists to hit quota, Bloomberg sales is not a cut-throat sales environment like e.g. Salesforce. This promotes a much healthier, collaborative working environment where sales are not stepping on each other. There is monetary recognition of collaboration and other BBg culture metrics.

* Strong culture of internal promotion especially into leadership positions -most of which are filled through home-grown talent. For me personally this was recognized through generous compensation at each stage. Still a concerning lack of female talent promoted to sales management, despite recent efforts to change this."
