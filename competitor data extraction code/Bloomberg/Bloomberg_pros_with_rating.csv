All the benefits you might expect from a global FinServ firm. 401k match, quality healthcare benefits, generous vacation time, in-office perks etc.

* Generous base salary especially through career progression and... out-performance. Sales bonus compensation is not directly tied to target/quota achievement making for a much more consultative, relationship based and less aggressive sales environment for clients. Qualitative / culture based metrics ensure high performance is not only based on quota, territory etc.

* Move towards more of a dollar quota culture in recent years is positive. Especially for Bloomberg terminal core sales staff this presents an opportunity to become a true enterprise account executive, versus traditionally selling units / terminals. This in turn becomes a more transferable experience. The high calibre sales people at Bloomberg I know of have embraced this change.

* Exceptional sales support network for post sales client support from the Analytics department and wider product/support groups. This takes admin-weight off sales significantly and has improved massively over the last 5 years. 

* Whilst a healthy pressure exists to hit quota, Bloomberg sales is not a cut-throat sales environment like e.g. Salesforce. This promotes a much healthier, collaborative working environment where sales are not stepping on each other. There is monetary recognition of collaboration and other BBg culture metrics.

* Strong culture of internal promotion especially into leadership positions -most of which are filled through home-grown talent. For me personally this was recognized through generous compensation at each stage.

"287",33,"Caveat that your entire experience like any large company depends on what department and seniority you hold. My review for pros and cons centers on experiences in the financial products realm, not engineering, news or media. In terms of pros, Bloomberg has some great, really good, and good things going for it. 
 
There are some genuinely talented, smart people who when given the chance can do some great work. The... culture and environment is extremely energised and lively, and there is always a buzz in any of the top notch global offices. The Bloomberg Way of start executing, building, or doing first and figure out as you go along can be very powerful (but also detrimental as outlined in cons). 

The benefits are overall generally strong (especially in the US with no healthcare premiums) but not over the top. Some great cultural benefits and partner programs. 

Philanthropy is a huge part of the company and there are numerous ways to feel a part of that. The majority of company profits do go to funding Mike Bloomberg's philanthropic initiatives, which if you are aligned with those (like me) then it's great. There are also weekly (if not daily)  ways to get involved in countless other volunteering initiatives.","5.0"

The work from home capabilities are decent. You can wear... whatever you want. Literally. Before I joined I thought BB was a stiff-necked cross between a bank and hedge fund. Nope. I was happily mistaken. They have fresh fruit, free soup, tons of coffee, and snacks for free - daily. Oh, and every office is littered with tons of exotic salt & fresh water tanks.

"387",44,"Ive worked at Bloomberg Intelligence long enough to know the future here is far brighter than stuck in a broken bulge-bracket boiler room (do you remember the heyday - when the buyside trusted their views, Associates loved their jobs and Analysts didnt live layoff-to-layoff? Then you are alone...). Like most of my senior colleagues, I was a successful Analyst at a traditional research shop youd know. Here I have... more client access, more access to companies and experts, and more resources to build my franchise. It would take a true lack of vision to ever go back.

I decided to write this after reading several narrow-minded nuggets, lobbed into this forum by some grumpy elves (so scarce at BI, most of us can guess who). I hope I can offer some balance, and not sound promotional because, frankly, working here is pretty good. Ive taken enough interviews to know I have good options, and seen a few peers leave for seats they really wanted. To me, BI is the best place to be.

Id also like to counter some of the unfair baloney leveled at management. Im not a manager, but their fairness and vision is a key reason that I joined and that I stay. Know any leaders youd follow among those still squeezing pennies out of sellside sweatshops? Ours have the honesty to see the legacy biases, vision to shape a novel product, and guts to get started.

The BI product is fun to write and powerful to read because a generalist can quickly engage it, an expert can dive deep, it is soaked in data and it is modular in a way that brings the right analysts voice into the right part of any report. Imagine writing a detailed research piece, but knowing your peers would link your best paragraphs right into their own work  and that youd better recheck it often, because the graphs are live!

As an Associate, the pieces we author on industry basic concepts and indicators will be yours to write sooner than anywhere else. Youll build company models experienced buysiders use to actually make decisions (not ones designed to play the call me, Im far out of consensus! game)

Youll also battle a bunch of weird new technology systems, and always wonder that the rules are! Why? Because, this is NOT an ancient financial house where a bunch of well-connected jerks rig rules to make sure you cant get your full bonus or take their cushy job. This IS a (well-funded) startup, where quickly making anything new or cool clients want comes before designing a clear, simple career path for you and us. But, as always in life, uncertainty comes with benefits.

As an Associate, us Analysts will actually teach you to pick up coverage. We are growing, we have a lot more to cover and we dont have to defend ourselves against your career progress! Oh, and well let you have time to have a life at the end of the day. Oh, and youll actually make some friends, because it isnt you or them in the next round of inevitable layoffs (see history of real research shops). Oh, and the top-to-bottom pay disparity here is FAR narrower than any Ive seen on the street. Oh, and youll get to work at Bloomberg  where people are much happier overall than most places.

As an Analyst, you either already see why this is a great place  or not. In the latter case Id probably respect you, but not want to work with you. I came here for novelty and innovation and to be with colleagues who were also uninspired by the bare-knuckles battle down the old-school path. Frankly, Ive been paid well enough that Im still glad I took the risk. Best of luck with MiFID 2!","5.0"

"1460",161,"My pros fall into four key areas: the people, the space, the exposure to senior management, and the balance. 

The people: My co-workers are a great bunch of people, many of whom have become my close friends. It's a supportive environment that encourages collaboration -- and I know I can lean on my team when I need them. Plus, my colleagues are super smart and they make me laugh. Overall, Bloomberg employees are... very hard-working, and I respect that kind of work ethic.

The space: 731 Lex knocks it out of the park. There's no other office building in NYC like it! The building is always buzzing with energy (and the occasional celebrity).

Exposure to senior management: I am very thankful to be put on projects supporting the company's senior leaders. I feel respected when working with people levels above me, and most of the time, I feel as though my work is valued.

The balance: (Disclaimer: I imagine this is very dependent on who your manager is.) My boss is very understanding. If I need to leave early or work from home, I leave early or work from home. I can still manage work, school, and my social life. Granted, some nights I stay late to get my work done, but they serve a pretty delicious dinner at 8 PM, which helps.","4.0"
"1461",162,"Great benefits:  Four weeks paid vacation, a company-match 401k that is above average, reimbursement for attorney registration, maternity leave, wage works program, a decent reimbursement for exercise expenses, and of course free snacks and drinks all day.   

Career development programs:  Bloomberg offers a ton of classes for employees through a program called 'Bloomberg University'.  You can learn the in's and... out's of finance as well as take classes to increase your technical abilities in XML, Excel, and basic programming.  There are also courses to improve public speaking, conflict management other useful business/interpersonal skills.  

Volunteer Opportunities:  The volunteer programs at Bloomberg at top-notch and really one of the most impressive parts of the company.  There are employee 5k's, big brother reading programs, and even opportunities to help build homes with habitat for humanity.  The culture encourages participation and in many instances Bloomberg will even match personal donations to many causes.  

Diverse community of peers:  There is no real 'type' at Bloomberg and that seems to be an intentional part of the hiring practices to ensure diversity.  I've worked with men and women of all backgrounds and always encountered a respectful and thoughtful interaction between my peers.  A decent HR program ensures that people act like professionals and even minor issues are quickly addressed.  I definitely feel a sense of pride to work for an inclusive community that encourages diversity.","4.0"

"1583",175,"- Benefits.  The benefits are comparable/sometimes even better than other large tech companies like Google/Facebook.  Aside from the pay, there's free food, free premium health care, extremely high 401k matching, and a very relaxed (yet fast for a large company) culture.  Aside from the mentioned, experienced hires receive financial advisers and lawyers for extremely low cost (around $16 a month I think?).  Oh, and... a minimum of 4 weeks vacation and unlimited work from home/sick days.
- Transparency.  This is one of the biggest advantages to this company over others.  You can literally view any Bloomberg code you want at any time you want.  The only restrictions in the company are really the law branch (for obvious reasons).  Everything is out in the open, and this lets work complete significantly faster than other companies of this size.
- Culture.  While maintaining competition, coworkers are generally all extremely helpful and come from some impressive backgrounds.  I've yet to come across anyone that's not willing to help out at all.  At most, I've had helped deferred due to an urgent issue, but I've hardly run into any instances where I've failed to receive help.
- Management.  Not much to say here other than I have never worked with a company of this size having this type of technical expertise...ever.  I can comfortably speak about C code to management two levels above me without any communication issues because they've all been through as a C/C++ developer at some point.","2.0"

All the benefits you might expect from a global FinServ firm. 401k match, quality healthcare benefits, generous vacation time, in-office perks etc.

* Generous base salary especially through career progression and... out-performance. Sales bonus compensation is not directly tied to target/quota achievement making for a much more consultative, relationship based and less aggressive sales environment for clients. Qualitative / culture based metrics ensure high performance is not only based on quota, territory etc.

* Move towards more of a dollar quota culture in recent years is positive. Especially for Bloomberg terminal core sales staff this presents an opportunity to become a true enterprise account executive, versus traditionally selling units / terminals. This in turn becomes a more transferable experience. The high calibre sales people at Bloomberg I know of have embraced this change.

* Exceptional sales support network for post sales client support from the Analytics department and wider product/support groups. This takes admin-weight off sales significantly and has improved massively over the last 5 years. 

* Whilst a healthy pressure exists to hit quota, Bloomberg sales is not a cut-throat sales environment like e.g. Salesforce. This promotes a much healthier, collaborative working environment where sales are not stepping on each other. There is monetary recognition of collaboration and other BBg culture metrics.

* Strong culture of internal promotion especially into leadership positions -most of which are filled through home-grown talent.

"2518",33,"Caveat that your entire experience like any large company depends on what department and seniority you hold. My review for pros and cons centers on experiences in the financial products realm, not engineering, news or media. In terms of pros, Bloomberg has some great, really good, and good things going for it. 
 
There are some genuinely talented, smart people who when given the chance can do some great work. The... culture and environment is extremely energised and lively, and there is always a buzz in any of the top notch global offices. The Bloomberg Way of start executing, building, or doing first and figure out as you go along can be very powerful (but also detrimental as outlined in cons). 

The benefits are overall generally strong (especially in the US with no healthcare premiums) but not over the top. Some great cultural benefits and partner programs. 

Philanthropy is a huge part of the company and there are numerous ways to feel a part of that. The majority of company profits do go to funding Mike Bloomberg's philanthropic initiatives, which if you are aligned with those (like me) then it's great. There are also weekly (if not daily)  ways to get involved in countless other volunteering initiatives.","3.0"
"2519",33,"Salary! BB pays very well. This is the first company I've been at that actually makes good on their promise of a bonus as well.  It's very stable here. This is NOT a hire / fire culture. They vet for the best and make every effort to make you successful in the company. If a team dissolves, they will work with you to find a new team - at least for engineers. The work from home capabilities are decent. You can wear... whatever you want. Literally. Before I joined I thought BB was a stiff-necked cross between a bank and hedge fund. Nope. I was happily mistaken. They have fresh fruit, free soup, tons of coffee, and snacks for free - daily. Oh, and every office is littered with tons of exotic salt & fresh water tanks.

"2607",44,"Ive worked at Bloomberg Intelligence long enough to know the future here is far brighter than stuck in a broken bulge-bracket boiler room (do you remember the heyday - when the buyside trusted their views, Associates loved their jobs and Analysts didnt live layoff-to-layoff? Then you are alone...). Like most of my senior colleagues, I was a successful Analyst at a traditional research shop youd know. Here I have... more client access, more access to companies and experts, and more resources to build my franchise. It would take a true lack of vision to ever go back.

I decided to write this after reading several narrow-minded nuggets, lobbed into this forum by some grumpy elves (so scarce at BI, most of us can guess who). I hope I can offer some balance, and not sound promotional because, frankly, working here is pretty good. Ive taken enough interviews to know I have good options, and seen a few peers leave for seats they really wanted. To me, BI is the best place to be.

Id also like to counter some of the unfair baloney leveled at management. Im not a manager, but their fairness and vision is a key reason that I joined and that I stay. Know any leaders youd follow among those still squeezing pennies out of sellside sweatshops? Ours have the honesty to see the legacy biases, vision to shape a novel product, and guts to get started.

The BI product is fun to write and powerful to read because a generalist can quickly engage it, an expert can dive deep, it is soaked in data and it is modular in a way that brings the right analysts voice into the right part of any report. Imagine writing a detailed research piece, but knowing your peers would link your best paragraphs right into their own work  and that youd better recheck it often, because the graphs are live!

As an Associate, the pieces we author on industry basic concepts and indicators will be yours to write sooner than anywhere else. Youll build company models experienced buysiders use to actually make decisions (not ones designed to play the call me, Im far out of consensus! game)

Youll also battle a bunch of weird new technology systems, and always wonder that the rules are! Why? Because, this is NOT an ancient financial house where a bunch of well-connected jerks rig rules to make sure you cant get your full bonus or take their cushy job. This IS a (well-funded) startup, where quickly making anything new or cool clients want comes before designing a clear, simple career path for you and us. But, as always in life, uncertainty comes with benefits.

As an Associate, us Analysts will actually teach you to pick up coverage. We are growing, we have a lot more to cover and we dont have to defend ourselves against your career progress! Oh, and well let you have time to have a life at the end of the day. Oh, and youll actually make some friends, because it isnt you or them in the next round of inevitable layoffs (see history of real research shops). Oh, and the top-to-bottom pay disparity here is FAR narrower than any Ive seen on the street. Oh, and youll get to work at Bloomberg  where people are much happier overall than most places.

As an Analyst, you either already see why this is a great place  or not. In the latter case Id probably respect you, but not want to work with you. I came here for novelty and innovation and to be with colleagues who were also uninspired by the bare-knuckles battle down the old-school path. Frankly, Ive been paid well enough that Im still glad I took the risk. Best of luck with MiFID 2!","5.0"

To be sure, there are some really great people whove also gone wayward. If you find your peoples, some days arefine.

2. Very nice office location that houses well-respected firms like Goldman Sachs, KKR, and other prestigious boutique buy-side firms, but again,... for this, you essentially feel like an undeserved tourist strolling through the campus of Harvard University, dreaming the unattainable fantasy of becoming ""one of them.""
3. Letting you off from work sharply at 6 PM, but do the math, people. You're spending 10 hours of Orwellian 1984 to spend 4-5 hours of freedom?

5. You get to become an expert on the Terminal, but let's be honest: if you were smart enough to go to investment banks or other financial firms, you get to use Bloomberg's Sales and Analytics people for your own use of becoming an expert on the Terminal.

"3358",130,"The Pros Large, diverse workforce with people from literally all over the world - you meet mostly really great characters but also some world class corporate duds. Very international working environment and exposure to international clients as you would expect. Free 'snacks' and drinks in a well-kitted pantry (though the novelty quickly wears off leaving you only with the bitter taste of a poor cup of coffee).... Training is in general quite good - but be ready for fast paced learning, where i.e. you are taught a condensed version of Portfolio theory in a day, and then are expected to sit an exam on what you've learned the following day at 8:00 am...not leaving you much time to absorb the knowledge, and inducing some university-style cramming. In that sense it helps a lot to come from a 'finance' background where you have studied the stuff before - but this is not essential as they spoon-feed you the knowledge to start with - many hires come from non-finance backgrounds. Competitive salary - especially for recent graduates (£37,250 base plus £4,000 performance related bonus). Finally, you'll learn how to use, and become an expert on using a terminal, where, if you are looking to kick start a career in Finance, this will be an invaluable addition to the CV.

"3550",153,"I worked as a Data Analyst within the Global Data department for several years. Overall I'd say this is a great place to work for those who want to simply collect their paychecks (pretty decent amount too) without all the stress often associated with similar salary range in any other firms. Keep calm and tag data, then you shall be rewarded with a peaceful and decent life. I have no idea how anyone can leave a 4- or... 5-star review of this place, but I am very happy for them that their experience working at Bloomberg was significantly better than mine. Here are some things I liked about working there:
- Free breakfast, lunch, and snack at the cafeteria - obligatory mentioning of the free food for the employees. I know it's cliche, and almost all past reviewers mentioned it, but it does save a lot of money for food. Don't expect anything too fancy, but hey, it's free. With that said, I should also mention that it's pretty sad for a workplace when almost everyone lists free food as their favorite part of their job.
- Very flexible hours and incredibly easy job  during my time at the firm, I never had to work late or come in during weekends/holidays. Most people come in after 8am and the office is deserted by 5pm. You only spend 2-3 hours each day actually doing your job (I agree with the person who called it dystopia  if you have to spend more than that, you should seriously reconsider your life), and are free to do anything you want (read the news, pretending to do work, etc) for the rest of the day. The job itself is incredibly easy, and I seriously doubt that you need a college degree to do any of our daily tasks. 
- Great benefits and decent salary  Bloomberg employees get some of the best benefits out there (health, dental, vision). You also get unlimited sick days on top of your 4 week paid vacation. I also think that the pay is pretty decent for what we do, at least for the NJ-based employees. Ive read some reviews here (perhaps they worked in NYC) and heard my colleagues regarding how they think they are underpaid compared to their friends who work for banks and other financial firms.  I disagree with them. For what we do and how much work we do, I think the pay is fair. Its pretty embarrassing to hear some of them comparing themselves to traders and PMs on the Street.
- *Some* great colleagues and constant collaboration  Like many other reviewers mentioned, you will meet some very bright colleagues in the firm. I also like that the company does a good job of promoting collaboration (both within the team/department and outside), so you can team up with smart people to work on interesting projects. The problem is that these people are rare, and they always end up leaving after several years because the job itself is nothing but repetitive and mindless. I have truly enjoyed working with some people during my time at the firm; I just wish I met them elsewhere so that we would work on something that actually mattered.
- High degree of freedom  most of the managers in the department are clueless and have no idea what is going on and what you are working on. This means that you have unbelievably high degree of freedom, and can get away with almost anything. You can literally not do any work for one full week and no one would say anything to you, so long as you remember to ask your managers how their weekend was, how their dogs are doing, how their kids did in their baseball/soccer game, etc. By the end of your first year, you will become an expert in small-talks and master the art of superficial smiles.","4.0"

"3610",161,"My pros fall into four key areas: the people, the space, the exposure to senior management, and the balance. 

The people: My co-workers are a great bunch of people, many of whom have become my close friends. It's a supportive environment that encourages collaboration -- and I know I can lean on my team when I need them. Plus, my colleagues are super smart and they make me laugh. Overall, Bloomberg employees are... very hard-working, and I respect that kind of work ethic.

The space: 731 Lex knocks it out of the park. There's no other office building in NYC like it! The building is always buzzing with energy (and the occasional celebrity).

Exposure to senior management: I am very thankful to be put on projects supporting the company's senior leaders. I feel respected when working with people levels above me, and most of the time, I feel as though my work is valued.

The balance: (Disclaimer: I imagine this is very dependent on who your manager is.) My boss is very understanding. If I need to leave early or work from home, I leave early or work from home. I can still manage work, school, and my social life. Granted, some nights I stay late to get my work done, but they serve a pretty delicious dinner at 8 PM, which helps.","4.0"

Career development programs:  Bloomberg offers a ton of classes for employees through a program called 'Bloomberg University'.  You can learn the in's and... out's of finance as well as take classes to increase your technical abilities in XML, Excel, and basic programming.  There are also courses to improve public speaking, conflict management other useful business/interpersonal skills.  

Volunteer Opportunities:  The volunteer programs at Bloomberg at top-notch and really one of the most impressive parts of the company.  There are employee 5k's, big brother reading programs, and even opportunities to help build homes with habitat for humanity.  The culture encourages participation and in many instances Bloomberg will even match personal donations to many causes.  

Diverse community of peers:  There is no real 'type' at Bloomberg and that seems to be an intentional part of the hiring practices to ensure diversity.  I've worked with men and women of all backgrounds and always encountered a respectful and thoughtful interaction between my peers.  A decent HR program ensures that people act like professionals and even minor issues are quickly addressed.  I definitely feel a sense of pride to work for an inclusive community that encourages diversity.","5.0"
