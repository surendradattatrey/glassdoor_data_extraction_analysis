"1","As a software developer in a finance oriented company, you are treated like a commodity.  The company is actively pursuing offshoreing, outsourcing, whatever you want to call it.  Upper management seems only focused on increasing the perception of value to investors, while neglecting the nuts and bolts of the everyday operations.  Famous quote from the CEO: ""In real estate there are three essential things: location,... location, location.  In our business, it's data, data, data.""  But many employees are left wondering why the actions dont match the words.  Not much feeling of comeradery or team/company spirit."
"2","Don't kill the golden goose.  You cant downsize and offshore your way to success.  Stop thinking like an investment banker, and start thinking like a leader.  People probably dont really expect corporate leadership to be totally honest, so stop trying so hard to convince us of that."
"3","Management blames underlings for failure. No incentive to improve business processes."
"4","Take leadership role seriously"
"5","No sense of purpose for where the company is headed, few growth prospects, little to no skill development, generally static work environment, lots of bureaucracy, lots of busy work and work for the sake of work; the fact that the industry is small leaves long-term employees at a disadvantage seeking positions elsewhere, because the skill set is unique and does not easily apply to other fields."
"6","Transition issues are understandable given the recent string of acquisitions and restructuring. More of a problem is the lack of vision communicated to employees. Lots of fancy words about growth and change don't make up for the fact that priorities are not communicated to employees. If someone is asked to work on a project, it is necessary to communicate what the end goal is: who will see the project, and how the... company and/or the department will benefit. This is not the case. Projects come up one after another, with little of direction or purpose; because of a missing compass of priorities, useless but urgent projects often take precedence over more important ones."
"7","Unfortunately, the company is a dysfunctional organization that rewards unconditional allegiance, especially at higher levels. The result is a lot of emphasis on upward management, a lot of energy wasted on polishing appearances. Most of the sales force is pretty clueless about Barra products."
"8","Good luck."
"9","Communication across the company could be improved; sometimes there is redundancy between groups that could be eliminted or smoothed out if there was better communication."
"10","Senior management is good at making sure the company doesn't do anything to exorbitant or rash, but continues to grow.  They should continue to do this."
"11","Inconsistent  leadership

Limited opportunities for growth"
"12","Stay focuced on the big picture. Micromanagement will not earn you respect nor produce the best results from your group."
"13","not always very intellectually challenging"
"14","create some whacky products haha"
"15","It's a competitive environment - you are expected to contribute above expectations and take charge of your own development and career."
"16","Great leadership."
"17","The Rockville office is being closed, so long time employees are being let go left and right with no option to transfer to other offices.  Management will tell you that you're work is appreciated and that you're doing a good job but them lay you off in the next breath.  There are no opportunities for advancement and the work is very tedious."
"18","Stop lying about the Rockville office."
"19","Loose and unprofessional management. Some key management roles are filled by people with poor risk management knowledge and very much into the politics."
"20","Be honest and be fair."
"21","Lack of transparency around compensation
HR is slow
The company has been acquiring other companies almost non-stop for close to 3 years, so there is a constant feeling of chaos 'due to the transition'. 
Long-term employees are scared for their jobs so morale is low in some offices
Changing roles requires a lot of persistence, patience and support from your manager"
"22","Devise a strategy for keeping your experienced workers, as well as young talent
Make employees feel valued
Push managers to give regular feedback and provide incentives/rewards for good performance"
"23","Not a particularly professional management that seems to be driven by emotions rather than by strategy and focus. Communication is very poor and essentially non-existing, unless one is in privileged circles (it is so bad that it can affect one's work)."
"24","Treat your subordinates with more respect and try to understand what they do.
Use their skills and strengths better, share information and delegate responsibilities. 
Be more transparent and straightforward. 
Motivate and create professional growth opportunities."
"25","Micromanagement can be overbearing at times. There is a lot of emphasis on internal meetings which can take up a lot of time and leave little time for anything else."
"26","Management can try not micromanaging their teams and let each individual think and act as owners."
"27","A small number of insiders seem to be in charge at the top. Filled with people turned spineless and afraid of their superiors (and believe they should like it this way). Focus on a “meritocracy” culture to reward compensation but a competitive non-entrepreneur attitude is a result."
"28","The best companies are not run by dictators or their sons."
"29","Low salary
Limited possibilities of career advancement"
"30","Please, increase compensation package!"
"31","Work-life balance different for each different department.  If you work for a boss with no life, expect to have no life yourself."
"32","Going public was a bad idea for employees.  A culture as strong as RMG cannot survive when it has to answer to private equity and executive boards."
"33","- strategy of offshoring creates insecurity among US staff and creates need to be available around the clock for meetings in various time zones"
"34","- Engage more with all levels of staff to understand ground level challenges
- Examine strategy to hire in emerging market regions as it is creating stress among US staff as folks have to work around th clock to accomodate meetings in budapest, HK, Mumbai and Monterrey"
"35","Limited information about the frequent M&As."
"36","Integration is key to building a successful product and service. Integrate all your pieces first before adding new parts to the puzzle."
"37","* The financial aspects of risk management, at least in the Berkeley office, is overwhelmed with the day-to-day necessities of keeping a data processing infrastructure going.  There is not much time left for financial analysis, if that is what you are looking to learn.
* Management does not understand how the IT systems work, so there can be a lot of misunderstanding.
* The company is outsourcing a lot of its work... to offshore locations, so if you are American and want to stay that way, good luck."
"38","* Spend more time trying to learn how the systems you oversee actually work, and a little less time in meetings."
"39","- The Barra business (risk models) is a constant source of frustration. The firm didn't manage the acquisition of Barra well and is still struggling although some signs of improvement are visible.
- Management style is top-down, prescriptive and formalistic. Won't suit engineers and quants who look for creative freedom. Management loves global reporting and controlling. It feels like they distrust their employees... and constantly feel a need to rein-in and micro-manage. 
- This isn't your place if you are a programmer or researcher looking to work with the latest tools and push the boundaries. Working at MSCI feels much more like working for a big accounting firm than like working for Google.
- The firm has embarked on an ambitious offshoring strategy. If you are looking for a job in Mumbai, Monterrey, or Budapest you're fine. If you look for a job in the US, expect trouble ahead."
"40","- Sort out what you really want with the Barra business. Stop over-announcing and under-delivering.
- If you're serious about business growth, you have to trust your middle managers and delegate more."
"41","The pay could be better.  The bonus structure can make up for lack in pay, but it all depends on which part of the business you work for."
"42","Don't sell this company.  You have a great thing going here and with the loyalty you have built up, the sky is the limit."
"43","Senior management is keen on cost cutting. You should not expect to get good bonus. 

The merging with Risk Metrics introduces many uncertainties."
"44","Do you really want to keep good ppl ?"
"45","Unfortunately there is no business travel. Some merger turmoil."
"46","MSCI should be careful not to kill off the RiskMetrics culture of meritocracy and flexibility"
"47","-  Lack of management focus
- Ad hoc style of product development and delivery
- Underinvestment in content development groups"
"48","In regards to the merger with MSCI:
- Please keep the free and innovative culture
- Building a world-class analytics shop requires on-shore research and development talent."
"49","too intense with ex ms background

- unispiring management; 
- absolutely no oversight over the actions of the lowest-level management;
- very disappointing base salaries in comparison to market rates;
- annual bonuses are paid out at random, since no objective metrics are used to evaluate performance;
- since there is no oversight and no objective metrics are used, promotions happen at random;
-... lack of true long-term strategy (it seems to change as often as the management);
- questionable hiring practices;"
"52","RMG managers always talk about people being the most important asset of the company. I would go even further, people (their knowledge, skills, and experience) are the only asset that the company has. An inability to manage this asset is shocking. There is no managing going on at all most of the time. It is just all totally haphazard. The company can't retain talent. It appears to me that RMG retains and promotes the... mediocre (at best)."
"53","The salary is not very good"
"54","Too much meetings"
"55","Opportunity to move up can be dangled like a carrot for years.  Little respect for personal time.  Pay does not seem connected to performance."
"56","MSCI Barra attracts talented people, but is unable to keep them.  There would be a large increase in satisfaction from clients if employees were more consistent and knowledgeable people were provided incentive to stay."
"57","Some very senior managers show no loyalty to staff.
Some emerging markets offices never receive visits from senior managers.
Loyalty is not evenly rewarded.
Promotions at the highest levels are motivated for reasons other than merit-based."
"58","TREAT employees more decently.  TRAIN them more consistently.  TRUST them to do their jobs."
"59","Culture of managing people by fear
Blame is the key way to approach subordinates
Management is extremely secretive about its plans and next moves
Poor bonus compensation
Cost cutters, only growing in emerging markets
Poor career prospects for long term."
"60","Sell the company to a bigger one. After all people do not matter."
"61","Most managers work on perception, and that may lead to unfair treatment of employees. Not all groups have similar requirements for promotion or compensation bonuses etc. so that can be demoralising if you are at not in the 'right group, or the more favored projects'.
Also the whole cost cutting thing is getting too far, the Berkeley office has been shrinking and everyone's expected to almost work on a 24hr cycle to... keep up with the offshore offices."
"62","value the hardwork your employees put in regardless of whether they are in your most favorite projects or not."
"63","the office can get chaotic with recent acquisitions, people are still unsure of the direction the company is going to go"
"64","better career advancement, stop being so secretive about employee compensation, have a clear goal for the future, and keep up the morale"
"65","Some management need formal training. Acquisitions have not helped with clarity in direction."
"66","Formal leadership training program for all managers and team leaders."
"67","At times, RMG needs more strategic business focus and leadership.  While we have grown enormously over our history, I believe we could have achieved even more if we had more focus and organizational clarity."
"68","At this point (about to be sold to MSCI), the question is somewhat moot.  So, for the new management, preserve the important parts of RMG culture as you integrate and change the business."
"69","underperformers not properly encouraged to work harder; currently going through buy-out exploration with MSCI (see MSCI review to find out what this may mean to the RiskMetrics culture)"
"70","general advice to management, current and future - listen to the feedback from your employees - with a staff of PhDs, MBAs, etc., maybe they might have something to contribute"
"71","What innovation?
No career advancement opportunities
Products are stale like day old bread
Stingy on education reimbursements
Middle management is completely useless"
"72","Need to improve synergy with ISS and CFRA products."
"73","The so called work life balance = some people work around the clock, while others work 9 to 5 yet spending time in game room."
"74","Nothing matters now as it'll soon be the leadership of MSCI. It is a good decision of the leaders to have fun now after making enough money."
"75","There's lot of scope for  improvement of benefits. No formal management or leadership training is provided. Work life balance is preached but the practice is not encouraged"
"76","Out of box thinking should be encouraged more. Innovation and increasing efficiency should be part of the daily job and managers should be rewarded for these activities."
"77","There is no pre-defined career path at RiskMetrics actually means that (for most employees) there is no career path.

Pay is not high compared to what an employee has to offer."
"78","No so much coments really. It has been acquired by msci and more than 80 percent top management will be leaving."
"79","There isn't much room for growth both horizontally or vertically; cross functional move is difficult as the functions are speaded out worldwide and there is no systematic internal recruiting;"
"80","Management needs to focus more on putting the right people in the right role and define the roles better; the roles within an organization shouldn't be static and it's the managment's responsibility to plan strategically to redefine these roles and match them with the right people to maximize efficiency"
"81","Lack of career growth
Lack of creativity
Lack of organization when it comes to planning and getting things done
Everything is done in a cookie-cutter fashion

Uncompetitive base salaries. 
Disappointing bonuses.
Limited learning opportunities (at least on the corporate governance side).
Toxic atmosphere.
Promotions/bonuses motivated by reasons other than performance.
Talent or hard work are not appreciated. 
Low morale - most ISS employees are looking for a new job these days. 
Uncertain future."
"86","Treat people with more respect, be more transparent, and inform better.
Get some kind of strategy and try to stick with it for a while. 
MSCI - fire the current RMG management, and get some new people -> the current management is so bad that no matter who you hire, it can only get better."
"87","too many reports and meetings, you'll have to get approval for almost everything."
"88","nothing"
"89","Too many meetings.  Too many generals.  Prefer to throw people at a need rather than technology which leads to too many opinions and analysis paralysis."
"90","Improve technology.  Stop micro managing.  Trust your employees.  Get rid of deadwood as there is a lot of it.  Keep improving products."
"91","too structured and top down, not a fun place to work. top management has a strong culture of cost cutting."
"92","put more balance between cost cutting and employee satisfaction and career development; also need careful balance between sales culture and research culture"
"93","Not enough trust.
Too hard to get approval and/or sign off on work.
Bad communication.
Very difficult to progress if you don't associate with the ""right"" people = extremely inconsistent treatment of employees.
Staff turnover is high."
"94","Listen to employee feedback and make changes accordingly.  Cut communication blockers.  Remember that employee satisfaction saves money and dissatisfied employees cost money."
"95","Too bureaucratic and process oriented that many times it becomes an obstacle to progress.
Saving money, cutting cost and greater profit margins seems to be the main concern for the company. 
Focused on outsourcing current and new roles to developing markets."
"96","a company such as MSCI is made up of brains, people that is. Need to focus more on employees satisfaction and a whole lot less on cost cutting."
"97","Not enough recognition to outstanding performers.   The compensation is not very competitive compare to the market.  Frequent merger and acquistions intimediate job security."
"98","The management should provide more training and opportunities to the junior staff to help them develop a sense of belonging since turnover rate is quite high."
"99","heavy on the paperwork to get any training, travel or expenses approved- it needs to go up 3 or 4 levels of management!
not a lot of space for people with a good idea to 'run with it'-- everything needs to be pre-approved and scrutinized, meaning the company isn't exactly nimble and can't support thought leadership"
"100","develop a real HR strategy and some form of talent management. eventually, staff with some ambition will get tired of being process monkeys and will look for work where initiative and a focus on personal development are rewarded."
"101","lots of turnover at times."
"102","keep employees informed of what you are working on."
"103","poor morale and high turnover
heavy cost cutting
lack of direction and vision from management
no career path and training
not compensated or rewarded for accomplishments
no accountability"
"104","Value your employees and compensate them accordingly. A continental breakfast a couple of times a year and your words of praise are meaningless and often more insulting than motivational."
"105","This company actively promotes a culture of dis-trust and opaqueness. There is far too much red-tape to get your job done -- from travelling, to purchasing resources (even just a book), to hiring -- every decision, big or small, must go through governmental levels of bureaucracy (in fact it may take less to pass a bill in the US Congress than to travel in this company).

The Senior Management is utterly clueless... about what it means to be a software company. ""Data, data, data"" will get you only so far -- the rest must be made up in offerings and services. But, if MSCI isn't willing to invest heavily in writing that software it will fall to its competitors.

As mentioned before, your office mates tend to be good people. However, most of the talent in this company has come through acquisition or junior new hires. So, your mates don't tend to stick around long -- after they've found out what this company is *really* like.

The Senior Management tends to say one thing and do another."
"106","The bottom-line is always something that must be considered, but there must be balance. You can please the investors by constantly cutting the bottom-line, but eventually you'll start cutting away at vital organs and the company will die. Quick! Turn the ship around before she sinks; don't make the same types of colossal mistakes that sank the Titanic."
"107","Expenses are scrutinized heavily and make it a barrier for being productive.
Middle management is ineffective, too many meetings, too much posturing, less real effective work done."
"108","While there is good communication by the CEO, execution by middle management is lacking."
"109","The company is getting larger and larger and it is easy to get lost in the shuffle.  As it grows there is more red tape."

  Failure to promote.
  Top Performers rarely compenstated.
  Wallstreet Hours for non-wallstreet pay.

Inept  Middle/Senior Management rarely fired and rewarded only for cost cutting rather than productivity improvement

Lack of Job Security given Mgmt pursuing cost-cutting outsource strategy.

Cultural difference stemming from MSCI buyout of Barra.  Led to a mass exodus of people... in Berkeley to other firms. The brain drain didn't help much in terms of morale.

Can't imagine what the RiskMetrics Buyout will be like.

There is only one Aegis."
"114","Create a strategy to retain junior/entry level employees via Career Ladders or better compensation arrangements.
Possibly create a rotational program for entry level canditaes

Save money by laying off Senior Managers who don't understand the infrastructure and its requirements rather than Outsourcing."
"115","A toxic environment filled with in-fighting and turf wars amidst senior and middle management 
No accountability, no stability, no transparency, no performance standards, no trust. Everyone says the right thing but not much gets done except a lot of running around in circles  
Poor compensation"
"116","learn to trust"
"117","It can be a depressing and oppressive place if you like ideas, if you are creative, or feel that the management does not always know best."
"118","You may lean a thing or two by listening to employees, and not only to those directly under you."
"119","The salary cannot compare with that in i bank."
"120","Spend more resources on training.
Sales is important. However the knowledge and skill of the employees keeps the company's leadership in the industry."
"121","Middle to senior management left so much to be desired.  Friends were promoted or favorites, instead of those actually working.  Often times, junior members on the team were left on their own to figure out things instead of getting explanation or guidance from more senior members."
"122","I noticed most of the senior management that was in place when I worked there have left.  Their job titles and apparent roles had changed quite a bit.  I would advise the current management to value their employees and listen to their ideas."
"123","La charge de travail peut parfois s'avérer trop lourde."
"124","Very procedural by nature, not very open about structural changes, things communicated to every employee without much opportunity for two-way exchange."
"125","Hear all employee's suggestions and ideas. Reduce the bureaucratic process - it can stifle creativity and growth, both of which are vital for the growth of the company!"
"126","Lack of cultural investment in outside-the-box thinking and employee engagement.  ""Efficiency"" as a buzzword for systematic removal of creativity.  Highly controlled environment with emphasis on making every peg fit in the round hole.  One way communication from management, lack of transparency."
"127","Especially after the acquisition of RiskMetrics, MSCI strongly underestimated the cultural issues of fusing a creative and less bureaucratic workforce with a systematic, autocratic approach.  As such, many legacy employees are left disgruntled, and existing employees are frustrated.  Engagement with employees is the only way to effectively understand their value.  Ultimately, management would have to either 1.)... change the culture at the firm if it values the more creative aspects of its industry, or 2.) remove employees who have cultural differences."
"128","no trust to employee, 
no support from management"
"129","Needs to do a better job at keeping morale high and offices that were acquired during acquisition"
"130","Micro management, unwarranted prejudice shown by managers, little scope for growth and tendency to get into comfort zone"

Time-off discouraged between March-June
One person expected to perform the duties of... several employees or an entire team because of cost cutting
Talented, experienced employees are expected to train new hires and are then laid off"
"133","Talk to current employees to get an honest opinion of their work experience at MSCI.  Ask for feedback.  I'm sure you would be amazed at the response.  Everyone has something to say.  Who will listen?"
"134","no career growth opportunity in the company"
"135","Focus on revenue and growth, but not personal agenda"
"136","Very slow growth within the firm. Sometimes, the work you do is like a back-office job which deals with simply extracting data and presenting it on an excel sheet."
"137","Encourage rapid career growth within the firm. Currently, the company is growing quickly but people are not promoted very often which leads to a lot of dissatisfaction."
"138","No work/life balance.  Good performances are not rewarded.  Career growth is not provided to good employees with excellent performances."
"139","Management does not try to reward or retain good employees; as a result, there is high turnover and overall dissatisfaction among employees."

"142","the way of treating people is too tough now"

"147","so far so good. But a long way to go. we need attract more talents from business schools. We need more junior people in the company."
"148","- high turnover which leads to low morale among employees
- limited learning / growth opportunities
- too cost conscious"
"149","MSCI strategy to create shareholder value is to build low cost operations in low cost countries like India, Mexico, Budapest and Oklahoma.    There is a lack of trust in staff.   Onerous process driven culture inhibits creativity.     Seniority resides with former Morgan Stanley guys who have no new ideas and aren't going anywhere.     Overall it's a depressing environment."

"160","Try to make sure you have appropriate resources in order to complete the jobs without rushing them out the door."
"161","There is limited potential for professional growth and there are not that many perks for employees. Also, the tendency is to lead people into becoming very specialized in a specific area, to the point where certain groups seem isolated form the rest of the business units."
"162","Very unprofessional, very poor pay as per your qualifications,"
"163","No respect from sinior management.  Lack of communication.  What sinor management decides goes no matter how wrong it is.  You are nothing but a number to them.  All they care about is the buttom line.  I miss the good old days of RMG :("
"164","Communicate and trust your employees and you will find that they will work twice as hard as if you keep yelling and screaming at them as you do now.

"171","Slow to make decisions, management can be distant, career development needs to improve now the company has grown - little real high impact investment here. 

Management top heavy with Men, particularly men whose wives stay at home, hence little clue about what it is to be a working mom"
"172","Pay more attention to your people, less to internal meetings with other managers"
"173","I did not learn anything new."
"174","It should implement a training program."
"175","Senior management care only about themselves. Local office heads and senior veterans not motivated to really help underlings.  Often make it known they despise their role.

in tricky market we know not where we're going. Fragmented data, models and meetings.

Clannish, devisive behavior interfering with client mtgs, conference participation and trust.

Favoritism, etc.

Guidance and accountability seriously... lacking in the Coverage, Project Management and Facilities units. Particularly in the New York and SF Bay offices.  Good luck getting any emails answered.  Or seeing any consistent meetings out of them.

Outsourcing so much that we've chopped off our own feet and it's a challenge to go forward. Especially without vision, communication, trust and fairness."
"176","There's a lot we would like to give, but we've seen others shot down for nicely doing so.  What is clear Is that leadership needs to change and vision needs to be clarified.  After that, professionalism re-instilled in what used to be a great company.  Pay attention to your product formation teams,  new sales and upsells.  Also to local office management and HR,  to help with these areas.  We can really hit walls... when we need basic questions answered.  That wastes even more time and productivity.  Also look at who actually has shown up to work through the years instead of working remotely and not findable.   Then keep telling us where we're going so we can actually do our jobs."
"177","Work is routinary. Mostly it is about data gathering, similar to market data vendors like reuters. Work involves a lot of IT, and very little finance. Most jobs not relevant to CFA, FRM or other finance/investment certifications. Company reducing cost. Wont pay OT on work on Sunday, but instead gives time off on week day."

"179","Most decisions made with only cost in mind. If they can get it done cheaper outsde the U.S,  it goes to Eastern Europe or Asia, and if that means it takes two days to get a simple communication done (like a manager answering a question), they don't care. Discussion about improvements to products always end with ""We don't have the resources."" Layoffs happen every year and are done by a formula, with no attention to... quality of work."

"181","Career growth limited due to flat structure.
Very limited scope of IT professional to grow"

"185","Lot of in-house applications which is ok but lead to random bugs. Tech decisions are all done out of the cadre in London while the implementation is done by a team in Budapest.  Service Desk based in Mumbai can often lead to frustration.  Hope you're looking for a position with the indexing side, otherwise look out."
"186","At least one local office support person would help a lot, i've seen people be without a computer for 3 days at times.  Cost cutting of personnel leads to higher turnover on those thinking they're next."

In addition, the work is becoming a routine and not challenging when data was automatized..

Hrd to get anything done when the good people are gone.  Ones staying are those entitled and paid to do very little while making it seem like they do a lot.  Government and Dept of Labor probably should look at this place over the past couple years.  Especially New York and... Berkeley offices. Some crazy unspervised staff. Jungle ambiance.  A lot of politics.  Paranoia.  Backstabbing. Really bad moods and stressed out groups.  Good workers at all levels are leaving for the competition. No real teamwork or consistent results."
"259","Try going a year without salary like others did during the rough times.  Put that money into the company and salares.  And during that time keep a few more people nearby their teams.  At all levels.  Take a look at who really does work, not just who has connections to your neighborhood or colleges.  Treat people better.  There's still time to regain some losses."

Start with poor senior leadership and add a highly political, paranoid, secretive and distrustful culture where backstabbing and little respect for the individual is standard operating procedure. Then throw in a complete lack of resources and the need to work 24/7 in order to try and accomplish the simplest task with co-workers and vendors in emerging (i.e. cheaper) markets, and you have a... totally dysfunctional and toxic environment that smart, committed and talented professionals will want to avoid."
"265","There are some good members of the management team at MSCI. These managers, however, are outnumbered by the poor managers. CEO Henry Fernandez needs to clean house starting at the top."

"293","Spend more time with the company, less chasing revenue growth."
"294","The culture and soul of the company is lacking.  Make no mistake, it's a corporate environment with strict security and compliance guidelines.  At times it can be stifling. Also, the perpetual chasing of countries with lower cost employees doesn't help the morale of those in developed markets.  You can either hate it or get ahead of the curve.  The company pays decent salaries but it is by no means generous with the... perks.  Flying internationally in coach for 15 hours gets old.  It's possible to fly business class but good luck finding that for under $5k as required by policy.  As I said, it has more of the traditional corporate culture. 

Also, the Sales teams clearly run the company.  It's probably like this at many other companies but I don't find it a positive characteristic of working at MSCI."
"295","Continue to find ways to bring teams together.  Offsites or other meaningful investments to bring teams together would go a long way. Globally dispersed teams makes building meaningful professional relationships and rapport much harder.  It's just not as much fun coming to work if you never see your co-workers."

Severley technically deficient managers esp in project managing.  Severely untrained  other managers/officers in general office management, who  are... stubborn and stressed, at times, even abrupt and unpofessional to outside and inside.  A lot of bad promotions past couple years, coming where politically calculated.  Hard to really see how the company can go forward with so much bad behavior and morale. Unrealistic deadlines in general for new product, and with terrible home office management and lack of consistency, even crazier atmosphere."

"316","Blame game, Machiavellian politics between groups and individuals. 
Corporate culture is almost the opposite of teamwork; rather, people try to CYA all the time. 
There is a negative view permeating the company of “failure” be it actual or perceived. People are therefore understandably afraid to try new things, do green-field research and proof-of-concept projects, etc because of the risk of failure, which is... inherent in these sorts of endeavors.
Zero focus or value placed on career development; people essentially get stuck in their role with no opportunity or catering toward improving their skills or moving to higher levels on their career path.
Non-technical managers hired to oversee technical functions leads to poor decisions, political battles, disenfranchised and frustrated staff.
Focus on cost-cutting and maintaining margin means innovation does not thrive, since the focus is always on feature development that is promised to bring in new customers.  
Lots of jobs transferred offshore, which makes software engineering efforts difficult to complete and very inefficient."
"317","If satisfied with how the company is operating then don’t change anything; however, if unsatisfied, be prepared to embrace significant cultural and operational change that will make everyone, up to the senior level of management, uncomfortable at best."

"321","Not too many opportunities for career development."
"322","Top heavy structure, with the critical junior functions scattered.  Just a few of the lower levels in home offices.  But mostly frozen by paranoia and politics.  Only those folks affiliated by schools and/or clubs of senior managers appear to be given (too much) liberty.  Stagnating office ambiances, especially in California. Frequently traveling or outside meetings take priority.. New York not far behind.  Indeed... the home offices seem to be in rivalry of a strange sort.  With little appreciation over the years for anyone who has tried to call attention to problem ops or staff.  So the Company is run a la Boiler Room style, with the club aspect, then token quota hires protected.  Then the alienated, overworked outsiders, who can easily be targeted, are left to do the work of many and not allowed advances very much.   And horrible HR; frequently absent and easily irate. Given to rudeness and error, especially when new staff joins. Really bad hires and practices over years. With little room for correction.  Or coherent, timely product creation.  Uninterested, often irrational senior staff. And they too can be conveniently absent.  Newer packages stalled. Competition catching up."

"325","Realign the salary structure."
"326","Management likes to dangle the promise of a raise or promotion over you without delivering, or only halfway delivering. There are several here who describe getting a promotion, but not a raise that should come with it. Communication is abysmal, particularly inter-departmental. And empire building practices have gone on for many years, leaving the company very segmented and a refusal to improve processes. Too many... jobs being pushed to Developing Markets without regard to quality of work. Metrics setup for helpdesk that a toddler could game."
"327","Take care of Developed markets and pay raises as well as Developing Markets."
"328","RiskMetrics was never a very large company in terms of headcount, job turnover was relatively low for the industry, and opportunities for advancement were consequently few.  Management structures were reorganized frequently, but never to very great effect.  Sometimes it seemed like they were just reshuffling chairs.  There was a core group of people with a lot of equity who were effectively a protected class, and... over the years a few of them were warehoused in ineffective roles just to keep them around.  There was a lot of gossip and back-biting, which could sometimes amount to a meaningful distraction."
"329","I still consider Ethan Berman the smartest and most effective senior executive I've ever worked for.  He cared about every employee of the firm, and demonstrated it by his actions in matters large and small.  He treated everyone with respect and integrity, made sure that the overall mission of the firm was clearly communicated, and that everyone understood how their role fit into that mission.  Moreover, he made... sure that everyone shared in the firm's financial success at least to some extent, so that every employee felt that they had some skin in the game.  I wish more companies were like RiskMetrics in that respect, and that more CEOs were like Ethan."

1) At the time of recruitment, they will use the words like data structures, algorithms, highly multi threaded applications and low latency systems. In reality you find nothing interesting there. 
2) They always work in fire fighting mode with little planning.
3) They are not interested in improving upon the way software development is done....
4) Entire IT Data management department  is nothing but a extended PRODUCTION SUPPORT which doesn't need good software developers.
5) People are not treated with respect.
6) Higher management is very closed minded."
"340","1) Please tell the truth at the time of recruitment that candidate is being hired for PRODUCTION SUPPORT only. You do not have any software development opportunities. 
2) In meetings, Please do not tell that you planning to make this company like Google in terms of software development, when you clearly know  that you do not have any plans for the same."
"341","People are made to work days and nights without resting, anytime something goes wrong, although at bonus time, that is quickly forgotten. Management never backs the employees because they are all scared for their own jobs.  There are only a handful of women, because they RARELY choose any woman that is interviewed, and women are not promoted, so if you are a woman, expect that you will never move up (even after they... were asked, and have taken on the additional responsibility of the position and they are already doing the job).  The employee surveys every year show that the employees are VERY dissatisfied and do not trust the management.  I wonder if they will ask us to fill out those surveys next year... I doubt it."
"342","Fair employment practices would be a good start.  Get rid of the ""good ole boys"" club mentality and hire some brilliant women to change the environment for the better.  Provide promotions to ALL employees when they take the position - this is such an abuse of your people."
"343","Culture and mass exodus of IPD"
"344","Comparing working experience with competitors, MSCI is the worse. 
For 5 years, I have been working in different IT departments in various managerial roles. There were shades of differences, though all were hectic, toxic and unpredictable.  
The most expensive people bought, but noone gives a dam on their opinion. 

Management: 
Top management has a sick view of how to manage business/departments/people likely... from a warehouse from the 80s. They prefer to manage business based on feelings/presumptions. Departments managed by status quo-leaders without clear roles & responsibilities. It is the heaven of blame and conspiracy. 
Business leadership: -seems to be incompetent to do the very basics like ROI, TCO. For certain units, that would mean split of from MSCI. Client management is done via  ineffective, rigid and non-transparent ""habits"". Zero internal standards. 
IT mgmt: The company has changed its IT mgmt completely and still all issues remained so these  are rooting from the very top. 
Service mgmt doesn't exist. 
People mgmt looks like as if the golden rules of a leadership cookbook would have been turned around. Trust, motivation, support, transparency and responsibility are myth. 
There were poor attempts of external audits to move out from the swamp, though all ended up with a comedy of doing nothing. 
The last 2 surveys resulted ~20% satisfactory amongst IT staff. ...which company can afford to do nothing on such a low score?

Racism:
People working in Berkeley/NY/Geneva are the first class citizen and can do/screw literally anything without consequences, unlike the other offices, which are count as the ""lower class"" crowd. Senior managers are not even hiding this fact. 
First class leaders systematically keep second class citizens in fear, looking their entry/exit time and NOT looking actual performance. Often undermining professional reputations to keep their status quo. Roles are unclear and blurred. 
Innovative ideas are killed in the first place . 

Systems:
The previous IT mgmt screwed the design of the current systems, therefore availability, sustainability and reliability is worsening. The new mgmt in general seems to be incompetent to cope with this challenge. They brought over 100 consultants (the entire IT is around ~700 FTE), screwing the budget and therefore could not staff up the operations."
"345","Time to retire, folks ..."
"346","Some employees lack essential communication skills. Management does not always seek input from front line employees."

"349","Keep up the good work. Cafeteria should have more options"

Then I’ve seen so many valuable people leaving because it is so hard to get anything done due to bureaucracy processes or because new management does not value all the after hours work, and force them to come in a fix schedule AND work at 3 am or over weekends, holidays or whenever they are called.

I cannot count the number of times that someone actually YELLED at me, cussed me out,... slammed doors, stood OVER me as intimidation, and sabotoged my success (even at the company's expense).  I escalated my concerns (as did others), but management did not respond, and later denied that they knew.  HR didn't respond either - even when blatent abuse and discrimination was reported. The only option for many was to leave or to put up with the hostile environment and the retaliation from blowing the whistle.  The environment is always unstable as well.  I had far more managers than I had years with the company, and it felt like I was moved to a different desk each time someone sneezed.

"492","Understand that fear is the  only motivator.  Employees are afraid to answer ""confidential"" surveys with truthful feedback.

There are pockets of managers who will never promote a woman , so if you have stats that show women promoted... evaluate the groups where that has NEVER happened.  You may deny it, but it's terrible.  Life away from this... company is significantly different.  I was always treated with respect in professional environments before this company, and since I left.

"560","I joined MSCI as a part of a an acquisition. While initially excited to join a larger firm with ostensibly greater resources, I found that over time my group and by extension my job was increasing burdened with bureaucracy. By the time I left, it was quite difficult to actually get things done, as over 70% of my time was occupied by figuring out how to obtain and then chasing down the approvals for any given task.... Part of this is the nature of dealing with highly sensitive, market moving financial data. However it became apparent that more and more folks were afraid to make a decision for fear of making the wrong decision and then subsequently getting hammered by upper management. As a result, doing the actual work contained in my job description became secondary and thus very dissatisfying near the end of my tenure. 

I would also note that MSCI is at its core a data firm. And because data can essentially be moved anywhere there is a persistent and ongoing effort to arbitrage labor costs and move them to lower cost offices."

-Want you to get a designation (CFA, FMP, etc), yet only back one attempt per test. Rest of industry knows how hard these tests are and backs multiple attempts usually.
-There is no company culture, and morale about the company is low because management reats lower level so poorly (communication not being consistent/clear, cheap) and because of asinine internal processes"
"574","-Care more about your employees than Wall Street's expectations. It is obvious that you (the board and management) are doing everything you can to juice stock holdings at the expense of lower-level employees and growth.

"604","Nothing specific as of noe. Looks ok"
"605","Staff are culled on a regular basis.  It should always be kept in mind that MSCI's loyalty is to the bottom line, not to the employee.  If your current perceived value to the company is less than your current compensation, you will be at risk of termination, regardless of your tenure or your breadth/depth of knowledge."
"606","If you want employees to be loyal to the company, you need the employees to feel like the company has their back.  I don't think this is currently a common sentiment."
"607","Won't learn anything about financial markets. Totally avoid joining EDO (EDM) department... Cost cutting is at next level.. Not a single employee in this department is happy in working here"
"608","Too much into cost cutting. Especially even after year on year growing revenues..  senior management don't care about employees"

"639","Keep working on the environment and improve some specific programs around promotions and work load."
"640","Mid Managers here are not concerned with employees career. They themselves do not know what is next or they acting like they do not know. In any way loss of employee (subordinate).  Surprised when HR keeps sending the emails discuss your career with your manager and managers are blank what to discuss.

They won't take time to discuss or even consider the employee's growth, even after we showing interest or asking... how to grow. We keep waiting for growth in anticipation that next year it will be considered. 

Even after applying for role change, they wont trust internal people and bring outsiders, and will not give proper reason for rejection.I am in a team where strict hierarchy is followed. One have to tell concern to immediate manager. What if immediate manager is only creating problems as his manager is sitting in other city and timezone who never try to take feedback from juniors how the middle management is and upon we telling upfront of what is going on which he cannot see sitting away from the team, it went in vain as his manager is not even interested in problems of juniors, sitting in other city which is actually his own team away from him.  

Person will be loaded with ample of work with no work life balance however they wont be considered for future growth in a team. 

If you want to grow, this is not a place. Stay only if you are satisfied person in whatever you doing, without any challenges. Have seen people holding  years in same position.

Another cons is lack of technology. The processes are so much manual.  They spend hundred of thousands on partying or internal pamphlets etc, but while spending on technologies, they say no money. Ideas of employees are only heard, but no help in putting into action as there is no money. Sad."
"641","Sr. managers (MDs and above) must start taking skip level unbiased feedback on a regular basis to find out what is going on at bottom level and how the middle level is manupulating and whether they are fair in their decision. Do not bring HR as they too act biased. 
Company should think on employees career path guidance and technology improvements.  Making career mobility policy is not enough, one should follow the... same.

Create opportunities for subordinates instead of loosing them. They are happy to stay if given a good role and position."
"642","Middle managers do not know how to manage people and make it more difficult for them. Global heads of regions fight against each other to have more visibility and there is no coherence among the employees - everyone is against each other"
"643","Make sure you are able to identify good talent and get rid of managers who are immature and do not do their work properly."
"644","Flat structure may result in slow growth."

"651","Keep focused on quality of product instead of timeline of delivery although its important but so does quality."
"652","Lot of blame shifting, passing the buck, and credit hogging. Often prone to extreme levels of micro management. Leaders in offshore centres are seldom able to put forth the grievances of their teams to the management, which largely sits out of onshore locations. Instead, the focus is often on stirring the pot with petty office politics and wanton displays of favouritism. The company might be a favoured recruiter for... onshore roles, but offshore centres leave a lot to be desired."
"653","A general shake up to inculcate a stronger sense of ownership across the organisation."
"654","Lack of professional management, data structure"

training is not well established"
"672","Not organized with corporate services moves around offices.  Interferes with sales.  Hard to update info and present to clients when work spaces can be  chaotic and no great guidance from management.  There's also a defensiveness when trying to clear up spaces.  And it's supported by an absurd club type culture.  If you are part of old guard, or related to old guard and its clubs, schools, etc, you can do your own... thing."
"673","We could probably be more productive and sell a lot more if work spaces were better organized and planning was clear.  And favoritism was not such a big problem."
"674","Blind leading the blind. Management's goal is turn everyone into a sales person - thus, there is not much breadth with work but significant depth with MSCI data and products.  Leadership style of upper management is to instill fear with use of threats and intimidation. You always feel on edge."
"675","Limited exposure to clients which can limit exposure"
"676","Nominal Pay Scale, Fixed Bonus Structure"
"677","Lack good management and limited growth. The work of analyst and VP overlaps to huge extent VP."
