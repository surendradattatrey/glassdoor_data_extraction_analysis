"20",2,"- Great equity index business. Index products are highly respected in the investment management industry and MSCI generates impressive margins. Check out their investor relations site and you know what I mean. A very profitable business means that, in principle, you can earn good money. But beware: MSCI is shrewd at keeping profits up and employee cost down. Negotiate hard to get what you need up-front as you're... unlikely to see much upside in your job. 
- Management focused on cost control. You will probably experience this as a mixed blessing but it helps to preserve profitability. MSCI hasn't gone crazy  acquiring other firms and is unlikely to dump money into hopeless M&A projects. Firm is financially in good shape (again: check financial reports) and has managed its IPO and spin-off from Morgan Stanley well.
