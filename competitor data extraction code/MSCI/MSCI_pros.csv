Senior management promoted an egalitarian culture that is uncommon in the finance industry, and put real effort into making everyone feel valued.  Risk-taking was encouraged, and failure was generally seen as a learning experience that... wouldn't necessarily cost anyone their job or seriously damage their career.

"478","Je zou echt genieten van het werken met MSCI als je van grote hoeveelheden data geniet, dit is een erg breed spectrum die het verzamelen, controleren en analyseren omvat. Bovendien, de werkomgeving is er ontspannen vergeleken met andere investering analytici en financiële instellingen.
Hoewel er veel druk ligt op de werk nauwkeurigheid, is het behapbaar, vooral als je erg open staat en enthousiast bent over het... leren van nieuwe dingen en processen.

401 (k) matching is good, although its too ironic for words that they are promoting ESG/have an ESG division and do not offer a ESG OPTION for the 401(k).... Very disappointing and disingenuous. There are also no real internal ESG policies or programs. 

Opportunities to take on significant responsibility, which gives you great experience and keeps you growing professionally (although there is no, and I mean no, financial compensation tied to taking on more responsibility.

"670","- Great equity index business. Index products are highly respected in the investment management industry and MSCI generates impressive margins. Check out their investor relations site and you know what I mean. A very profitable business means that, in principle, you can earn good money. But beware: MSCI is shrewd at keeping profits up and employee cost down. Negotiate hard to get what you need up-front as you're... unlikely to see much upside in your job. 
- Management focused on cost control. You will probably experience this as a mixed blessing but it helps to preserve profitability. MSCI hasn't gone crazy  acquiring other firms and is unlikely to dump money into hopeless M&A projects. Firm is financially in good shape (again: check financial reports) and has managed its IPO and spin-off from Morgan Stanley well.
- Considering its size, MSCI has a very international footprint. You are likely to collaborate with colleagues around the world. You would typically have to join a much larger organisation to get a similar global experience."

If you're in an outward-facing role, you'll also get excellent access to money manager clients (i.e., future employers). On the day to day level, you get to work with smart people and do interesting work, often in a collegial atmosphere."
"675","RiskMetrics is a place where everyone's opinion is valued, and everyone has the opportunity to make a contribution.  There is also the opportunity to learn new things and work on exciting and interesting technologies.  And, everyone has the ability to define their own career path, such as it is."
"676","Formerly Barra, this was once a place that had a grad school atmosphere and was a market leader of institutional analytics. The brainpower and product knowledge and support was unrivaled then, but a lack of leadership in management and inability to harness and support talent lead to a steady bleed of talented individuals to its competitors.

However some talent remains, especially on the research side, where a few... from old Barra remain, so there is still some niche opportunity for learning.

Its sunny downtown Berkeley location is ideal for commuters and the atmosphere remains somewhat relaxed. Consideration for work/life balance can vary greatly with your department and supervisor."
