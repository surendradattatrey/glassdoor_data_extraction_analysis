"10","- Great equity index business. Index products are highly respected in the investment management industry and MSCI generates impressive margins. Check out their investor relations site and you know what I mean. A very profitable business means that, in principle, you can earn good money. But beware: MSCI is shrewd at keeping profits up and employee cost down. Negotiate hard to get what you need up-front as you're... unlikely to see much upside in your job. 
- Management focused on cost control. You will probably experience this as a mixed blessing but it helps to preserve profitability. MSCI hasn't gone crazy  acquiring other firms and is unlikely to dump money into hopeless M&A projects. Firm is financially in good shape (again: check financial reports) and has managed its IPO and spin-off from Morgan Stanley well.

Hoewel er veel druk ligt op de werk nauwkeurigheid, is het behapbaar, vooral als je erg open staat en enthousiast bent over het... leren van nieuwe dingen en processen.

Senior management promoted an egalitarian culture that is uncommon in the finance industry, and put real effort into making everyone feel valued.  Risk-taking was encouraged, and failure was generally seen as a learning experience that... wouldn't necessarily cost anyone their job or seriously damage their career.  The best part for me was being surrounded by smart colleagues who were strongly committed, challenged me and helped me raise my game, no matter what the context.
