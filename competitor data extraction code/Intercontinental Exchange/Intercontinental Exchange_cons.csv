"4","*This review specifically applies to ""ICE Trust LLC"" which is the OTC Credit Default Swap clearing house for the Interncontinental Exchange.

This employer exhibited some red flags when several senior people left in 2010 after only working there a few months (< 6 months on average). Notable departures include a Senior Software Engineer, Systems Analyst, QA Lead and one (of two!) DBA.  As this is only about a 40... man team, the overall level of attrition was disturbing.

ICE TRUST sold itself as a growing company with a need for ""senior"" people which turned out to be rather false as new ideas were rejected or at best shelved ""until later"" as impossible deadlines kept the focus on things that needed to be done yesterday.  ZERO work-life balance.  Technologists were routinely working on the weekends to release software to Production. The good engineers were (privately) praised for working round-the-clock Citadel-style.  In fact the pace of change proved too rapid and the group ended up making some costly mistakes and was put on ""timeout"" by Atlanta management.  Some serious inter-group dysfunctions, in particular their Quants would rather not work with anyone outside of their Ivory Tower which was quite contradictory to my experience with Quants at other financial institutions. Overall their SDLC and other methodologies were weak and fragile as compared to my previous financial employers. Code was branched ad nauseum, very scary situation.  They were forced to bifurcate their system in order to gain first mover advantage in 2009 and a looming high-risk code merge awaits them in 2011 (more off-peak work hours for sure).  QA team seems completely marginalized as are their other analysts, I would be surprised if half of them didn't quit in 2011 post-bonuses.  The performance of a software team can be partially ascertained by the relative contribution of their non-developer auxiliary teams. As such this place gets a D minus though it's NOT the fault of those individuals, they are smart and work hard. Rather, something completely fundamental is broken and the tail is pretty much wagging the dog here.

Management quality varied greatly.  Overall managers tended to focus on ""managing up"" rather than growing and coaching their own team.  It was hilarious watching people scramble to enter their *2010* career goals in the month of DECEMBER (at the END of the year)!!   ICE offers ZERO tuition reimbursement support, quite unlike their cross-town competitor (CME Group) and other major financial institutions in Chicago.  At ICE TRUST it seems ""Career Development"" = ""What have you done for me lately?"" If you're considering going to ICE Trust,   CONSIDER ANOTHER COMPANY!!   You've been warned."
"5","small company, not much opportunity to grow"
"6","startup culture not much structure reporting relationships are not well defines"
"7","Difficult senior manager in marketing/sales area."
"8","Work from home allowed only on weekends and after-hours to support issues. No Work/life balance. Promotions are for a select few not based on merit. Training/Tuition reimbursement is not offered. 
 A few years ago CEO Jeff Sprecher made a Freudian Slip - during a conference call with the entire company he said he wished he could have all ICE employess toiling away as his slaves.
 After NYSE acquisition there will... be massive layoffs (2000+) in New York."
"9","Very little tolerance for non-traditional schedules, absolutely no respect for family work/life balance.  Very little opportunity to advance career or even move around to more interesting assignments."
"10","Work Load. No job security."

debates can turn angry at times"
"14","This review is for IntercontinentalExchange Chicago, formally ICE Clear Credit or ICE Trust (Credit Default Swap Clearing house for ICE).

There is zero work life balance; long days and regular weekend work are expected. There is an incredible amount of attrition caused both by employee choice and personal management issues on very small development teams. Several inexperienced managers hired by upper management... friends especially in the technology area, this should eventually improve over time as the attrition and overall employee dissatisfaction continue. The review process is one directional with little opportunity to provide upward feedback. The code base is currently broken in two with a large monolithic J2EE application, PERL scripts, minimal unit tests and a second progressive version authored as dozens of interdependent projects. Innovation is defined as revisioning obsolete systems into somewhat modern architecture.

Please read the other review of ICE Chicago 2010 as it is still completely accurate as of 2012. Expect the same attrition throughout the year."
"15","- Lot less documentation and a new employee has to struggle his way in and is expected to figure  
  things out
- Very few vacation days"
"16","too few vacations and holidays"
"17","Mediocre benefits for employees. Long work hours."
"18","It's difficult for me to find anything negative to say so I will mention that working from home is generally not allowed. My commute took on average 1-1.5 hours each way every day. No fun."
"19","Career growth hindered unless you are in favor of the right people irrespective of your contribution or knowledge"
"20","growth of employees is stunted especially if ICE acquires company1 and if the company1 employees are not trusted and allowed to grow,it is mutual distrust till the employee is let go due to marginalization."
"21","If ICE purchases the company you currently work for, start to look for new work asap. They may not keep you around, or ask you to transfer to another location. Many people there were employees due to acquisitions."
"22","Need to dedicate long hours and overtime is expected."
"23","ICE is still facing growing pains as it enters uncharted territories of new markets and services.  Yet, it's nimble enough to shift resources and priorities based on rapidly changing regulatory and client landscape. Most of its products are heavily regulated and work can be burdened by frequent audits and compliance requirements - as a publicly traded company ICE answers to shareholders and as a systemically... important institution it has heavy reporting requirements to SEC, CFTC,'the Fed', FSA and EC to name a few."
"24","Very hierarchal culture, secretive,  long working hours.  
Very old technologies being reused from the old days, nothing new. 
Pervasive Bureaucracy , lots of layers to go through. 
Promotions are not based on merit. 
No tuition reimbursement."
"25","none. I just love working in this company. Just lots of hours to work"
"26","Not much training going on as yet but will take time to determine this"
"27","The old NYSE culture makes it hard to get anything done or see real ownership of projects."
"28","All of the acquisitions present challenges"
"29","""Flat culture"" they say,  could be ideal in a smaller org, but here it has only led to 0 leadership on the floor.  

Seasoned employees come in late,  take 2 hr lunches,  key projects fall weeks & months behind with no consequences. 

No training,  no on boarding, you have to figure it out yourself.

No work life balance,  you are expected to work 50+  hrs a week, expect to have meetings scheduled on your... lunch break."
"30","The don't pay staff much. They are more about buy companies and than investing in the ones they have."
"31","Management will ask you to do questionable things. Internal transfers are very rare because there is a major emphasis on headcount, as opposed to actual deliverables. Career growth is only available in a few chosen areas. Leadership is nonexistent in a few of the divisions, which leads to low morale and even lower output."
"32","- Should be able to adopt to ICE culture."
"33","nothing new to learn in our team"
"34","Very poor company , make lots of promises on bonus but never fulfill them , expectation is the work 9 hrs and go home and work some more . If you do some side work for your own knowledge it is discouraged completely . They give u rsu ( restricted stock unit ) every year as part of bonus and only 33 % gets vested , if you dont obey what they say they will let you go and keep the stock . They lawyers in this company... are very smart and cover all the grounds so no one can sue them .SO BE VERY CAREFULL"
"35","Little if no work from home policy, the immature CEO seems to treat women the same way they were decades ago. 

We do wonder, what's next? Should they bake a cake? Iron a shirt?

Where is your approach towards a modern woman that wants to balance work and her family?"
"36","The pros are before the CDS Clearing House came under new technology management for both US and EU.  Tech management now sows discord amongst teams and makes up lies about people.  Micro-manages everything while knowing nothing.  A classic functional narcissist.  Also picks favorites regardless of performance and punishes any ideas outside of his ""vision"".  Intra and inter-team cooperation was at an all time low... when I left."
"37","Terrible management; low base pay with next to no yearly increase; equity offered to try and prevent turnover (vests over 3 years); people take on more than they can handle, resulting in botched outcomes; very cheap and always trying to save a buck when they can, regardless of the impact"
"38","Hard to get a raise even with promotion"
"39","The work can get boring. Not very challenging. They don't pay as well as a fund, bank or FCM would. Upper management doesn't pay much attention to Regulation staff because it's not a profit center."
"40","Management unapproachable, rude and ignorant. No communication or support.
 Negative culture -  acknowledged but never addressed. 
 Headcount turnover through the roof, resulting in the constant (monthly) replacement of talented staff 
 This then impacts team morale which is already low. Poor work/life balance due to feelings of stress. 
 No room to grow, no perks (like a friendly office, flexibilty, team... bonding), no office atmosphere at all."
"41","Very high turnover which is not questioned
Leaders lack leadership skills
Management do not care for your well-being
The London office is full of bullies
Staff are so unhappy
Old management style
They have an awful culture and have no values unlike other organisations within financial services."
"42","Low base pay, no work from home, arrogance abounds, middle management act in a dictatorial fashion blocking everyone else from communicating up or down the chain, unwilling to spend money when needed, no real perks for employees"
"43","Yet they sometimes have no clue"
"44","No commitment to sales, not sure what goal of company is"
"45","The company's culture has been completely replaced by that of NYSE and that is disastrous. ICE may have bought NYSE, but it very much seem like it's the other way around. 
Since a NYSE person was promoted ahead of my manager we have been micromanaged and our jobs are made much harder by this. The senior ICE management has allowed the former NYSE personnel to be promoted ahead of their own people and this has caused... a great deal of resentment among the long term employees of ICE. 
IT policies have changed as well and the NYSE policy of locking down employee workstations to the point to where it makes getting anything done to be tedious and everyone's jobs to be far more difficult than they need to be has become the new norm.
All of this has brought me to the point where I'm so considering leaving the company that I am actively looking for a new job. Should one come along that matches the compensation I'm getting at ICE I will promptly give my 2 weeks notice as many other ICE employees have done in the last several months."
"46","limited room for growth, no internship program, does not provide part time employment, expectations and work load spread you too thin, stiff environment"
"47","Located in Central London where communicating can be tiresome."
"48","It was had to find many a negatives except for communications and maybe disseminating of data and ideas when interacting with other groups in a different time zones , however one is always able to resolve and miscommunications."
"49","ICE management thinks NYSE can do no right."
"50","No work from home
long hours.. minimum 9 to 10 daily and with occasional weekend work. Must come before 9 and cant leave before 6
Stale work, You will loose whatever skills you have by keep figuring out how things works in ICE.
No training of their domain or products and they change too fast
No requirements or documentation
Your boss will never listen to you. in ICE its all top to down approach where whatever... management tells is right
Most important No Process
No advancement. Title here are useless.. You could be a director/manager and still might not be managing even a single resource.
No work-life balance and they dont care about your personal family life."
"51","* There is tension between the NY and Atlanta offices with the center of gravity being Atlanta.  This can be frustrating to NY employees because preference is given to ideas an developers there. No major projects started out of New York recently.
* No work from home.  Your manager might allow it, and HR might turn a blind eye.  But officially, it is completely not allowed.
* Stingy benefits.  Less than customary... amount of vacation.  No personal days.  They take your holidays and make 4 of them floating.  Until very recently, rollover was not allowed at all.  Maternity leave, for those who might need it, is less than standard."
"52","no employee development, no flexibility, top down approach, no concerns for employee issues"
"53","When ICE acquired us, they completely destroyed our company culture.  We lost everything that made us unique and became cogs in the ICE machine.  Then they decided to fire (almost) everyone and close our entire office.  Work/life balance is non-existent.  Management constantly talks about transparency while providing absolutely none."
"54","Long hours, high pressure, night and weekend work required and planned into project schedules months in advance. No work life balance. Myopic management who only consider how to cut costs. Much blame to go around when things go wrong."
"55","When we were acquired by ICE everything about our company fell apart. We lost flexibility, work at home privileges, salaries were barely adjusted, bonuses were lower, and our company culture suffered. ICE promised ""transparency"" and instead dismantled our company and is closing our Phoenix office. We were a growing company and now we have been hollowed out and taken apart."
"56","slow at times, management sometimes confused, no potential for major growth within the company"
"57","Not sure I can determine all the cons in 20 words or more. Weak management, weak structure, either you're in the club or you're a dog."
"58","- zero communication from management
- do nothing to invest in training or career development
- the culture is work hard, long hours, little recognition
- flat titles and constant cost cutting makes it difficult to be promoted"
"59","-Way too much work load. 70-80 work week including Saturdays even for non-critical work.
-Management chews more than it can swallow, too many project with very short unrealistic deadlines with sub par delivery all for the sake of cost saving.
-Project timeline slippage is frequent
-Managers are persuasive but not logical or technical."
"60","Mind numbing boring repetitive work. No chance to move to a different job or advance in career. They hold you hostage with the three year vesting schedule of stock grants."
"61","The company is currently going through some growing pains as the NYSE integration continues. This is resulting in new processes, some of which are for the better, but not all."
"62","Struggling to retain legacy employees through ICE/NYSE acquisition. Little concern for inexperienced employees. Management decisions mostly political."
"63","As it has expanded much of what made the company an amazing project to be part of has been eroded. Process and admin make you feel like your swimming in mud. A number of middle managers have been brought in, adding additional layers. ICE don't promote talented staff. Staff aren't given time for projects or campaigns. Recent acquisition not buying in to the company mentality."
"64","Long hours (50+ hrs), their work from home policy only applies on the weekend. Limited growth, very operational mindset and repetitive. Annual pay is below average compared with the market."
"65","ICE is can too fast-paced.  They strive to be very lean and people are expected to do multiple jobs.  They have a minimum work week of 45 hours.  Though you will likely work more three quarters of the year."
"66","Long hours, poor for work life balance, not too much growth potential"
"67","good job"
"68","Lack of clear work priorities, hence most projects seem to go over schedule. When work falls between different teams there is often confusion and disagreement as to who is supposed to own the work.  Now that there are a bunch of layoffs, hoping for process improvement."
"69","There is no concern, care, or interest for the average employee. Once ICE came in and purchased the NYSE and its subsidiaries all benefits and wellness programs were stripped. They changed up the management and C-suite, which can be great, but not in this case. The president of Governance Services is a joke. He creeped everyone out and had dozens of HR complaints and investigations against him."
"70","Long hours, not much opportunity to progress"
"71","No flexible work hours
Weekend work almost very regularly
No growth prospects - promotions and career path is not transparent"
"72","Strategy wasn't always clear down to employee level. Somewhat red tapey and admin heavy. Compensation lowish for financial markets firm."
"73","could be long hours some times"
"74","There is no work from home policy, even though they spend millions on mobile technology. Some managers have egos and just plainly do not know how to manage. The environment is all work no play."
"75","Some organizational bloat introduces tedious tasks as part of the daily workflow."
"76","Work-life balance may not be for everyone."
"77","Constant pressure to cut costs past the point of what clearly makes sense for a business line.  Senior management frequently intransigent in their point of view, even when clearly wrong. Most business lines outside of core energy markets can be sacrificed to protect the core business. Poor work/life balance if you want career advancement."
"78","Only the inner circle is rewarded with huge compensation. The only thing important to management is to fool analysts into believing the hype so that the stock price will rise. No concern for corporate culture, employees, or anything other than paying the top ten as much as possible.  Three things are important: 1. Buy an existing company 2. Fire as many people as possible. 3. Increase fees as high as the market will... bear.  This is not a real corporation, it is a private equity fund. Inept management that gauges customers and fights over who gets to fly on the private planes. A house of cards, ready to fall. Expect the NYSE floor to be sold to Apple to create a store."
"79","horrible place to work, they do not value their employees"
"80","Once ICE acquired and also had another new company merger affect the company and business, the culture became cold and chaotic. Holidays were taken away, and employee programs were also discontinued. The new management completely changed the vision and purpose of the original company, and then they closed the office and laid most of the people off."
"81","Managers treat you like trash and threaten directly if you refuse to work off hours.  No career growth."
"82","Not much room for career growth"
"83","People don't talk much in the elevators."
"84","Limited career growth regardless of whether you really push hard or not. Earn your stripes through serious tenure and accept that its not fully meritocratic."
"85","Lot of info to take in quickly."
"86","Cliques are present in various departments, makes it difficult as a newbie to integrate."
"87","Compensation doesn't fit responsibilities. Some bad junior management. Inconsistent shifts and coverage."
"88","The management is very un-inspiring and non-motivational. They do not care much about professional/personal development - any such undertakings are not supported unless they contribute to the corporate bottom line. The team managers are old-schoolers who are ""managers"" because they have been around for years - they have zero managerial skills. Promotions are very hard to come by, and more often than not, they will... find a reason to not promote or not increase your salary. 

Pay - amongst the lowest of the financial services industry. Managers make it implicit that they do not expect people to stay around too long, resulting in high turnovers. Bonus and salary increments are not discussed with the employees - they use a very non-transparent evaluation/compensation system. Extremely poor benefits, things like the repayment of business expenditures are extremely long-drawn and bureaucratic to get back."
"89","You have to be friends with upper management to be treated well. Many tasks are proprietary and you will not be able to transfer alot of knowledge to another position. The work life balance is non existent. The stress that the job brings is not worth your sanity. The office politics are beyond ridiculous. The processes are very cumbersome  and systems are outdated."
"90","Probably the same as many other places.  Long work days and sometimes weekends."
"91","Put your focus on people, including both employees and clients, not processes. We understand change, but to completely devalue everything the Phoenix office had done for years was disappointing."
"92","Work quality is good but not properly implemented. Salary is good and that's the only reason people join and get stuck."
"93","Company keeps gobbling up the little guy and from there you lose your ability to be creative.  It's the ICE way or the highway.  Need to allow remote work to hedge long days and improve life / work balance.  Very strict company."
"94","Cafeteria is not great
No work from home policy"
"95","long working hours and very limited advancement opportunities
good place to start adventure with trading world - but you need to leave soon enough"
"96","None, love working here and compensation is great, changed my life really!"
"97","Lot of beaurocracy and things sometimes can move a bit slow. Not enough flexibility and independence for the employees."
"98","-Pay is better elsewhere for many roles
-Being heavily reliant on US IT support is tough for London department
-Some departments dont understand level of work required for other to accomodate requests, raises tensions occasionally"
"99","Few at the top have done well for themselves, no room down the hierarchy for growth.
non-existant Work Life Balance.
Pay is not competitive.
Has its own unique culture and allows only ""certain type"" to grow."
"100","- Salaries are not the best and are all about your annual performance
 - Take a special kind of effort, often for multiple years, to get promoted
 - Often hire people from outside the company rather than prompting within"
"101","Poor or non existing management. I was in a team that had no sense of support, and received no training whatsoever while I have been bullied systematically by a more junior (but longer with the company) member of the team..Managers were never around to notice."
"102","Fairly high pressure since we deal with large sums"
"103","To many to count but to name:
no work-life balance
senior management cares only about themselves and their pockets...
Top down management at worst ...
Really bad moral, promotes a really bad attitudes ...
And much worse ...."
"104","Pace can be very intense with long hours at times, top-down management style, not much opportunity to influence direction unless you are at the top, improvisation/innovation opportunities limited, very little turnover so limited opportunities for promotion"
"105","No cons. It is a good place to work. No work from home. Pressure will be more when release happens"
"106","sucked the life out of an exciting institution, the NYSE. this company does not care about ANY of its employees, only its bottom line."
"107","The company does not have a work from home policy. Depending on the group or manager, you may have to take vacation or sick hours to handle ordinary life events."
"108","Unstable work environment due to acquisitions."
"109","No cons or negative aspects whatsoever."
"110","Steep learning curve in many areas of the business, so it can take a while before you are able to hit your stride and start making large contributions"
"111","Work-life balance can be challenging."
"112","I work with idiots who think that they are incredible and impressive. They are neither. It seems like most of these people are washed up from working for trading houses or could not make it as an actual engineer."
"113","work life balance
respect
power concentrated
dont rock the boat"
"114","Onboarding and initial training is just non-existent.
Managers that have no idea what managing is all about they are only managers because they have been in the company for a long time.
No spirit of innovation nor rules or procedures you have two guys doing the same thing in different ways one very fast one very slow and no one sees that only one approach should be used.
Back-stabbing is rife, management knows... about that but does not care at all. Some people will just try to raise their profile by making other people and team look bad in these cases management also does not care.
Software is basic needs serious investment.
Career progression is not supported and opportunities are rare. 
Salary very low if compared with other companies in the City.
Good place to start and then move on, management is not good, no sense of direction and everything is based in the USA, higher and more important positions should be available in the UK. 

Better options out there."
"115","Very rare opportunities for promotion. Pay does not growth rapidly. Further eduction not supported either financially or with time-off."
"116","Do not care about employees"
"117","With elite quality work comes long work hours. Some days can be longer than expected due to the workload."
"118","They still operate as if they only have a small number of employees. They are narrow minded with ideas, they are successful but I at a cost to their staff. Too many chefs in one kitchen syndrome here, would not recommend as a place to work unless you like micro management and endless interference. They want to own your soul"
"119","Clearly in early days of a long term strategy, where short term focus is on primarily on cutting cost."
"120","Very few, if any at all. You will wear many hats and work hard but will be compensated well and great opportunity for advancement"
"121","Carry on"
"122","Communicate with employees and foster stability to get the best from people."
"123","As part of the restructuring strategy they keep firing people on a regular basis even if you have been there for a long time - management as not a clear idea of what they want to achieve - lots of people that are called managers simply have no qualifications nor training to do that work they are just called managers since they have been in the company for a long time. They could not survive in another organisation.... 

Resources are very stretched everyone is totally loaded with work and managers say they want to raise the bar which is not possible with the existing resources.

Serious problem regarding management, they have no idea what they are doing and just run around like crazy people. 

Salary is not good you can find much better options in London.

There is no career prospect in real terms you are stuck, you can work hard or not that is irrelevant it only depends if your manager likes you or not."
"124","Being a huge multi-layered corporation, there can be some bureaucracy."
"125","Not sure on where to start from :-(. This company or may be department(Salesforce.com CRM) has many issues which are difficult to explain.

- Incompetent Management
- No work-life balance.
- Micromanagement.
- No flexibility or work from home policy. But on the weekend's you might be asked to ""work from home"" without any prior notice because of poor planning and execution. 
- No credibility for hard work - If... you are good @ work you might be asked to work almost every weekend.
- No roadmap and Strategy. 
- No vision for platform scalability.
- Very fewer changes to enhance your skills and make credibility with business because the manager will provide a demo of your hard work and eat the credit."
"126","political political no advanced technology"
"127","Loss of startup atmosphere; things take too long, if you are not in NY management you are not a relevant decision maker."
"128","not so good management, lack of purpose sometimes."
"129","Management is very bad . HR policies favor very ruthless management tactics ."
"130","Nothing negative. I just like the firm"
"131","They micro manage and treat their employees like their clients, a transaction."
"132","No work from home policy."
"133","Limited ability to change things in the company"
"134","Shift pattern is rubbish, Management have been there so long they are out of touch with providing a comfortably environment for the staff, they often go to the pub at lunch and leave the data center manned to minimal resources. 

There is no way to progress within the data center as the dead wood have been there for 15 years plus and the environment for new employees is intimidating"
"135","Management detached from the day to day, and only care about acquiring companies and appeasing shareholders. Culture is ok, but they let people go every quarter to prop up the balance sheet. Could be a good company to work for if they weren't so short sighted."
"136","Structure is very vertical, promotions are political"
"137","The company doesn't seem to care about employees. Cutting costs seems to be the number one priority. Communication is poor. After acquisition: decrease of PTOs, increase of hours without raise"
"138","Decrease in benefits, decrease in PTO's, poor Insurance options, seeing a lot of layoff's after acqusition"
"139","Things can change quickly, which can be a positive"
"140","Teams tend to be in highly focused silos, which creates subject matter experts (in theory), but my experience with my own manager is that I am actively discouraged from helping other teams.  My manager justifies this by not wanting to overextend his staff, which already had plenty of work to do, but it still always feels disheartening.

Partly because of this, it’s also very hard for newcomers to find the right... people to talk to about a given issue with our technology platforms.  My first year was spent trying to figure this out on my own, but 80% of the time I still had to bother my boss.

The company strongly discourages work-from-home to the point of obnoxiousness.  The irony is that MANY people I worked with, right up through upper management, quietly worked from home anyway.

I’ve found that lateral moves within the company are very difficult, except during times of upheaval (reorganization) that seem to take place every 12-18 months.  And moving in those circumstances is rarely under my control."
"141","The department I was part of was acquired by ICE about one year before I left and had several changes in ownership prior to that.  The theme in the company was do more with less people."
"142","Career opportunities are limited if you want to stay in Israel."
"143","Trading system can be a sausage factory.  Difficult to suggest improvements, even with solutions to back it.  Upper management is good at throwing money at it, closing the door and turning up the pressure.   Has become very political, protective and a sweatshop for too many of the developers."
"144","Low salary compared to industry.
Horrid schedule if you are working in technology teams.
Long time to move up, need to be part of the managers club to move up quickly, your hard work will not get you there.
The work can be very stressful at times.
Not enough PTO offers to new employees, leads to stress."
"145","Working hour is tough for some analyst and IT position"
"146","Poor management, average compensation"
"147","Red tape is common. I suspect this is pretty normal however, given the size of the company and I understand why it's there."
"148","Shifts that work on all holidays, no consideration for their workers or their expenses, insulting salary."
"149","Top heavy management
Technology is not cutting edge, techs in Atlanta are embarrassing in front of clients
Alienate customers
Arrogant 
Archaic - don't permit working from home at all even for a single day - what century is this?

Clients hate ICE, it was truly embarrassing"
"150","Some flexibility in work hours would be great, but in return most people finish their day during normal business hours and do not need to give up evenings and weekends!"
"151","Let people know what it's really like to work here before aggressively luring them from other companies. Weed out the up-tight people if you want to make this place less depressing."

"176","ICE used to be a good place to work but it has been going downhill recently and no cool factor anymore. The company has grown out of bounds and executive management has no access to the true facts of the projects, and employees. 
There is no loyalty to employees. They will dump you for doing nothing wrong if it fits their agenda no matter who you are. Management makes tons of errors and will blame the lower rank.... It’s all about control and power over others here.
Non meritorious boot licking unprofessional culture. Office politics and distrust among team members makes you feel sick everyday go to work. Everyone's afraid of losing job.
Close minded and no good communication between departments and coworkers. The boss or his/her close aide will decide which meeting to attend and he will respond on your behalf and will demo your hard work to execute management and eat the credit. Management make promise after promise after promise but after your hard work all you get is blank stares and shrugged shoulders.
Zero work life balance. You are considered as a machine rather than a human being. Work from home is ONLY acceptable during after hours and weekend.
The company have created a bad internal culture which makes career advancement nearly impossible, no matter how talented you are. If you looking for a place long term this is not it. Unless you are a robot stay away. This company caused me major stress to work for which spilled into my life. I would often be abused close to tears.

#Close minded and backward thinking.  Your new ideas are not welcome here. you will be told to stay in your limits and never speak about what you think can improve the applications. Join ICE only if you want to work like a dumb person following orders.
# There is a toxic environment of distrust among team members. Everyone's afraid of losing job. Makes you feel sick... everyday you go to work.
#Different standards depending upon who you are. You have no rights  here if you are a junior employee. All rights are for Managers only. No work from home for junior employees only.  Mangers can work from home  as per their convenience.  Most managers take credit for the employees work. 
#They removed the stock options for employees which was the only attractive part of job here. I think the company is going down. They will soon remove cash bonus also.
# They expect you to do the work of 2 people everyday. 
#No loyalty to employees. They will fire you even after 11 years of service if it suits their agenda or you mess with the wrong person in your higher management.  I know 7 people let go who worked for ICE for more than 5 years. Mess means you didn't agree with your senior as he was clearly talking nonsense.
#Promotions are not merit based. They are strictly based on office politics. Favoritism is prevalent here.
#The HR will never listen to you or give you an opportunity to speak for yourself. They will blindly believe whatever your manger says about you. HR is their to help the managers keep the employees work like slaves of managers.

If by mistake you already joined or work here, try to leave after an year or so and move on to a good healthy environment company. ICE is not a place to build a long term career, It will convert you like its name: ICE COLD with no life! You will never prosper here."
"180","ICE used to be a very good place to work, but has been going downhill recently.  They no longer seem to value their employees and prefer to keep head count as small as possible.  As a result, innovation is stifled because everyone is doing two or three jobs to fill gaps left by people who leave the company.  Additionally, they do little to retain their top people, and will aggressively avoid compensating people who... take on larger roles.  

This year ICE cut all equity bonuses while slightly raising our cash bonuses and sold it as an ""exciting change"", as if we couldnt do the math (we're fantastic at financial modeling).  To make things worse, they did this retroactively in December.  Many employees wrote HR and told their managers that they were unhappy with the change, but nothing was done.

The company has shown these people the door and then brought in people who don’t understand the business... and are inexperienced and manage by fear.  This will cost the company in the long run-but maybe management doesn’t care because they’ve already made their money on the backs of their employees."

If you are a favorite of management (i.e you get them more face time with their boss or executives) you get the good... projects, the promotions, and they ""value"" your opinion. (Though they will turn on you in a heart beat)
*If you are not a favorite, promotions are none existence, you only get busy work, and you are looked upon as lazy. Promotions are NOT based on merit or skill set at all. In fact in some cases, if you are more proficient then a manager, they hide the fact and bad mouth you to their managers.
*If you are an ""invisible"" employee (i.e not a favorite or not an unfavorite), and you try to stand up for yourself, management will then take credit for your work and pile more on you so you are over worked. (If you are a favorite, you won't be overworked so no worries).
*Management isn't interest in making things more efficient because they like to make multiple people work on the same thing and then praise their favorite employee. They encourage a culture of back stabbing and gossiping.  
*Management has no problems making a work environment and allowing other staff to make make a work environment unprofessional and uncomfortable to the people they don't like to get you to leave.
*It's like working at Koch, Home Depot, or Georgia Pacific. There are some managers from those places and they brought the culture.
*Working from home is not an option at all. When the office ""closed"" due to snow, management expected you to remain even though there was a company wide email encouraging people to leave if ""they felt uncomfortable""...aka an email to protect the company.
*HR IS USELESS! HR is only there to protect the company and management. If you try to bring your concerns to HR, they will inform your manager and then do nothing about it. If you have an issue, just leave because going to HR will make it worse.
*Top managers like to play the ""gotcha"" game and will openly humiliate you in front of your co-workers (again if they don't like you).
*It's impossible to become one of the favorites unless you gossip, snitch on your co-workers, badmouth other departments and teams, and all around act like you are in junior high.
*Speaking of junior high, the culture is so unprofessional. The tax and accounting departments really are like being in middle school complete with bullies, teacher pets, and the outcasts."

No work from home although if you are tight with the bosses you don't have to show up Fridays in the summer with little to no questions asked. Massive layoffs without reason. If it's truly a sales job,... the numbers for everyone are posted every month I'd suggest letting the bottom 5% go every quarter instead of literally taking performers willy nilly because they may not fit in with your office politics and buddy scheme. The products are lacking as well. Look at ICE's most recent earnings specifically data services growth and it was flat YoY not allowing for inflation so technically down in a business they are supposedly investing heavily in."

They ordered us to adhere to their policies ASAP without any concern as to how rude they came off.  They barely answered emails and when they did, they were short and unhelpful, so trying to get anything done from anyone within ICE proper was nearly impossible. ... Luckily, they ended up  selling our specific group to another company and we couldn't have been more excited to leave.  Our new company has made us feel valuable and welcome since DAY ONE and they've never stopped. I just feel sorry for the other  teams that we had to leave behind at ICE who were begging us to take them with us."

When applying for new jobs internally, HR will not provide minimum/maximum salary range for  job positions.

"225","The culture is bad. Opinions are not valued.
The compensation is mediocre. No more stock grants.
The opportunities to learn and improve your skills are not good.
The ""bonus"" is arbitrary.
The culture is very top-down. Absolutely no accountability going in the other direction. Expressing opinions of any kind not strictly related to what you're working on, is discouraged. The company is very cheap about very dumb... things. The bean counters are firmly in control to the detriment of everything else.

ICE bought NYSE some years back, and on the NYSE side the perks remain better and the NYSE people seem to be treated with a little bit more respect and decency.
How they handle the New York Holiday party is a small but illustrative example of how this company devalues culture: Rather than have a venue where we can all get together and bring a guest, which is a real team-and-morale-building event (which is how it was done pre-nyse, some years) they choose instead to cheap out and ruin it. They host it on the NYSE trading floor, which, frankly, is a horrible venue. But it costs nothing! The party is actually two parties, on different days, because the space isn't big enough. There are NYSE and non-NYSE parties. For the NYSE people, they can bring a guest. The ICE people cannot bring a guest. To me it seems like ICE management would rather just not have a party and spend zero dollars, but especially in this time of economic expansion, to cancel the party would open the company up to ridicule. They don't want ICE to be seen as the company that canceled the Holiday party despite being rich and successful. But they should just cancel it because the way they're doing it probably does more harm than good. 

More significantly, last year they stopped giving out stock grants as compensation. they increased people's targeted bonus by some amount that doesn't come close to making up for it. Since the existing grants all had a 3 year vesting period, we're now in some diminishing returns territory, so you can count on a lot of people jumping ship soon.

This is a financial company, and so has this banking-style bonus culture that is different from non-financial companies I've worked for in the past. How it works is: you have your salary, and then there's a targeted bonus which is a percentage of that, that you will get some proportion of, depending on your performance. Its supposed to be dependent on performance but I've found it to have very little relation to how hard I've worked or how well I've done. There have been times (I had this explained to me by a trusted manager) where it was much more largely affected by some high roller in your group leaving the company at just the right time, thereby making it so the pool, per remaining employee, is larger."
"226","Could develop a clearer mission statement."
"227","Low pay for comparative skill level at other companies. Lots of stress that waterfalls from upper management all the way down to you. All the managers are yes-men, so dont expect anyone to stand up for you. Everything you do or say is a potential issue that you will need to defend your self against if management asks. If you want to last long here you basically have to do the opposite of your job, pretend you didnt... see a alarm, dont answer the phone, NEVER take a proactive approach to an issue. The less you can do (without getting noticed for under performance) the more likely you are to last."

when they do change your salary after a promotion, it's much lower than what they would pay to a new employee at the same job."
"232","The culture is terrible.  If you succeed you won't receive any thanks.  You were hired because they thought you were smart and success is expected of you.  If you fail, you'll be fired without hesitation because they don't care.  Don't expect fanfare, assistance, training, or much of anything.  You're just another cog in the wheel.  You'll be replaced when you break, fail, or whenever they feel like it.

The HR... department is just awful.  They exist solely to protect the interests of the company and not represent the interests the employees in any way.  There is no concept of employee assistance, development, succession, etc.   The lack of understanding even basic people management is apparent in the review process which is 100% geared against the employee, or the joke of a ""survey"" they send when people leave the company.   There is no follow up, no in person interview, because the outcome isn't viewed as relevant.  HR is just happy you're gone.  

In general the technology is falling behind, or at least it was while I was there.  Very slow to embrace new technology, no use of consultants or outside expertise, because they believe ICE is the greatest thing since sliced bread, (it isn't.)  Death by spreadsheet, decades old technology in some instances.  Things aren't upgraded because the teams are so spread thin they can't do anything other than just maintain or integrate from the most recent acquisition which averages about every 6 months.  

You'll be working nights and weekends routinely.  If you want a life, don't work here.  Again, you're a cog in a wheel, no one cares if you burn out.  You'll be replaced.   ICE paid better than most, we all made the deal with the devil and lived with the consequences.  I don't recall speaking with anyone that actually enjoyed working there."

"239","There is tremendous turmoil here.  The company has produced year over year record earnings and then, at Christmas, the executives issued an accross the board pay cut.  That is not a joke.  After cutting the pay the staff has remained unsettled with many top employees already having left, others have prepared resumes.  This coupled with increased technical debt has not prepared them well for the future. 

The... architectures here are very dated but the company is not in a growth phase.  So they continue to patch new business features on top of a cracked foundation rather than investing in new solutions.   

For me, I'd prefer to select a company that selects modern approaches to keep my skills up to date.  With many good opportunities in Atlanta right now, I would suggest a company that would value you."
"240","The company's hire management is not bothered about your work-life balance and don't care how much workload you are handling. Company policy is to overload you with tons of work and expect you to work late to get work done,
Working late is not an exception but a norm here. Folks tend to stay late to make an impression to there managers and are suitable rewarded. If you have kids and elderly's to take care of at home..., God save you from the wrath of your manager.

Company decided to remove equity part from packages retroactively. It's like you work for one month and at the end of the month you are told - ""Oh btw, we are only going to pay for 20 days instead of 30 days"". What's amazing is NO ONE raised there voice to oppose the decision. ICE surely knows how to suppress any aggression or opposition.

You are literally on the mercy of manager and most resort to buttering and worshipping. To their credit these tact's work very well."

"242","It makes you feel like you are part of a soulless machine beholden to Capitalism.  I observed the attitude towards customers to be a transactional game of how little can we cooperate with the customer.  While this company operates in a highly regulated industry, it also has a monopoly in many parts of it and charges accordingly for some of its less regulated offerings.  

There is also a lot of internal warfare... between a number of departments.  E.g. sales will sell the operational teams short to keep their commissions and the operational teams will withhold information to combat this.  Also the various product teams appear to work in silos and will do all they can to avoid helping other ones more than they have to."

"259","Where to begin:

Communication:  Almost none.  You are a cog in a wheel .... period!  

Culture:  Perfect place to sit behind a desk for 9 plus hours a day.  No team events.  You get to know almost nothing regarding the people you work with everyday. 

Attitude:  Not a lot of happy employees (including HR).  If you have an issue or want further clarification on a specific rule, HR will not happily help you!"
"260","Poor  Management; its not what you know its who you know.

Work is an illusion and not taken seriously.
No value for long term employees."
