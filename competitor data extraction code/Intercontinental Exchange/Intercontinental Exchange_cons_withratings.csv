"2","- ICE is devoid of growth opportunities and a ""clear path"" towards advancement.
- Equally, with lack of growth, there is a lack in compensation. 
- If you're looking for career complacency or if you're looking to ""plateau"" in your career, apply here.
- ""Company Politics"" prevent success from a leadership level
- Many Teams are ""new"" so there is a dearth of clearly defined processes, templates, and tools - which... leadership refuses to acknowledge"
"3","Provide Employees Clear Paths for Growth, Pay Your Employees, Invest in Employee Retention through improved processes and tools"

"8","Commute is very long to city perimeter"
"9","Long hours. Poor holiday allowance"
"10","Lack of training, lack of communication, change of benefits."
"11","Take notice of the ""Old school employees, they have so much knowledge""."
"12","* Minimum training
* Bad communication between teams"
"13","The company tends to overwork and underpay their employees. Compensation structure focuses on bonuses, equity, etc. so employees have to ""rough it"" throughout the year."
"14","Pay your employees what they're worth, and turnover wouldn't be a problem!"
"15","no longer equity bonus package"
"16","Work/Life balance can be a challenge, but is improving."
"17","- Below average compensation and not much benefits.
- Little to no investment in continuing education/growth of employees. Very rarely have I seen this happen here.
- Not much team spirit/camaraderie. Boring and predictable to be honest. If you like being in a bubble and sticking to set routine stuff with job security as long as you 'stay in your lane', then ICE/NYSE may be the perfect place for you.
- Nearly... non-existent career growth (Not saying it's impossible, but it's incredibly difficult to get that). Despite having seen signs of attempting to improve (Once in a blue moon), at the core they're still highly political, top-heavy, have tons of favoritism and backdoor dialogues, and just breaks promises/hopes."
"18","Like other company, you are strong does not mean you will be promoted."
"19","Zero warmth amongst team members, no personal interaction. Cold environment."
"20","- competitive

"21","1. Cramped open space office.
2. No career development program
3. Below market value pay package
4. No performance based annual reviews or pay increase (no correlation)
5. You are replaceable. Take it or leave it."
"22","Where to begin:

Communication:  Almost none.  You are a cog in a wheel .... period!  

Culture:  Perfect place to sit behind a desk for 9 plus hours a day.  No team events.  You get to know almost nothing regarding the people you work with everyday. 

Attitude:  Not a lot of happy employees (including HR).  If you have an issue or want further clarification on a specific rule, HR will not happily help you!"
"23","Value employees!  Never thought that would be something that needs to be stated."
"24","Poor  Management; its not what you know its who you know.
Managers are good at managing up and not down.
Management doesn't value feedback from subordinates. 
Work is an illusion and not taken seriously.
No value for long term employees."
"25","Implement management training program"
"26","Despite being a great technology based company it does come with very high expectations and the work life balance is not as good as other companies. It is expected working in such a high demand business but it does wear you down over time."
"27","not alot of input taken from the everyday employees for business decisions or processes, salary takes a while to increase if you get brought in as underpaid"
"28","- Very toxic work place (verbal for example)
- Work-life balance is nonexistent (strongly encourage to eat lunch at your desk is just the tip of the iceberg example)
- Absolutely no WFH policy (unless you want to WFH after you leave the office after working hours which is also encouraged)
- Pay is way below standards especially for software development
- With two weeks left in 2017 they cut everyone's stock... bonuses and refused to pay them out for that year (unless you were upper management and above) that was 20% of my compensation package which was COMBINED already below industry standard
- Career path was defined some finally in 2016 but its mainly for show - small bumps in pay and a better title with tons more work!
- Hiring here is a joke now - grab college grads who barely know what they are doing so they don't have to pay them much - as a senior developer I ended up training new people every 6 months to a year because of this strategy - almost no new people stayed very long
- Turnover is huge - on my team alone I saw MANY existing co-workers leave and many more who were hired/left in my 3 years - on a team that maxed out at around a dozen people. This seemed to be a trend in many departments near mine
- The stress, toxic environment, no work-life balance, and constant abuse over my years here did a lot of damage to my physical and mental health - I can not recommend to anyone that they work here!

There are many good places to work in Atlanta - this is NOT one of them!"
"29","None - you gaslight on purpose to save money - this is your whole strategy. I would not recommend anyone to work here passed the first 2 or 3 years of their career."
"30","You will spend more time on the process than doing the coding."
"31","No promotion opportunities. No trainning.  After two years working there probably you will need a change. Rutine job after one or two years."
"32","Old systems, benefits are not competitive"
"33","Can be very limiting, hard to go above and beyond"
"34","Leadership is hands off. Groups lack direction and clarity. High turnover."
"35","Provide direction and leadership for the high percentage of employees that maintain core businesses. Bottom up reviews to see how management is with leadership, group dynamics."
"36","I've been part of ICE multiple times from different companies  they have purchased and it just always gets worst. You lose your better benefits, PTO days, etc. They just expect you the fix the mess they made by buying all these companies. I'm not sure how the DOJ &  FTC let them get away with it as they are becoming a conglomerate."
"37","1. No overtime pay if you are required for night release. 
2. Lack of equal pay for equal work. Newer employees get paid more than experienced and loyal employees in the same position.  Even you can show your ability and your manager agree you are highly under pay in term of your position!  HR would refuse to give you the pay that your position deserve. Without promotion, you can only expect to get 3-5% pay raise a... year, making you hardly to reach the salary you deserve! The only thing you can do it WAIT patiently for 5-10 years! 
3. Better training programme required for new joiner"
"38","HR need to work closely with senior manager, knowing your employee ability, and provide  equal pay for equal work!"
"39","- Pay is low relative to the industry
- Not much new development. Mostly product enhancement and maintenance
- No career advancement
- No working remotely"
"40","In general, management is doing a good job.  Need to bring salary up to industry standard.  We are having hard time hiring candidate because of low offers."
"41","Lack of transparency in the company."
"42","Workload has the potential to be a lot, but is very manageable for the most part."
"43","There is tremendous turmoil here.  The company has produced year over year record earnings and then, at Christmas, the executives issued an accross the board pay cut.  That is not a joke.  After cutting the pay the staff has remained unsettled with many top employees already having left, others have prepared resumes.  This coupled with increased technical debt has not prepared them well for the future. 

The... architectures here are very dated but the company is not in a growth phase.  So they continue to patch new business features on top of a cracked foundation rather than investing in new solutions.   

For me, I'd prefer to select a company that selects modern approaches to keep my skills up to date.  With many good opportunities in Atlanta right now, I would suggest a company that would value you."
"44","For middle management find ways to value your employees.

For the executives... I'd reflect on your decisions and actions"
"45","The company's hire management is not bothered about your work-life balance and don't care how much workload you are handling. Company policy is to overload you with tons of work and expect you to work late to get work done,
Working late is not an exception but a norm here. Folks tend to stay late to make an impression to there managers and are suitable rewarded. If you have kids and elderly's to take care of at home..., God save you from the wrath of your manager.

Company decided to remove equity part from packages retroactively. It's like you work for one month and at the end of the month you are told - ""Oh btw, we are only going to pay for 20 days instead of 30 days"". What's amazing is NO ONE raised there voice to oppose the decision. ICE surely knows how to suppress any aggression or opposition.

You are literally on the mercy of manager and most resort to buttering and worshipping. To their credit these tact's work very well."
"46","Not a place to be if you aren't willing to work hard!"
"47","Keep the purity of mission at the forefront.  It's working."
"48","It makes you feel like you are part of a soulless machine beholden to Capitalism.  I observed the attitude towards customers to be a transactional game of how little can we cooperate with the customer.  While this company operates in a highly regulated industry, it also has a monopoly in many parts of it and charges accordingly for some of its less regulated offerings.  

There is also a lot of internal warfare... between a number of departments.  E.g. sales will sell the operational teams short to keep their commissions and the operational teams will withhold information to combat this.  Also the various product teams appear to work in silos and will do all they can to avoid helping other ones more than they have to."
"49","You are one company, act like it.  Treat your customers as more than a potential liability.  In my particular experience don't treat your employees like you own them.  Don't wallpaper over serious behavioral issues of those in power by accepting that's ""just how it is"" and avoid name calling."
"50","none  that i can think of so far"
"51","HR is hostile not friendly at all. Don't expect they will have you with anything. Management from ICE data services side in Asia is not transparent and sometimes unfair"
"52","Depends on manager you’re in.
Training"
"53","Flat organization, benefits are not great, vacation is limited, work on holidays, pay is not very competitive."
"54","Not too much opportunity for advancement"
"55","Too many to list but not being able to work remotely is the top."
"56","-Company Stock No Longer Given
-Many Tools Needed to Learn and Master Quickly
-Fast Pace is Not For Everyone"
"57","Bureaucracy, huge size, rigid to personal innovations"
"58","the salary is changed only once a year at the annual review so if you got a promotion on February you will work for the same salary a year. 
when they do change your salary after a promotion, it's much lower than what they would pay to a new employee at the same job."
"59","The culture is terrible.  If you succeed you won't receive any thanks.  You were hired because they thought you were smart and success is expected of you.  If you fail, you'll be fired without hesitation because they don't care.  Don't expect fanfare, assistance, training, or much of anything.  You're just another cog in the wheel.  You'll be replaced when you break, fail, or whenever they feel like it.

The HR... department is just awful.  They exist solely to protect the interests of the company and not represent the interests the employees in any way.  There is no concept of employee assistance, development, succession, etc.   The lack of understanding even basic people management is apparent in the review process which is 100% geared against the employee, or the joke of a ""survey"" they send when people leave the company.   There is no follow up, no in person interview, because the outcome isn't viewed as relevant.  HR is just happy you're gone.  

In general the technology is falling behind, or at least it was while I was there.  Very slow to embrace new technology, no use of consultants or outside expertise, because they believe ICE is the greatest thing since sliced bread, (it isn't.)  Death by spreadsheet, decades old technology in some instances.  Things aren't upgraded because the teams are so spread thin they can't do anything other than just maintain or integrate from the most recent acquisition which averages about every 6 months.  

You'll be working nights and weekends routinely.  If you want a life, don't work here.  Again, you're a cog in a wheel, no one cares if you burn out.  You'll be replaced.   ICE paid better than most, we all made the deal with the devil and lived with the consequences.  I don't recall speaking with anyone that actually enjoyed working there."
"60","Management doesn't care.  Why?  Because they make money hand over fist.  It's a fairly recession proof industry.  Trading never stops, so money is always there for the taking."
"61","too much secured environment which slows down fast to the market."
"62","Overworked staff, out of touch bullying managers who micro manage and have been working at the company  far too long"
"63","Start treating your employees humanely"
"64","Some projects base on old technologies and it takes a lot of time to move them to the newer.
No much creer opportunities"
"65","Requires excessive hours of work"
"66","Hours and shifts working nights holidays and weekends"
"67","Stay too long on the same project without shifting."
"68","Poor management and lidership and  not progress"
"69","Often arrogant attitude towards customers, no career opportunities for people not belonging to a small inner circle"
"70","None, since they are not interested in hearing it"
"71","With growth, sometimes too many cooks in the kitchen."
"72","Lack of equal pay for equal work. Newer employees get paid more than experienced and loyal employees. Therefore older employees miss out on pensions contributions due to lower salary payment. When applying for new jobs internally, HR will not provide minimum/maximum salary range for  job positions. Therefore you are applying for a job without knowing what is the possible salary and therefore  have no confidence you... will get fair pay for equal work.  Never enough staff to do the work required."
"73","Equal Pay for Equal work. Treat employees. Offer proper  Management training to managers and new staff training."
"74","the pay was reduced and stock grants removed for everyone other than this high ups.  they claim it to be so they can offer a higher base but that didn't happen, they just kept the profit"
"75","get rid of the good ole boy mentality that you advanced into management and actually higher people with management experience."
"76","Work load is unrealistic, constantly shifting priorities"
"77","Raise pay to be competitive with the area"
"78","- An employee cannot grow unless he becomes a manager. 
- The company is growing by buying other companies instead of recruiting new employees. That means - no career growth.
- Outdated release management methods using crappy tools developed in house instead of industry tools. CI/CD ?  Not in ICE.
- No innovation. Instead of innovating from within, the company is looking for buying it outside.
- The company's... DNA is of a slow dinosaur. Very slow with adopting new technologies."
"79","- Enable career growth to non-managers.
- Encourage innovation. It is much cheaper than buying it outside.
- Get rid of the old systems and replace them with better architected products."
"80","Those stupid screensavers that kick in after 2 minutes and keep you from holding a conversation.
Security-hobbled processes.
Terrible workflow software.
Minimal employee facilities, miniscule break room.
Required financial regulatory training even if you work nowhere near that stuff.
Since ICE acquisition, they've cut PTO for new employees, below what's common in Boston tech industry."
"81","No loyalty, no flexibility (i.e. work from home on occasion)"
"82","Get with the times and allow employees with families to work from home once in a while."
"83","Promotion based on who you know or kiss up to, micro managers, others taking credit for your work, people in leadership positions with poor decision making abilities."
"84","Make sure senior managers actually have the skills for their role, and aren't promoted merely on tenure with the company. Have better defined career paths for people and clear objectives on what it takes to be promoted. Dont ignore the back office functions in the quest to grow the company."
"85","They took a close-knit, respectful, helpful group of people and treated us like we were unwelcome and they just had to deal with these new employees.  They ordered us to adhere to their policies ASAP without any concern as to how rude they came off.  They barely answered emails and when they did, they were short and unhelpful, so trying to get anything done from anyone within ICE proper was nearly impossible. ... Luckily, they ended up  selling our specific group to another company and we couldn't have been more excited to leave.  Our new company has made us feel valuable and welcome since DAY ONE and they've never stopped. I just feel sorry for the other  teams that we had to leave behind at ICE who were begging us to take them with us."
"86","Teach upper management how to treat your employees with respect.  If you had any sense, you'd see how miserable everyone is.  And, the golden rule to a successful company is a happy work environment for their employees.  Learn it and live it."
"87","Long working hours (Strictly 9 hours). No work from home policy. After office support. Weekend work.  Stressful, toxic and politicized work environment. Self serving incompetent mangers treat team members like trash. No knowledge sharing among team members. No documentation.  Learn the system hard way. Compared to number hours you work (9 hours + After office support+ Weekend work) the bonus (~15-20%) is a peanut.... No career progression at all. High turnover rate."
"88","Reduce working hours to 8. Get feedback from team members about managers.  Treat employees with respect."
"89","The corporate culture does not look a big financial company that it should be."
"90","Managers and all leaders in Tel Aviv has human relations are very poor. Not recommended work in the ICE."
"91","Need to change all managers from  and Vip R&D"
"92","- Your life becomes your Job
- Pay does not match market
- NYSE plays by its own rules and has limited oversight sometimes."
"93","Reduce, turnover and punish markets that have excess turnover. Allow people to build and plan out careers that are not linked to remote management."
"94","low base pay when compared to other companies"
"95","has night shift; salary is blow average"
"96","Financial subject matter may be a turn off for some. I personally love it."
"97","Some co-workers aren't nice and they like to gossip a lot. A few formed a group won’t share the project information and bully the others by excluding from  communications  and makes fun during the project scrum.
Some days it will be extremely hectic and insane and they'll yell at you for seemingly no reason.
The name of the game is favoritism. If you are a favorite you get the good projects, the promotions, and... they ""value"" your opinion. If you are not a favorite, you only get redundant work; In fact in some cases,  if you are more proficient then they target and isolate you! and they hide the fact and bad mouth you behind your back and make belittling comments in the team meeting. 
The list is endless. The worst company, by far, that i'v ever had to work for. They don't value as an employee.  and approaching HR is like committing suicide.....they know their bullies!
If you are of substance you will not be around to handle being around such low quality quality people.
Zero work/life balance. Working here is like selling your soul to the devil!"
"98","Manage without being a bully. You aren't a better person because you a director, and a poor one at that. Get some floor experience and treat your staff with respect. Stop participating in groupism and bullying; and encouraging and allowing it. stop being such a corrupt bad place to work"
"99","The expectations are high, and the work is never ending.  If you hold responsibility for any kind of deliverable, then you will likely feel the pressure to complete on time."
"100","not met any cons so far"
"101","There are plenty.  After ICE purchased Interactive Data Corp they took away four holidays that we had off to align us with NYSE. They then make you use your personal time to take off on those holidays because the Bond Market is closed. Regarding the 15% stock....they gave everybody stock options for 3 years to start and said that stock options would be apart of your compensation going forward. They took them away... and instituted the stock purchase plan which you need to purchase with your own money.  They send out phishing emails attempting to catch people clicking on fake links."
"102","Value your employees more. You are killing moral by constantly taking away from employees. The people at the top need to remember that he reason you are filthy rich is because of the little people below you"
"103","No run for growth. The company is forgetting what made them the company they are.  No work life balance. Discrimination from management in New York. Completely terrible company after purchasing NYSE."
"104","Don't take your loyal employees for granted and listen to employees about discrimination"
"105","*Pay is pretty much the same as other places so nothing special. You can also find other places with the same % of cash bonus though after the equity bonus cut, it won't be long before they cut cash bonuses as well.
*The name of the game is favoritism, especially in the tax and accounting department. If you are a favorite of management (i.e you get them more face time with their boss or executives) you get the good... projects, the promotions, and they ""value"" your opinion. (Though they will turn on you in a heart beat)
*If you are not a favorite, promotions are none existence, you only get busy work, and you are looked upon as lazy. Promotions are NOT based on merit or skill set at all. In fact in some cases, if you are more proficient then a manager, they hide the fact and bad mouth you to their managers.
*If you are an ""invisible"" employee (i.e not a favorite or not an unfavorite), and you try to stand up for yourself, management will then take credit for your work and pile more on you so you are over worked. (If you are a favorite, you won't be overworked so no worries).
*Management isn't interest in making things more efficient because they like to make multiple people work on the same thing and then praise their favorite employee. They encourage a culture of back stabbing and gossiping.  
*Management has no problems making a work environment and allowing other staff to make make a work environment unprofessional and uncomfortable to the people they don't like to get you to leave.
*It's like working at Koch, Home Depot, or Georgia Pacific. There are some managers from those places and they brought the culture.
*Working from home is not an option at all. When the office ""closed"" due to snow, management expected you to remain even though there was a company wide email encouraging people to leave if ""they felt uncomfortable""...aka an email to protect the company.
*HR IS USELESS! HR is only there to protect the company and management. If you try to bring your concerns to HR, they will inform your manager and then do nothing about it. If you have an issue, just leave because going to HR will make it worse.
*Top managers like to play the ""gotcha"" game and will openly humiliate you in front of your co-workers (again if they don't like you).
*It's impossible to become one of the favorites unless you gossip, snitch on your co-workers, badmouth other departments and teams, and all around act like you are in junior high.
*Speaking of junior high, the culture is so unprofessional. The tax and accounting departments really are like being in middle school complete with bullies, teacher pets, and the outcasts."
"106","Management isn't looking to change because those on top won't rock the boat to lose their privileged positions."
"107","Where to start? Beware of the offer. Basically,""some"" positions are bait and switch, with the intention of being solely hired as a punching bag.  This place has zero documentation with even fewer knowlegeable resources. Yes, the salary is high but it comes with a heavy price tag. If you're looking for daily humiliation and a healthy dose of passive aggressiveness, this is the place for you!"
"108","You need to invest more in employee engagement, and review company culture."
"109","Not too much opportunity for growth."

"113","Know your team players better"
"114","Managers showing up at your desk asking ""is this going to close"" without asking any help. Having to be responsible to sell a plethora of services without the firm even getting you set up for logins to said services. No work from home although if you are tight with the bosses you don't have to show up Fridays in the summer with little to no questions asked. Massive layoffs without reason. If it's truly a sales job,... the numbers for everyone are posted every month I'd suggest letting the bottom 5% go every quarter instead of literally taking performers willy nilly because they may not fit in with your office politics and buddy scheme. The products are lacking as well. Look at ICE's most recent earnings specifically data services growth and it was flat YoY not allowing for inflation so technically down in a business they are supposedly investing heavily in."
"115","Get and keep reliable talent and if you're going to commit lay offs, do it within reason of those are on the bottom of the sales role who are massively behind quota, not those that are outperforming."

they all drink the same Kool-Aid and it is bad."
"128","When I first started the company had a great morale and everyone seemed to really enjoy working together and now it seems they want to push everyone out who’s been there over 7 years. I’ve seen people who sacrificed everything (health, family, marriage) for this company be shown the door recently and it’s sad. The company has shown these people the door and then brought in people who don’t understand the business... and are inexperienced and manage by fear.  This will cost the company in the long run-but maybe management doesn’t care because they’ve already made their money on the backs of their employees."
"129","The recent layoffs are going to cost you in the long run. And the good employees who remain will start leaving and all the knowledge and experience will leave with them. It’s sad that such a great company at one time has turned into a toxic environment. Stop hiring from outside the company and start looking to promote within-sensitivity and actual management training in your upper management would go a long way too.... Start putting the money back in the company to grow it-a little will go a long way."

"135","Keep pushing the envelope on ideas and business strategy.  Keep hard charging culture."
"136","If you are not part of the inner circle, you will  get worked to the bone and it will never be enough.   Little to no work life balance.    There is a culture of whether you are ""ICEified"" or not.    If you aren't drinking the koolaid, you will never be made part of the valued set."
"137","We get it...you took a small group of people and built a behemoth of a company that has done outstandingly well since inception.    But you aren't 10 people in a single room anymore.   There has to be a way you can move forward and not make those outside of the original team feel like outsiders to the benefit of all."
"138","ICE used to be a good place to work but it has been going downhill recently and no cool factor anymore. The company has grown out of bounds and executive management has no access to the true facts of the projects, and employees. 
There is no loyalty to employees. They will dump you for doing nothing wrong if it fits their agenda no matter who you are. Management makes tons of errors and will blame the lower rank.... It’s all about control and power over others here.
Non meritorious boot licking unprofessional culture. Office politics and distrust among team members makes you feel sick everyday go to work. Everyone's afraid of losing job.
Close minded and no good communication between departments and coworkers. The boss or his/her close aide will decide which meeting to attend and he will respond on your behalf and will demo your hard work to execute management and eat the credit. Management make promise after promise after promise but after your hard work all you get is blank stares and shrugged shoulders.
Zero work life balance. You are considered as a machine rather than a human being. Work from home is ONLY acceptable during after hours and weekend.
The company have created a bad internal culture which makes career advancement nearly impossible, no matter how talented you are. If you looking for a place long term this is not it. Unless you are a robot stay away. This company caused me major stress to work for which spilled into my life. I would often be abused close to tears. This is the worst company i have ever worked for. 
One last thing HR works to protect the company. Seek HR or senior management advice only if you decided to quit job."
"139","Structure your company better and work on building culture. Restructuring is not laying off those loyal employees and hiring some new scapegoats.
Take ownership for your own mistakes. Have some respect to your employees who helped you to build your fortune.
No matter how promising a company looks to the media, if the value proposition and forecast is unclear, the company does not have a winning strategy."

- People promoted on favoritism not merit. 3/4 of people they retained were inferior kiss ups.
- Poor work/life balance. People who knew more, had more work while others... conversed while the work was getting done."
"143","Your review process needs work.  You let good people go while retaining others that had no business being there.

HR needs to be more compassionate and not be cold & arrogant."
"144","Not a good employer from any perspective:
#Close minded and backward thinking.  Your new ideas are not welcome here. you will be told to stay in your limits and never speak about what you think can improve the applications. Join ICE only if you want to work like a dumb person following orders.
# There is a toxic environment of distrust among team members. Everyone's afraid of losing job. Makes you feel sick... everyday you go to work.
#Different standards depending upon who you are. You have no rights  here if you are a junior employee. All rights are for Managers only. No work from home for junior employees only.  Mangers can work from home  as per their convenience.  Most managers take credit for the employees work. 
#They removed the stock options for employees which was the only attractive part of job here. I think the company is going down. They will soon remove cash bonus also.
# They expect you to do the work of 2 people everyday. 
#No loyalty to employees. They will fire you even after 11 years of service if it suits their agenda or you mess with the wrong person in your higher management.  I know 7 people let go who worked for ICE for more than 5 years. Mess means you didn't agree with your senior as he was clearly talking nonsense.
#Promotions are not merit based. They are strictly based on office politics. Favoritism is prevalent here.
#The HR will never listen to you or give you an opportunity to speak for yourself. They will blindly believe whatever your manger says about you. HR is their to help the managers keep the employees work like slaves of managers.

If by mistake you already joined or work here, try to leave after an year or so and move on to a good healthy environment company. ICE is not a place to build a long term career, It will convert you like its name: ICE COLD with no life! You will never prosper here."
"145","Listen to  those employee too who are not managers. They are the one who truly work to support your company. Otherwise soon they will leave for better companies where they are treated equally."
"146","ICE used to be a very good place to work, but has been going downhill recently.  They no longer seem to value their employees and prefer to keep head count as small as possible.  As a result, innovation is stifled because everyone is doing two or three jobs to fill gaps left by people who leave the company.  Additionally, they do little to retain their top people, and will aggressively avoid compensating people who... take on larger roles.  

This year ICE cut all equity bonuses while slightly raising our cash bonuses and sold it as an ""exciting change"", as if we couldnt do the math (we're fantastic at financial modeling).  To make things worse, they did this retroactively in December.  Many employees wrote HR and told their managers that they were unhappy with the change, but nothing was done.   Lots of good people are heading for the exits."

"159","There is no loyalty is this place. They will dump you for doing nothing wrong if it fits their agenda. If you looking for a place long term this is not it. The salary is weak but they promise big bonuses. You'll be lucky if you're there long enough for a bonus. I have worked at other places and this one is a complete revolving door. Management makes tons of errors and will blame the lower rank. Be careful if you do... take an offer from this place and be sure to read all the fine print. There is also no upside potential meaning promotions. This is not to bash the place but to be honest."
"160","Take ownership for your own mistakes. You would have better relations with employees if they weren't in fear for their jobs everyday."

*Benefits aren't so great. Got expensive after ICE took over Interactive Data
*Pay for what you do is not equal
*You may have to work on major holidays depending on your position in the company."
"163","Upper and Executive Management, invest more into employees and their benefits. The company has to find an automated or alternative way to make sure employees don't work on holidays."
"164","The company doesn't seem to care about employees. Cutting costs seems to be the number one priority. Communication is poor. After acquisition: decrease of PTOs, increase of hours without raise"

"167","Please care for employees"
"168","Things can change quickly, which can be a positive"
"169","Teams tend to be in highly focused silos, which creates subject matter experts (in theory), but my experience with my own manager is that I am actively discouraged from helping other teams.  My manager justifies this by not wanting to overextend his staff, which already had plenty of work to do, but it still always feels disheartening.

Partly because of this, it’s also very hard for newcomers to find the right... people to talk to about a given issue with our technology platforms.  My first year was spent trying to figure this out on my own, but 80% of the time I still had to bother my boss.

The company strongly discourages work-from-home to the point of obnoxiousness.  The irony is that MANY people I worked with, right up through upper management, quietly worked from home anyway.

I’ve found that lateral moves within the company are very difficult, except during times of upheaval (reorganization) that seem to take place every 12-18 months.  And moving in those circumstances is rarely under my control."
"170","If you’re going to stick with a vision of the modern work environment that includes sterile, mind-numbing open floor plans, you had better learn to embrace work-from-home in a more honest way.  You’re scaring off some good workers with your obstinacy.

Get teams talking to each other more openly, and even help each other out.  We’re supposed to be one company."

"174","Trading system can be a sausage factory.  Difficult to suggest improvements, even with solutions to back it.  Upper management is good at throwing money at it, closing the door and turning up the pressure.   Has become very political, protective and a sweatshop for too many of the developers."
"175","ICE is a great place for a lot of the employees, it's just not consistent throughout other departments.  Send your tech managers  to regular training, and help them with people and business skills.  You want to promote leaders.  Ask your developers and staff if they work for a leader or a manager."
"176","Low salary compared to industry.
Horrid schedule if you are working in technology teams.
Long time to move up, need to be part of the managers club to move up quickly, your hard work will not get you there.

There is no way to progress within the data center as the dead wood have been there for 15 years plus and the environment for new employees is intimidating"
"190","Get some new blood that knows how to run a Data center Team !!"
"191","Management detached from the day to day, and only care about acquiring companies and appeasing shareholders. Culture is ok, but they let people go every quarter to prop up the balance sheet. Could be a good company to work for if they weren't so short sighted."
"192","This is for Senior Management. You're not royalty, so get off your high horse and show you actually care about the people who you work with as much as your care about your shareholders."

- Micromanagement.
- No flexibility or work from home policy. But on the weekend's you might be asked to ""work from home"" without any prior notice because of poor planning and execution. 
- No credibility for hard work - If... you are good @ work you might be asked to work almost every weekend.
- No roadmap and Strategy. 
- No vision for platform scalability.
- Very fewer changes to enhance your skills and make credibility with business because the manager will provide a demo of your hard work and eat the credit."
"199","- Adopt new tools and technology.
- Be open to new idea's and give people change to fail. 
- No option for 360' feedback. Please enable all employee to provide feedback about management.
- Stop the micro management and learn some people management skill. You need to treat people with respect else they won't respect the company and lose motivation to work.
- I think you need to change the few KPI's for lower... level management. Managers should be measured based on the value being added to the teams and the business.

"211","They still operate as if they only have a small number of employees. They are narrow minded with ideas, they are successful but I at a cost to their staff. Too many chefs in one kitchen syndrome here, would not recommend as a place to work unless you like micro management and endless interference. They want to own your soul"
"212","Listen to your staff and not just the ones with the fancy titles, there are so many things that could be done better and even save money rather than adopting the ""that's the way we've always done it"" mentality"

"223","As part of the restructuring strategy they keep firing people on a regular basis even if you have been there for a long time - management as not a clear idea of what they want to achieve - lots of people that are called managers simply have no qualifications nor training to do that work they are just called managers since they have been in the company for a long time. They could not survive in another organisation.... 

Resources are very stretched everyone is totally loaded with work and managers say they want to raise the bar which is not possible with the existing resources.

Serious problem regarding management, they have no idea what they are doing and just run around like crazy people.

No spirit of innovation nor rules or procedures you have two guys doing the same thing in different ways one very fast one very slow and no one sees that only one approach should be used.
Back-stabbing is rife, management knows... about that but does not care at all. Some people will just try to raise their profile by making other people and team look bad in these cases management also does not care.
Software is basic needs serious investment.
Career progression is not supported and opportunities are rare. 
Salary very low if compared with other companies in the City.

"269","Since the company is run very lean, which I believe is a good thing, promotions are very slow. Employees become engraved in their job function and are not encourage to move out of the their roles.  My advice would be to establish more cross training outside of each employees respective groups."
"270","The management is very un-inspiring and non-motivational. They do not care much about professional/personal development - any such undertakings are not supported unless they contribute to the corporate bottom line. The team managers are old-schoolers who are ""managers"" because they have been around for years - they have zero managerial skills. Promotions are very hard to come by, and more often than not, they will... find a reason to not promote or not increase your salary. 

Pay - amongst the lowest of the financial services industry. Managers make it implicit that they do not expect people to stay around too long, resulting in high turnovers. Bonus and salary increments are not discussed with the employees - they use a very non-transparent evaluation/compensation system. Extremely poor benefits, things like the repayment of business expenditures are extremely long-drawn and bureaucratic to get back."
"271","You need to work harder to align the interests of your employees with that of the firm, and support their development, especially the younger employees."
"272","You have to be friends with upper management to be treated well. Many tasks are proprietary and you will not be able to transfer alot of knowledge to another position. The work life balance is non existent. The stress that the job brings is not worth your sanity. The office politics are beyond ridiculous. The processes are very cumbersome  and systems are outdated."
"273","Treat employees like people and not assets. Become more transparent and fair to all employees. Have more group meetings where employee satisfaction is discussed. Implement an official training program for new employees. Practice consistency when implementing and carrying out processes. Treat everyone with respect at all times.

"274","Probably the same as many other places.  Long work days and sometimes weekends."
"275","ICE took away the benefits/culture that had previously been there, and upper management did not care about or value Phoenix employees. When they came after announcing the closure of our office, they complained about how much they hated coming. They came off to us as snobs and hardly looked any of us in the eye. Pathetic."
"276","Put your focus on people, including both employees and clients, not processes. We understand change, but to completely devalue everything the Phoenix office had done for years was disappointing."

"355","The company's culture has been completely replaced by that of NYSE and that is disastrous. ICE may have bought NYSE, but it very much seem like it's the other way around. 
Since a NYSE person was promoted ahead of my manager we have been micromanaged and our jobs are made much harder by this. The senior ICE management has allowed the former NYSE personnel to be promoted ahead of their own people and this has caused... a great deal of resentment among the long term employees of ICE. 
IT policies have changed as well and the NYSE policy of locking down employee workstations to the point to where it makes getting anything done to be tedious and everyone's jobs to be far more difficult than they need to be has become the new norm.
All of this has brought me to the point where I'm so considering leaving the company that I am actively looking for a new job. Should one come along that matches the compensation I'm getting at ICE I will promptly give my 2 weeks notice as many other ICE employees have done in the last several months."
"356","Terminate the remaining NYSE management, replace their policies/practices with those of ICE (which have been proven to work far, far better), and take the assets and name of NYSE without the baggage its people and culture brings along with them. There's a reason why ICE has grown and NYSE remained stagnant for decades upon decades to the point where it was bought out by a much younger company.

Micro-manages everything while knowing nothing.  A classic functional narcissist.  Also picks favorites regardless of performance and punishes any ideas outside of his ""vision"".  Intra and inter-team cooperation was at an all time low... when I left."
"374","It's the people who work that drove ICE from a small startup to what it is today.  Don't let career bureaucrats ruin the solid platform that is successfully running ICE CDS clearing.  This tech management leader is a typical example of a career bureaucrat who cares only about climbing the corp ladder while destroying the teams that have so far worked so well together in his political manipulations."
"375","Terrible management; low base pay with next to no yearly increase; equity offered to try and prevent turnover (vests over 3 years); people take on more than they can handle, resulting in botched outcomes; very cheap and always trying to save a buck when they can, regardless of the impact"
"376","You're not a startup anymore, its time to accept you are a global enterprise and adapt accordingly; take the time to understand the value your employees bring to your team and the organization as a whole; understand the ""you get what you pay for"" mentality, and don't be afraid to crack open the wallet once in a while"
"377","Hard to get a raise even with promotion"
"378","The work can get boring. Not very challenging. They don't pay as well as a fund, bank or FCM would. Upper management doesn't pay much attention to Regulation staff because it's not a profit center."
"379","You will not be able to retain talented and bright people in the department without paying them properly. Doing a lot of great things though."
"380","Management unapproachable, rude and ignorant. No communication or support.
 Negative culture -  acknowledged but never addressed. 
 Headcount turnover through the roof, resulting in the constant (monthly) replacement of talented staff 
 This then impacts team morale which is already low. Poor work/life balance due to feelings of stress. 
 No room to grow, no perks (like a friendly office, flexibilty, team... bonding), no office atmosphere at all."

"395","Your culture has been subsumed by the NYSE. Badmouthing employees who have left or transferred internally is unprofessional, and leads the team(s) to believe that you're more concerned about headcount than actual talent.

"427","This review is for IntercontinentalExchange Chicago, formally ICE Clear Credit or ICE Trust (Credit Default Swap Clearing house for ICE).

There is zero work life balance; long days and regular weekend work are expected. There is an incredible amount of attrition caused both by employee choice and personal management issues on very small development teams. Several inexperienced managers hired by upper management... friends especially in the technology area, this should eventually improve over time as the attrition and overall employee dissatisfaction continue. The review process is one directional with little opportunity to provide upward feedback. The code base is currently broken in two with a large monolithic J2EE application, PERL scripts, minimal unit tests and a second progressive version authored as dozens of interdependent projects. Innovation is defined as revisioning obsolete systems into somewhat modern architecture.

Please read the other review of ICE Chicago 2010 as it is still completely accurate as of 2012. Expect the same attrition throughout the year."

"436","*This review specifically applies to ""ICE Trust LLC"" which is the OTC Credit Default Swap clearing house for the Interncontinental Exchange.

This employer exhibited some red flags when several senior people left in 2010 after only working there a few months (< 6 months on average). Notable departures include a Senior Software Engineer, Systems Analyst, QA Lead and one (of two!) DBA.  As this is only about a 40... man team, the overall level of attrition was disturbing.

ICE TRUST sold itself as a growing company with a need for ""senior"" people which turned out to be rather false as new ideas were rejected or at best shelved ""until later"" as impossible deadlines kept the focus on things that needed to be done yesterday.  ZERO work-life balance.  Technologists were routinely working on the weekends to release software to Production. The good engineers were (privately) praised for working round-the-clock Citadel-style.  In fact the pace of change proved too rapid and the group ended up making some costly mistakes and was put on ""timeout"" by Atlanta management.  Some serious inter-group dysfunctions, in particular their Quants would rather not work with anyone outside of their Ivory Tower which was quite contradictory to my experience with Quants at other financial institutions. Overall their SDLC and other methodologies were weak and fragile as compared to my previous financial employers. Code was branched ad nauseum, very scary situation.  They were forced to bifurcate their system in order to gain first mover advantage in 2009 and a looming high-risk code merge awaits them in 2011 (more off-peak work hours for sure).  QA team seems completely marginalized as are their other analysts, I would be surprised if half of them didn't quit in 2011 post-bonuses.  The performance of a software team can be partially ascertained by the relative contribution of their non-developer auxiliary teams. As such this place gets a D minus though it's NOT the fault of those individuals, they are smart and work hard. Rather, something completely fundamental is broken and the tail is pretty much wagging the dog here.

Management quality varied greatly.  Overall managers tended to focus on ""managing up"" rather than growing and coaching their own team.  It was hilarious watching people scramble to enter their *2010* career goals in the month of DECEMBER (at the END of the year)!!   ICE offers ZERO tuition reimbursement support, quite unlike their cross-town competitor (CME Group) and other major financial institutions in Chicago.  At ICE TRUST it seems ""Career Development"" = ""What have you done for me lately?"" If you're considering going to ICE Trust,   CONSIDER ANOTHER COMPANY!!   You've been warned."
"437","You have managed to achieve a level of success but need to really reflect on your core values and methodologies if you intend on elevating your organization to the next level.  Good luck in 2011 (esp. after bonuses are paid), surely things can only improve.   As one of your departing technologists said it best, ""this place needs more 'Indians' (i.e., low-level workers), not Chiefs."""
