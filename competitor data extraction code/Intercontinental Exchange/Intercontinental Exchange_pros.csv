I never experienced any knowledge... sharing problems like some reviews are saying. I just dont think people here waste time, because there is no time to waste.

Recently some people were let go, but I wasnt surprised; they didnt qualify for the standard that ICE is looking for. All that were let go were given severance packages depending on their time with the company and contributions. Some people are expecting a catering/caring culture, well you wont find that here. Its the best of the best, doing their best, staying on top of the niches in the industry. Why do you think we are so profitable year after year?
