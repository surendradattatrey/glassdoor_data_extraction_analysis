"1","Fast growth = young leaders without much experience and lack of formal mentoring and leadership development programs leave many new managers fending for themselves."
"2","Good work situating the company poised to take advantage of market opportunities."
"3","Limited knowledge gaining opportunities, some departments are stuck in old technologies and do not want to change due to their leaders lack of interest in learning (but in gaining). People relations are neutral. Overall many manual operations for things can could have been automated long time ago."
"4","To stop the management ""one size fits all"" and focus on building more dialog with employees in particular having in mind the growing diversity within the company."
"5","Lots of information seems to get lost. You need to track everything to really know what's going on throughout the company. There's very little internal documentation, and what does exist is out of date. It's clear what you're rated on as far as promotions go, but there's less transparency about other aspects."
"6","Should come up with a better way to ensure different groups don't step on each others' toes, but still get work done without being bogged down by process."
"7","Hard to distinguish yourself as being a good engineer.  A lot of the day to day work is quite dull. Not very challenging most of the time.  Typically promotions go to people when they have been here a certain amount of time or are more pushy about getting them, rather than going to those who deserve them more."
"8","You need to differentiate more between telented people and less talented people.  Make people feel more important."
"9","Norwalk is not the greatest location."
"10","Keep listening to those under you."
"11","Decisions made by the upper management may not be transparent enough. Sometimes engineers are left in the dark about decisions which could affect them. Engineering roles in London are limited at present. Most of the roles are not very exciting and may make it difficult to progress career wise."
"12","Be more transparent."
"13","No beer in the fridge.  Too many men."
"14","Good recent acquisitions.  A single, universal platform would be better to market, as opposed to juggling user specific platforms.  Streamline development and support - bring resources together as opposed to allocating them across platforms.  There are some very smart people at this firm."
"15","Individual experience can vary widely based on manager.  Some managers work hard to help reports succeed, exposing achievements to upper level management and providing opportunities for growth and technical challenges, with proper feedback along the way.  Others not so much, which can be extremely frustrating if you'd like to get on the ""fast track."""
"16","Work harder to make opportunities more universally known and available.  Screen managers more carefully and provide better training so that they'll be better equipped to grow their reports professionally within the organization."
"17","A mon avis, le seul point négatif est que les clients vous traitent parfois sans le moindre respect car ils ont besoin de quelque chose immédiatement. Ceci se produit souvent du côté IB.
En dehors de ça, tout me satisfait.
Appart from this, everything satisfies me."
"18","La direction générale est juste et a beaucoup d'expérience, et je n'ai donc aucun conseil à leur donner."
"19","You have to work pretty hard; long hours and work/life balance is not the easiest to pull off.  But, if you like what you do, it is actually not bad."
"20","Senior management has actually weathered the financial crisis with great vision, and I am very impressed with the c-level officers/presidents of our company.  We are growing, despite being in a treacherous market for our customer base.  That is amazing."
"21","If you are a college grad there are a lot of managers your own age and experience level.  Office politics are significant.  While not stereotyping everyone, there is a definite sense that folks are there for their own good and team work is typically a barter of political capital rather than an immerse, fun experience"
"22","Listen to all employees.  Be involved with daily life, employees had little to no interaction with senior management, even at social gatherings when their ""favorites"" would just hover around them.  This isn't grade school - getting a gold star from teacher isn't going to help us beat Bloomberg and others."
"23","Political and promotions based more on popularity than work achieved."
"24","Promotions to management positions are given due to longevity at company as opposed to competency."
"25","After a year of hard work I got a very nice bonus, but no salary increase. I was told it's the economy. If they really valued me, give me some salary increase and some bonus. It would work out to the same this year. In 2010 when the economy is better is the only time they would see this increase. It tells me they only care about me for the short term."
"26","Meet with regular employees in NY, not in Norwalk. Get to know them.."
"27","Very long hours, nasty salespeople that never say thank you for the hard work you put in, but are happy to take credit for said work in front of management and clients.  Lots of inter-office politics (although it is a corporate environment so that's not surprising) and managers who shouldn't be managers.  There is also this attitude held by many senior Consultants that they shouldn't have to help you (being the new... guy) because no one helped them back in the day.  It leaves a very bad taste in your mouth.  They also coach young employees who have never worked at another company that there is no life after"
"28","Stop being so close-minded to change."
"29","Probably varies by group as well, but my group had silly ""salary caps""; bonuses are rolled into the annual increase (i.e. it takes 2 years to fully collect on busting your butt year 1)."
"30","Make sales listen to engineers -- not push ""this is how I sell the product, now support it"".  Make engineers learn how the products are used -- have to be better ways to support sales."
"31","Would rather have a better office in California."
"32","Can't think of any."
"33","Hours can be long. Compensation could be higher. I havent been around long enough yet to know how the compensation scale works as one advances within the company. Factset also does not have a ton of its own content."
"34","Need better Q&A for content. Content on the fixed income side needs to be ramped up so that we can compete with Bloomberg for the huge fixed income community."
"35","Bad employees are rarely dealt with, this can result in lower morale for the good employees."
"36","Deal with problem employees quicker.  Newer employees are more worried about their current money problems than long term, so while stock options are great for more senior people who aren't dealing with college debt, trying to buy a house, ect, newer employees are more interested in up front cash to help them through these issues."
"37","The salary is decent, especially when you start out working. But, you can probably get more elsewhere as time goes on and you become more experienced. Then again, you will have to work in a more stressful environment to get that higher salary, so it is up to you to decide what you want more. The annual feedback review process is annoying. You have to fill out a long for for yourself and a bunch of people you have... worked with during the year. The form is way too long with too many duplicate questions that you have to answer."
"38","Keep up the good work in terms of running the company, but watch out for smaller competitors. Be careful as you transition from being a small company to being a medium sized company. The friendly environment and culture is a big selling point of the company and it would be a shame if the company lost that as it grew and became bigger. Do something about the review process, it is annoying and takes up too much... valuable time that can be better spent elsewhere."
"39","Pay is not that great. Too many men. I feel like the starting pay should be a lot higher than it is. For a consultant it is 50,000. They could stand to pay at least 55,000. I am new so i am not sure what the bonus or pay schedule is. they obviously make a point of concealing that upon employment but it would certainly be some information worth reporting to make up for the lousy pay!"
"40","Spend more time with the people who are helping out the company... BETTER PAY!"
"41","Pas le lieu idéal pour une calme journée de travail de 8 heures"
"42","communiquez plus et soyez plus direct dans vos décisions. Devoir constamment attendre un consensus est épuisant."
"43","Weather can be harsh for those who didn't grow up in the area.  Cost of living is fairly high."
"44","Not application at this level."
"45","I don't really know of any."
"46","Keep up the good work!"
"47","hr is terrible at communicating things.  they screwed everyone over with the education assistance policy as well."
"48","bring back education assistance."
"49","Because of the rapid growth of the company and the exploding demand for many of our products, nearly every group is overworked and/or understaffed.  This sets a great stage for those interested in opportunities to step up and be noticed, but will severely unsettle those who are accustomed to ""quiet"" weeks."
"50","Keep up the good work."
"51","The biggest problem about working for FDS is that they're a financial company masquerading as a software company. Things move very slowly, even in the heart of silicon valley, and FDS's big banking clients are not receptive to any huge changes, which makes for slow, even outdated technological development. Beyond that, the company seems to value its salespeople more than its engineers, which makes for some... frustrating experiences as an engineer when dealing with upper management on even trivial issues. This issue is made worse by the San Mateo office location, which is a remote office and has to go back to headquarters for any significant decisions as well as higher promotional opportunities."
"52","Try to grow the San Mateo office; the silicon valley and UC Berkeley + Stanford is too good of a resource to ignore."
"53","somewhat large number of ""floaters"" - people who are not deliberative or who show poor leadership skills"
"54","more often, reward calculated risk-taking and honest reviews of performance (leadership skills are paramount) with pay increases"
"55","It's a do-it-yourself kind of atmosphere - there's no handholding.  This is a very positive thing, but it also means that if you don't take initiative, you won't move up the ranks.  Daily work can be difficult when you have no idea what the client is asking for.  Nobody here will just give you the answer, everyone works hard to try and figure things out on their own before asking for help. Don't get me wrong, plenty... of help is always available if you need it."
"56","Try to keep the company culture as laid back as possible.  The more we trend toward a staunchy corporate environment, the more your employees will act up and the less respect they'll have for you."
"57","FactSet does not seem to believe in formal education and if that is a big issue for you it is not a good place to be. Employees tend to progress on their own. Opportunities at FactSet usually means putting in the time career wise, so industry hires can sometimes be overlooked even though they may have great experience to bring to the table."
"58","Investing in the development of the company's biggest asset - people - should be a primary focus to take the company to the next level. As a technology company, not staying up to date with latest techniques, not just technologies, will allow smaller companies to catch up."
"59","big company, new york has a lot of tourists"
"60","Great Job!"
"61","Some departments are perceived as more valuable than others, which makes career advancement difficult in some roles."
"62","Continue to build the communications channel between management and employees; look beyond just Sales & Engineering for leaders."
"63","Need to have a better job description for consultants starting out, so they know what they are getting into."
"64","Keep up the good work"
"65","Some of the work particularly on the support side that you receive in Consulting can be boring or tedious at times.  Additionally, most of your pay does not come in the form of bonuses but rather in the form of straight salary.  There are random bonus' for different things such as completion of each CFA level but not in general unless you are in sales or some area of product development.  Additionally, it seems to... be hard to distinguish yourself as an employee in the short-run and often this is reflected in consultants under two years of tenure having very similar employee reviews."
"66","Having consultants get some sort of holiday bonus or fiscal year end bonus in addition to a raise."
"67","Some client facing positions require a fair amount of travel and extra work hours."
"68","Improve employee morale at the consultant level by rewarding those that work hard and actually firing/disciplining those that are not up to par.  It's hard to stay motivated when others around you do nothing and still get by."
"69","compensation could be better and the level of employee competence is somewhat variable.  the company mostly hires people right out of college, leading to a single-track mentality and a sort of cultish attitude.  that being said, if people leave the company, they are often welcomed back and management respects the new perspective that outside experience brings."
"70","management is somewhat conservative and single-minded in their approach, as most have spent the great majority , if not all, of their professional lives at the company."
"71","The Norwalk, CT location poses a challenge when hiring and retaining the best candidates."
"72","Continue communicating with the organization as often and as openly as you currently are, particularly in these more uncertain economic times."
"73","Once you're in sales you're stuck there"
"74","Keep on doing what you do"
"75","The location of the Headquarters is the biggest drawback.  Norwalk is unremarkable, traffic in that part of Connecticut is horrendous and the public transportation is challenging at best.

Sometimes the necessary formalism is overshadowed by learning, participation and getting things done.  This is great most of the time but frustrating when official career advancement becomes nebulous."
"76","I am in awe of your performance in this tumultuous market."
"77","Consistently long hours. I would like to be paid more. I don't have many negatives to say. Negative reviews would only come from poor performers who don't work hard or disgruntled employees of a company FactSet acquired."
"78","FactSet's senior management has all my confidence. They all carry themselves with humility, confidence and integrity. My advice would be to continue what they've been doing the past 5 years."
"79","FactSet suffers only from some similar problems to larger corporations, the occasional inability to look 5 steps in the future etc."
"80","Be proactive rather than reactive.  Reactive is our secure place, but we will need to drive further ahead to beat our already established competition"
"81","A bit difficult to make it here and be able to move around if you don't start as a consultant."
"82","I don't have a lot of access to senior management"
"83","Some departments are better than others.  Software Engineering is very highly thought of.  There is a lot of turnover in their Consulting (support) and Systems Engineering (IT) departments for various reasons.  Consultants are quickly promoted, IT seems to be a poorly run department from talking to folks within the department.  Consultants normally go on to become either sales or product development.  The product... development department, in particular, has excellent leadership and has done an excellent job attracting top talent from outside the company."
"84","Hiring outside the company for senior roles has worked out excellently for product development, they should consider doing the same for departments which may be performing poorly or could use some fresh ideas."
"85","It is a data driven company... somewhat boring at times"
"86","keep doing what you're doing"
"87","Compensation is unclear and only in first year, and some employees have low morale because job responsibilities did not meet expectations. Strong work and life balance but lack of motivational compensation like bonus etc. for hard work so far."
"88","Can't think of any advice."
"89","The salary is below par for people below managerial status. Compared to other companies Factset is severly lacking."
"90","better salary"
"91","Can't think of any right now."
"92","Keep up the good work."
"93","Everyone is young - and right out of college."
"94","You're doing a great job."
"95","The location of the headquarters, Norwalk, Ct isn't the best. There isn't a ton to do, however it is close enough to New York and not too far away from Boston."
"96","Nothing"
"97","The worst thing is that it is far from cities.
For some people who like suburban area it could be a good thing, but personally, as a young engineer, I would prefer more urban areas to live in."
"98","Share more information with the employees even if they are not good news."
"99","Working the helpdesk at the beginning of your career.  Compensation is just okay.  Also in terms of career advancement it is pretty much sales or a product specialist.  There are some advancement opportunities in management but that is limited."
"100","Senior Management does an excellcent job of running the firm and keeping its shareholders and employees happy."
"101","No performance-based compensation for consultants.  Others have fantastic compensation."
"102","Give Consultants a piece of the pie.  They do a lot of the dirty work in client managment and Sales reps reap all of the benefits."
"103","Beginning salaries are generally low and the office environment can be somewhat noisy making it difficult to concentrate at times."
"104","Offer training classes for more concrete skills.  At the moment, you can learn how to give presentations, write better email but what we would really need to do an effective job are technical skills such as scripting, database operations or using the development system more effectively.  On the other hand, perhaps such sessions could be arranged by us bypassing the training department."
"105","Jobs that are client facing can be tough since some of the people that you might work with are under high pressure and pass that pressure on to you.  This might result in working long hours but FactSet provides all the tools to help the clients out while minimizing the burden on you.  Management roadmaps aren't always clear and concise or when they are they don't always have status updates communicated downward. ... Working with older technology or hardware can also be quite frustrating however management seems to understand and are working to eliminate unreliable or outdated technology as budgets and end of life agreements allow."
"106","Remain open, communicate clear and concise plans, regularly update employees of plans, and communicate clearly to all managers expected response and involvement in achieving the high level plans while defining quantitative measures of success."
"107","No year end bonuses based on performance."
"108","Be more understanding to employees. Give them credit."
"109","Only thing that ever bothers me is the location, but that's hardly a problem in a relative sense, it's just a busy area."
"110","Keep it up, and make sure to stay just as level headed as the company gets bigger.  Continue asking managers to perform instead of just manage."
"111","If you want to be successful you pretty much need to give up everything outside of work (Other than socializing with coworkers at 11pm after work), even though there are few apparent rewards for doing so."
"112","FactSet is easily considered secretive, stuffy, and slow acting compared to the ""Glamor"" companies out there.

That is a pity as that is not how it was when you or even I started here. With the now thousands of people working for you, most with less than 5 years experience, please don't grow distant by surrounding yourselves with people who only tell you what you want to hear. 

Just because someone is low on... the totem pole doesn't mean that their opinion shouldn't be heard. 

Our culture of honesty and openess is easily eroded and could be destroyed if not continually tended to. 

A perception of high handed and out of touch management is still poor management despite the best of intentions, and it is a trap that can and should be avoided. 

I don't think that we're over the cliff by a long shot, although, some might say we already are, but there is growing dissent in the junior ranks who are only experiencing the ""diet"" or ""lite"" version of what makes us FactSet. 

By engaging them fully and openly we can prevent dilution of the core values and determination that got us to where we are today. Without it we lose the magic that makes us FactSet instead of being just like the monsterous, faceless, uncaring and intellectually bankrupt other companies that play in our space.

 The above focuses on the negatives, but it's easy to overlook the positives of your management that have got us to where we are now. It's not often you hear this, but thank you for doing a great job so far, and if you keep getting it right we can only continue to succeed."
"113","Disjointed organization, communication between department needs work. 

Issues with the competitive landscape of the industry. While being at a smaller company has many advantages in certain arenas it is difficult to compete with the resources and manpower of some of its top competitors. It is a case where the company needs to carefully pick their battles moving forward to avoid getting stepped on by the two... headed giant."
"114","Flatter structure. Our advantage is being the smaller and more flexible player in our field."
"115","Pay can be a lot lower at the start but no indication of how much potential there is. No one helps you so much with career progression, there isn't any advice given, but more a chance for you to create opportunities for yourself."
"116","good job."
"117","- Skills too thinly spread out
- Career advancement in ONLY Product Development, Sales or Engineering
- Management do not have the proper skills to become adequate managers
- No serious formal training for factors outside of the application"
"118","Please stop pretending that we can be buddies with our competitors. You need to realize that we are entering into a space of being a data provider, not just data delivery. If you think you can keep on eating Thomson Reuters Free lunches, then you are in for a huge surprise once you become the only data vendor with only one set of incomplete data to deliver. Also please recognize that we are a software company. We... need to invest heavily in our R&D and engineers to stay on top. We should not rely on requests from our clients as our R&D. If they have to request for something, then it's too late because chances are, someone already has that functionality. Our technology is dated & we need a revamp to stay competitive with other vendors."
"119","takes a while to progess through the ranks"
"120","provide better incentives to consulants"
"121","The real life at FactSet: Once hired out of college you are a ""consultant"". However for the first 6 months-a year you are on a help desk taking phone calls (till they decide to move this function to India). The next year you are actually a consultant. However you then have a choice. 

If you don't get poached by a client you career path could be ""specialist"". You then get a small bump in pay, still do help... desk/consulting work for a particular product but then have the additional goal of doing sales. They will also stick you with existing accounts. If you are new you are likely to get some account that are about to have canceled. These numbers will count against you raise/bonus time your first year. You will then be told, oh well, we had that too, just sell more to prevent it. However you will need to depend on the sales generalist to sell. If you have a complex product  you are then basically doing the sales job as well. Make a sale and the generalist will take credit. Don't make it, and it was your fault.

Your other career path is ""Account Executive"". Here you are a Jr Sales person working on existing companies rather than new business for a Sales Generalist. Again you will be given accounts in bad shape. Eventually you move to Sales Generalist where you just become another sales person till you have a bad year or two and then slowly pushed out.

The people who get treated decent are the Engineers and Development. The only issue in these roles is that your promotion is a little extra money and a nicer title. Real promotions take a long time and before you realize it you will be middle-aged and replacable by a 20-something year old. After-all for the first few years, you could be more senior, but you will have the same title as them.

The people telling you need to stay 5 years or so to get promoted want you to work cheaply and not move up for the next 5 years. At FactSet the rule is you can apply for a promotion after a year. However each time my particular manager would tell me how my position wasn't short-term and needed to be a long term 5-7 year position. They would tell me how they can't evaluate a potential promotion schedule until I'm in the position for 2 year. After 2 years of course, the promotion is in title, not really anything else.

The 3 weeks vacation is decent, but you end up working lots of additional hours. You really should get comp time for those hours.

There are other companies out there that treat their employees better."
"122","Many product groups have managers which is unfortunately made up of sales people with little experience with the product. They get put there because they sold general FactSet. This is the wrong structure. 

Our competitors have experienced people in the management of the group. How can a manager who knows little about the product supervise a specialist who knows more than him/her? Worst they managers drive the... enhancement/development agenda without knowing what's going on for the first year or two. Hire outside-experienced people to be manager of groups OR promote experienced specialists, not just the top-performing sales person of the year. Selling and Managing have little in common."
"123","2 years ago FactSet was a great place to work. The problem with a young workforce is they never saw a recession. Now everyone is scared for their jobs and their is backstabbing left and right.

With the Economy going bad, costs are being cut. People are disappearing left and right, but slowly, maybe one person a week. The problem seems to be some of these people were hard working, but made too much. A decent... company gives people a severance package layoff. But by avoiding a "" layoff"" and doing something gradual, these people are not being given anything. 

Benefits are also being cut. I noticed managers of 10 yrs having their blackberry being taken away. The blackberry increases productivity. Home internet (since many people work from home after leaving) is also no longer reimbursed. Cutting costs is a good thing, but not when you are cutting productivity with it.

Consulting and sales are being hit hard. Engineering and development are being spared.

Another problem is the FactSet way is to promote internally (which is good in moderation). The problem is this does not hold for all positions which require education and skills. I have noticed people one year out of college being promoted to very analytical positions to replace people who made too much. In the past, a client used to ask the consultants/specialist (who were experienced) questions. Now it seems the consultants/specialist are so new they are the ones asking the questions. What's scary is after a few years these people will probably be replaced themselves.

As the previous poster said, there's little of a career path. You may get a higher title and a little bit more money, but that's it. You are told to put in your time and be patient. But that's just to keep you there. When you are in your 30s and 40s and unemployed you better have done something during your time at FactSet (CFA, MBA?). Otherwise you will be wondering why you didn't take the job at Ernst & Young or Goldman Sachs like your friend out of college."
"124","Realize you need experienced people working at the company. Hiring college grads on the cheap is going to blow up when they can't probably troubleshoot issues with the analytic."
"125","And some not-very-good people. While once a great all-around company to work for, FactSet has entered the recession with the opinion that morale and experience are expendable. An up-or-out mentality has taken hold, and paycheck is the gauge. Experienced hard working individuals are pushed aside because, as a previous poster notes, they are perceived as costing too much. So complaints go up and quality goes down....
FactSet's layoff plan is truly a few at a time, as quiet as possible. Contra previous postings, development and engineering are affected, as are internal people. It's hard not to notice your colleagues suddenly missing and no one talks of them anymore.
Finally, while the CFA support is great, the actual advancement opportunities are minimal. There's a lot of titles, but the not much power in them. To work at FactSet is to find yourself running faster and faster, simply to stay in place. Better to put in 2-5 years and take your skills somewhere else."
"126","Stop hiring, stop firing (oops we mean ""laying off""), and remember that experience cannot be taught."
"127","I think the compensation from FACTSET is much less compared to its competitor. It doesn't have any bonus plans. Its located in a very expensive to live area."
"128","Leadership is generally good."
"129","Just like most other places, you have to know how to develop transferable skills by working on a mostly non-transferable knowledge-base. It is, after all, unique software built on proprietary technology where knowing all the little details gives you a decision-making advantage, but serves little purpose elsewhere."
"130","A little praise goes a long way for the underlings that are still learning to self-evaluate. It would be great if we could have more team-building events. Challenging SMART goals with pre-defined incentive are always welcome."
"131","Sometimes have to deal with impatient, and somewhat unreasonable clients.  But that can happen just about anywhere."
"132","No advice"
"133","Feedback from management is practically nil.  They're only recently decided to *start* adopting some industry-standard technologies (a bit late in the game, in my opinion).  A lot of the skills you learn there aren't really transferrable to other jobs as a result."
"134","Transparency, transparency, transparency.  There's too much cloak-and-dagger action going on and it takes employees by surprise often, sometimes to their chagrin."
"135","The worst part about FactSet is the management.  It's dominated by conservative white males who have no idea how to relate to most of the people in the company."
"136","Stop acting like this is high school and maintain this weird clique that you have.  Hadley and DiChristina are great but everyone else are kind of jerks."
"137","Some of the small company luster and feel has been lost. Management for eps under the veil of putting that money back to work through increased employee compensation. If your only interest is money, go elsewhere. If you're interested in community and life balance, may be a good fit."
"138","Management should embrace new technologies rather than relying on Outdated internal systems. Pitch to clients is buy vs build. Take your own advice."
"139","If you are not an engineer, professional growth opportunities and team-building workshops and industry conferences are non-existent.

Experienced workers with higher paying salaries need not apply. 

Company does not value intellectual property sharing. Uncollaborative stagnant environment."
"140","Although its admirable that the firm values long-term employees, I would recommend hiring in a consultant(s) to build team moral for managing employees through change and growth. Team workshops a must."
"141","Pay could be higher
hard to get promoted above someone who has been there longer even though you have worked for it.  Plus not a large opportunity to work very hard.
Hiring very fast and for above reasons everyone is replacable."
"142","Need to hire externally as most managers do not have experience of a manager role.  Need to pay more attention to the individuals and be proactive in asking what they are working on.  Managers are very friendly and approachable, but you are never certain of the truthfulness of their advice.  Generally very good!"
"143","The company lacks leaders in the engineering organization. It lacks them at every level of the organization. Nobody is in charge, nobody has a plan, nobody knows what they're doing beyond their own little fiefdom."
"144","The company needs strong leaders who will lead. There are too many people who have no idea what is going on, and no idea how they fit in with the company."
"145","- Possibility of getting pigeon-holed into certain specialties
- Compensation is average versus competitors
- Not hard enough with performance reviews meaning that people stick around longer than they should"
"146","More transparency, but overall a good job. Shake things up at the top more often."
"147","**Phil Hadley is clueless about a number of products. He only knows what he told by others. Most of the upper-mgmt just tell him what he wants to hear, hoping to keep on working till their screw ups get discovered. If he actually visited with the consultants and specialists, he would actually see what needs to be done to grow FactSet.

**It's all about selling. They will hire/promote you as a consultant or... specialist and tell you your job is account management. If you work on a hard product, you will then become the de-facto sales person. The sales generalist won't want to understand your product, so you will be doing cold calls rather than just building and strengthening existing clients/doing demos/trainings/support.. what you were hired for. Say you do get a lead by a cold call. Then you need to bring the generalist who has done very little. If it goes good, they get the credit. If it goes bad, you get the blame. 

**The company isn't good for a resume. If you put JP Morgan or Bloomberg on your resume it's gold. Putting FactSet on your resume doesn't do much.

People are extremely resistant to any changes and ""outside"" ideas. They say they want them but then are EXTREMELY slow to even consider them let alone implement them.

FactSet preaches about their culture but their culture is a bunch of really smart people that have minimal social skills... and experience. The culture is suffocating! If you aren't an engineer, consultant, or salesperson nobody cares about you. Doors to offices are always closed and its almost like a library in the cube areas. The silence is deafening. 

Breaking through the stubborn stuffy finance culture is a tough task!"
"156","FactSet needs more management training! They also need to open up the doors and loosen up! Make sure there is transparency throughout the organization and that people are collaborating cross departments. It would also be nice to hire from OUTSIDE the company to get some new fresh ideas and people that are willing to take chances on them!"

"163","Management does not know how to recognize and reward intelligent work.  Most engineers looking to grow have not, and will not find long term employment here.  As a previous poster states, you really need to be under the wing of an influential person in order to grow.  Also as previously stated, raises in the last few pay periods have been minimal.  Employees are being treated as a cost of the company rather than an... asset."
"164","Invest and reinvest in all your knowledge workers, not just some.  They are your most important asset.  When an employee is not given a fair raise for work that produced additional sales, it weighs heavily on the mind.  The cost of that loss of focus on work is much greater than conferring the deserved bonus."

"172","Stop accepting new hire slots haphazardly when there is no real career path intended for the role. Discontinue the backtracking and covering up of management mistakes by hiring new people to obtain theknowledge that you could easily discover yourself..it's not only wasteful but it's the reason you earn bonuses and have progressed so well at the firm in the first place

Put in more time, most higher managers work... 9-5 or come in early and leave at 5pm

Just because the company has done well and just because you have been there since it's pre-IPO days, does not give you the license to not work hard today.

Stop looking down at staff who haven't been there from inception or who have not been recruited from select schools. Continue to work hard in these down economic times....and give bonuses and compensation carefully, not just to those people who do the majority of the 360 reviews = oftentimes it's political."
"173","The corporate structure needs to be overhauled to provide more opportunities for consultants to progress within the company.  As it stands now, consultants are pigeon holed with current accounts and receive promotions by being in the right place at the right time.

"177","People disappearing everywhere.. In December some sales people who would always give advice and would work their asses off, were let go. They were FactSetters for life so I am sure being let go was a shock to them.

Now a bunch of people aredisappearing from the third floor in NYC. I heard they are being offer 1 month per year of service (including medical) with a 6 month max. That's pretty substandard as a few... years ago anyone let go (even people there a few months) was given a 6 month package."
"178","Keep the employees who worked their way up. Young people won't want to work for peanuts for several years to finally be given that great job, if they realize it will be a short term deal.

"188","Watch for who deserve promotions throughout the company at all levels, and make sure all managers are doing their jobs of recognizing their employees and promoting those who deserve it.

"189","Norwalk isn't the most interesting place in the world.

Engineering salaries are below average for a financial services company."
"190","The job of management is not taken seriously at Factset.  A lot of lip service is paid to how important it is to be a good manager, but at the end of the day, you are recognized for your individual contributions more than for your management contributions."

"192","Make sure the most competent employees are being promoted and not the best drinking buddies."
"193","There was a large reorganization that caused a massive exodus of employees out of the what you would call the old ""investment banking"" product development and engineering division out of the NYC office.  We have already lost some top notch employees and the trend will continue the next few months.  Many people are receiving much better compensation offers from other companies. Soon, there will be no one left in the... group.  In order for management to stop people from leaving, they will need to start increasing pay for the employees that deserve it.     

Compensation is much higher at Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters so I highly recommend applying there.  Capital IQ, Dealogic, IPreo tend to offer you slightly higher pay then what you're receiving at FactSet since they like to draw away from a competitor."
"194","Regardless if FactSet has been voted as a top company to work for, if compensation is not up to par with the market, people will continue to leave.  The only way to stop people from leaving now is for employees in the product development and engineering groups who have heavily contributed to high profile projects get mid year increases."

"198","Look at what the people under you can do and bring to the table. It is too often that good ideas are lost because we are not listened to."
"199","Being a new company some adjustments must be implemented during each quarter before one company can fully adapt to its environment. One of the problems in this company is that they already started to maintain everything and settling with what works in the past and expect that the trend and productivity will be the same.  They must first provide concrete structure before making it official and stick with that policy.... The most pressing problem is the location and size of the building. Situated in the heart of Taguig one of the new business centered area in the country but the main problem is the accesability of the area. Factset realizing the problem, provided scheduled shuttle service. But with the growth of the company and changing trends in the country the schedule doesnt seem to adapt to its environment ( the last trip to the company is 5:50 ) in which the main trasportation in the region (MRT) opens at 5:30. And most are resorting to waking as early as 4am just to arrive on time and some are just left with the option to ride a cab just to go to work. ( for entry level employees like me this is a big burden finacially) And with the growth in the number of employees shuttles service are becoming scare and the next shift that starts at 3:30pm are either coming in early or riding a cab to work. The developer of the area ""Megaworld"" already forsaw this problem and offered free shuttle rides around the area and ""peak hours"" scheduled bus rides in and out of the area in which the schedules of the company doesnt fall under. Second is the space. The area of the company if fairly small and with the additions of new employees it is becoming crowded and employees are cramming themselves in the pantry and facilities (lockers are shared and the company has a no bag to workstation policy) they have already started plans to expand its production to other floors. Third problem would be the Management of the company. In regards with the problems and countless suggestions by the employees (which are relayed from the team lead to the management) the response to the queries and recommended solution are kind of slow and employees are the ones who adjusts and suffer. Openess of the Management to suggestions or additional staff can eliminate this problem immediately. Last would be Employee turnover. This company is a good start to those with no experience but to maintain these employees are hard for the company because at one point the compensation are insufficent for one employee and most of the employees are just staying for experience."
"200","Regarding the Management of Factset in the Philippines I suggest to provide a survey regarding working conditions or suggestion boxes for the employees to give their opinion on matters regarding problems or possible solutions and Reviews of company policy in which conflicts with the working conditions of an employee."
"201","Being a company that primarily promotes from within, there are a lot of people leading the company who have not experienced environments outside of FactSet. This alone is fine, but it leads to a propensity to re-invent the wheel before carefully considering whether time-and-effort-saving industry-standard solutions already exist."
"202","It's encouraging that FactSet is starting to explore and adopt new technologies as it evolves its product. But in order to reap larger gains, we need to take innovation seriously and take bolder risks to enter new markets and expand the capabilities of our existing offerings. Our quarter-to-quarter EPS track record is important to keep up, but sometimes it feels like we cling to it instead of forging ahead with new... opportunities."
"203","* Limited career opportunities
* Old boy's club culture
* Untrained middle-management

FactSet's culture has changed.  It used to be inspiring, energetic, and team-oriented but now it's very every-man-for-himself.  There are fewer growth opportunities and so there is more jockeying for power.  It used to be that any smart person with a good attitude and work ethic could find a place for themselves at FactSet;... now it's the people with the aggressive personalities who succeed.

Veteran FactSetters are leaving - including our well-appreciated president - and the word is that they were pushed out, or shall I say conditions were created which made it more comfortable for them to leave than to say.

Some of the change is due to growing pains.  And part of it is that there are more managers, and managers have not been well-trained to get the best out of people."
"204","Focus on training your managers to be good leaders.  Good leaders create other good leaders."
"205","Management could have been better, although after my time at FactSet I believe they have started to make changes for the better."
"206","Place people in management who are capable of having a relationship with consultants."

"209","sideways movement
lack of innovation
Lack of inspiration and transparency in the management team but this seems to be coming from growing pains"
"210","Do not under estimate the cultural changes that are taking place. There will be a transition from employees who are at FactSet as they love the environment to employees who once payment is not sufficient will have no problems in leaving."
"211","Good start to a career, but the Consultant role is not what it used to be. Perks have been taken away in the recession (as with most companies) but promotions and movement within has been seriously decelerated."
"212","Progression through the Consultant role in order to change the way in which it is viewed must be made.  Instead of being a 1.5 yr role as it was when many were hired, their tenure in this position has been prolonged significantly and thus lowered the morale of the group."
"213","Improve raise system and pay"
"214","Pay better"
"215","The worst part of the job is knowing that you are in service to the evils of Wall Street.  It is easy to look past this for the sake of quality, enjoyable engineering.

FactSet also has to compensate engineers more generously in order to stay competitive with hiring/retaining quality engineers.  There is stiff competition in this regard from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc."
"216","FactSet does so many things well for its engineers, but just one year of poor compensation (when the company has plenty of cash on hand) can make employees jaded.  Once employees develop a negative attitude about their company, it can be hard to win back their faith.  And since compensation is done annually, that results in a whole year of employee bitterness: long enough time for some to start shopping around."
"217","Cultivates atmosphere of a ""FactSet Family"" while treating employees like a business"
"218","It's a 2 way street"
"219","- Flow of information from upper management can be non-existant/very patchy

"244","Development needs critical help. A lot of people from acquired firms get promoted to higher development positions even they are ill-equipped for the job. They carry with them their poor process and structure or lack thereof.

Products and databases should be well linked and not replicated. Also, I don't understand why we are paying money for information we already have in our database. Stop partnering with data... vendors with sub-par quality data. Just read the enhancement requests and you can hear the clients screaming at the quality of our products and lack of data integrity.

At the route development and engineering is going, small companies with better development process will eventually take over. We can at least gather quality data since that is our future."
"245","There is alot of internal politics. People who've been with the firm for long are favored, and not always the best performers. The levels of knowledge in finance, which is supposed to be the core business of the company, is very low, and the majority of people are  the 9-5 types who can't go for a beer because they need to feed the cat.  Very few ambitious people, but one gets the feeling that thats what is... preferred, and is reflected in the salaries, which stagnate once you join."

"260","Our product:

Take a good look at the engineering and development side of FactSet.  Our software is the core of our business and it is terribly slow, unreliable, and difficult to use.  It's tough to sell a product that crashes regularly during demos and is 10x slower than certain competitor products.  We need some serious development resources devoted to making our software quicker and more reliable.  Google takes... a fraction of a second to load a million search results, FactSet can take 30+ seconds to load one company snapshot page.

Compensation:

Compensation for consultants is not competitive, starting salaries have been the same since early recession.  We gain great experience at FactSet, and can apply these skills at other firms for a lot higher pay.  The end result is that great consultants leave which negatively impacts our ASV.  

Upper management takes seriously the idea of gradual, long term growth which is great for our investors.  Why not make it easier for employees to be investors? Our stock compensation plan is decent, but if in addition to higher pay direct stock compensation (not purchase plans) were available it would be huge in retaining key talent."

"262","There is not much clarity with your future at FactSet.  You can never get a straight answer from management about growth opportunities.  Compensation is a black box for sales, and aggressive sales people aren't appropriately rewarded for their efforts.  There is definitely a boys club here that doesn't welcome new members.  There is a lot of money that can be made for FactSet, but they fail to recognize the young... and eager that aspire to move up in the ranks."

"295","Know our clients.  Know our jobs.  Ask questions."
"296","The Admin guys are very lazy"
"297","No proper managment. No leadership quailty. No proper utilization of resources. No motivation or career advancement. No recognition of your work."
"298","Should know the process first. How to motivate employee. Should know how to handle resources fully. Should be goal oriented."
"299","Not too much job diversity, fairly specialized"
"300","Keep it up, so far so good"
"301","- Compensation is approaching the bottom of the barrel given the skill set of the employees and completely disregards cost-of-living changes in the economy or region, despite the company's relatively good performance in the market.
- Very weak and poorly defined career growth path for many software engineering positions.
- Employees promoted into management rather haphazardly and arbitrarily. The company tries to... solve this rather fruitlessly with management training.
- Many dead-end hiring positions setup arbitrarily without a care for how an employee can develop in that position. New hires: although there are some amazing opportunities at FactSet, be very weary of which position you interview for.
- Few non-managerial training options for software engineers."
"302","Make sure your employees have clear career paths and room to grow within the company. Don't look for the best software engineers in the industry just to put them into a dead-end job. Please consider how an employee would be able to grow in your team before wasting their time and the company's money. I cannot emphasize this enough.

While you get that first part sorted out, seriously reconsider the compensation... offered to your employees. Make sure money is an after-thought, so your employees can focus on developing themselves in the company, expanding their skill-set and start thinking about what is best for the company rather than how to get by."
"303","Poor pay - have felt underpaid from day one
Salary is very hush hush - feels like those who complain or threaten to leave get the bigger raises
Career path is DIY - don't get much guidance from managers"
"304","Please rethink the salary scheme since it's the main drawback to working here"
"305","QA department is woefully under-staffed
Product Developers have too much control over engineering - they often tell engineers exactly which projects to work on and how to do them"
"306","We are a software company, to succeed, you'll need to ensure that good software engineers want to work here.  Lack of support for engineering decisions from senior management and product development make the good engineers walk away."
"307","If you don't like travel, then sometimes the intercontinental trips can become tiresome, but that is something that is easily overcome. If you don't like open offices that foster communication between teams and team members, then you can always put on some headphones and listen to some tunes."
"308","Not much, only to continue the great levels of transparency so that the teams that deliver the vision can continue to feel like stakeholders in the process."
"309","Pay is not as good as the banks (although it is close), this is a software company, if you want to work all hours of the day and be rewarded with a huge pay cheque then go to a bank. FactSet makes up for this by being focussed on engineering and encouraging a good work / life balance.

The company can be a little slow in identifying poor performers and acting on this, which can seem unfair if you are doing very... well."
"310","Really, the main thing FactSet needs to do is to get its name out to potential employees. Most people I speak to have never heard of FactSet and this puts them off joining when they have an opportunity at a better known company. Overall, I think they would probably be better off at FactSet and the company needs to do more to stop this being a factor."
"311","Very few are motivated to do the right development thing"
"312","Value software development more ,long term software development that improves infrastructure is a good idea."
"313","Compensation is also a con, because it could be much higher.  It's important to keep in mind though that Factset doesn't ask too much of their engineers so paying them top dollar would be silly.  There's a lot of turnover in upper managment in the software department and it feels like most people view Factset as a stepping stone instead of a career."
"314","More emphasis on creating a culture that excels at giving feedback, trust your employees and treat them accordingly.  Find EFFECTIVE ways to make Factset a place people want to wake up everyday and work at, not one they put up with because the lifestyle is good"
"315","employee morale is falling, attrition is rising, bureaucracy prevents rapid innovation from happening, key talent is getting ready to leave while the company worries more about recruiting than employee development and retention, little motivation to go above and beyond"
"316","Some recent policies intended to control operating costs have caused resentment, jealousy, and infighting between groups. Senior management is widely perceived as being out of touch with lower level employees."
"317","- Compensation and promotion policies here are a mystery 
- If you ask questions, you will hear the same generic answer from all levels of management over and over again
- Pay is sub-par, with no performance bonus and small raises
- You will not be rewarded for working hard
- Has become more bureaucratic in past couple of years"
"318","Work on employee development rather than recruiting.  Pay employees competitive salaries or bonuses and quality of the product will increase"
"319","Somewhat risk averse culture - the big idea might never get realized but the small incremental ones will. Some view the company as a starting point, not a long-term career option which can have a negative impact on the morale of the best performers."
"320","Continue to communicate large initiatives down the chain. Continue to pursue process improvements as well as new, quality  revenue opportunities."
"321","- Previous employees have used FactSet as a stepping-stone. I believe this is partially due to the fact that they are no longer being challenged. Engineers love challenges and you can only go as far as to create your own, but then what after?
- Salary inversion.
- With certain managers, you must constantly remind them how hard you work.
- The recent hiring blitz has introduced some less than qualified engineers... into our talent pool.
- Some product developers are very capable and easy to work with; others are rude and constantly demanding or incompetent.
- There's no such thing as a free lunch. It's part of our total compensation package and the quality of the cafeteria has been declining. Some employees avoid the cafeteria altogether."
"322","Pay attention to what your current employees have to say -- We are your best asset. We've endured long hours, cutbacks, and economic crisises."
"323","Bad compensation. Departments are disjointed, you could have no idea what the person next to you does"
"324","Too Crowded
Queues in the Canteen (Queues everywhere)
Its a call center. Not a software company
Hardly any innovation. Using old windows 32 API to develop user interfaces.
Don't join the C++ /SQL team.
Not enough diversity. Disengaged workforce.
Horrible location. The DLF building in Hyderabad is too crowded and small."
"325","None. Stop being a typical financial services company. Try to upgrade your technology. Improve your canteen/infrastructure services."
"326","Management  (at least in my office) was very strange-- Catty, gossipy, and not very confident.  In fact, there were too many managers and it was not really very clear to most what each did. I know this sounds common, but the office went through many changes that were never really explained and  most were afraid to voice concerns out of fear of retaliation. The office was a place were smart, hard-working consultants... were not rewarded and sub-par consultants who did not rock the boat were quickly elevated. This resulted in many of the smartest people leaving for greener pastures. In fact, my office alone saw huge levels of defection to clients and other companies. Most left to either (1) make LOTS more money ( myself included) or (2) go somewhere where they felt appreciated  and intellectually challenged."
"327","Top management needs to bring in experienced managers and not just promote top-performing salespeople to management. Just because someone was a good salesperson does not mean they will be a good manager. High levels of attrition in any office in a short period of time should be a red flag that something is wrong."
"328","May get stuck with a boring project"
"329","Document your software (internal). There could be some standards set in place or a designated person to review and document software. This is especially important for internal software as this is heavily used to help run the company. Overall, I respect FactSet, its policies, and my current compensation."
"330","After consulting, you have opportunity to move on to another department or into management, but if the options don't suit you, you hit a dead end as you very quickly realize you are ""outgrowing"" consulting.
Also, the structure of management in consulting is such that managers aren't directly involved in the accounts you, as a consultant, work on.  So they know little to nothing of the accounts beyond what you tell... them.  It is hard for them to understand the difficulties to face and try to help."
"331","Dictator rule at Hyderabad
Process adherence in processes is a distant cry
Favoritism, no uniform policies for all groups and levels
Promotions are not based on merit.
Performance management is an eyewash, another task to be completed and nothing more.
Very high employee turnover, no attention to that aspect by management"
"332","Some soul searching required in the way employees are treated. India and Hyderabad market is a ocean of opportunities and if FactSet continues to run the organisation the dictatorial way, doomsday is not far away."
"333","Rigid promotion requirements hinder top performers from faster recognition (for some teams, not all), pay is average to below average for the financial software industry in NYC, in-house technology-oriented training not at the level of managerial training, an initiative needs to be developed to help PDs and engineers collaborate better (I'm serious about this), working in the financial software domain means you... don't really understand the end-user (unless you are a banker or money manager), some teams have pager / on call duties, specialization means cross-team moves are less likely."
"334","FactSet is the best place to work in the financial software industry, despite its shortcomings. I qualify this because the industry may not have the mass appeal as some others such as consumer-facing industries or social networking companies. Nothing you can do about that. Recommendations: make the promotion structure more fluid for high-performing engineers. Pay PDs more, they deserve it. You are not a mediocre... company but you pay like one; raise your average pay to be in the top 10-15 percentile in the industry. You have a ton of free cash flow, make sure you do everything you can - not only pay, but also benefits, promotions, training, and compelling work - to keep your top performers motivated and challenged."
"335","Norwalk location is not the best.  Opportunities for personal/professional growth can be hard to come by."
"336","Need to expend their domain."
"337","Nothing"
"338","Beaucoup de mauvais managers et FactSet manque très souvent de volonté pour résoudre le problème ou n'en n'est pas conscient. Ils sont ravis de chasser l'incompétence au bas de l'échelle alimentaire mais n'osent pas le faire aux plus hauts niveaux."
"339","Rendez la révision des salaires un peu plus transparente - et imposer des quotas sur les suppléments de performance n'est vraiment pas une bonne idée."
"340","- There is a pervasive absence of an innovative spirit
- Compensation is low relative to other employers of similar talent
- Engineering interests take a back seat to sales goals and the infrastructure suffers
- There is often a push to deploy features before they're well polished"
"341","Don't forget that the company is successful because of its software. If you don't push for innovation at all levels you will not continue to displace your competitors."
"342","The only downside I could observe in my 1 year career is its compensation to satisfy an employee of enough worth."
"343","D not let good resources go out of hands with your knowledge just of their dissatisfaction on their compensation."
"344","Low Compensation, facilities need to be improved..."
"345","-no clear and long term career path
-no fairness across departments (some departments are well-treated, while others are not)
-too ad hoc and no structure in place"
"346","-too much emphasis and investment on offshore teams. I would prefer if the management is upfront and transparent about the direction. It is pretty obvious that we want to cutback on the employeees onshore."
"347","Sales is non-Commission based, high performers not rewarded enough"
"348","Very demotivating environment. Delegation is very poor. No ethics followed by some of the Managers. Attrition level is very high."
"349","Improve the leadership level..Because people do not leave companies, they leave managers.
Provide more learning opportunities for the employees also."
"350","I have seen good work go unrewarded.  There seems to be a lack of personal career growth, lacking promotions, etc."
"351","Keep up the encouraging words, but follow through with advancing opportunities to good employees if you want to keep them around!"
"352","Some ideas are not taken seriously that would increase efficiency and productivity
Management unwilling to help those that want to advance"
"353","Give employees a chance to advance within the company, especially the ones who show that they are willing to expand their skill set and care about the growth of the company."
"354","Compensation, compensation, compensation.  I received a handful of offers and all of them were more then what FactSet was paying me.  To be fair, it's management strategy to keep costs low.  I don't fault them.  It's just plain facts.  Work/life balance is fantastic there so it's a sacrifice most existing employees are willing to make.  I figured I'd join the rest of the crowd who complain about salaries at FactSet....

On another note, I noticed employees who come through acquisitions are under qualified for the positions that were handed to them on a silver platter.  It's absurd to me how little some of those people know about FactSet.  There should be a yearly quiz on how to write a simple =FDS code.  You'd be shocked at how many ""managers"" in the company sneak by without knowing it.  Shocked.  You know who you are.  You shammers."
"355","I still hold a ton of FDS shares so keep those costs down.  I'm happier now that I'm a shareholder and seeing everyone complain about salary.  I know management is keeping shareholder interests at heart!  Keep driving that ASV!

Consultants should be paid a tad more.  Troopers.  I feel for all of them."
"356","Salary and compensation aren't close to market rates
Not enough recognition from management"
"357","Stay true to the vision of Chuck and Howard and avoid trying to change over to a Thomson model of personnel or acquisition."
"358","Keep fighting the good fight and continue to keep bringing in members of the consulting to the product management and engineering teams."
"359","Salary is lower compared to other companies. Some admins are not good. You have to fight for your benefits. That's all."
"360","I dont think we are paid as well, but not sure"
"361","there is not necessarily a sense of urgency in the firm, it is a conservative culture, and therefore you can reach a glass ceiling relatively quickly. It's also of such a size that beauracracy is now well embedded."
"362","Learn to be more responsive or you're likely to be overtaken as several firms have already done."
"363","Company is getting bigger fast and red tape is increasing.  Communication from the top borders on dismal as the firm continues to grow.  Top of the company is a bit of an old boys club and the performance of some of that group is questionable."
"364","Communication is key."
"365","Limited number of career tracks"
"366","low pay.
 they dont know how to treat financial engineers. Your niche skills are considered no better than a software engineer. Its a software company and its view of mathematical modeling is writing code!!!!!
No career path defined and joining diffeent teams is riven with red tape."
"367","churn is owing to low pay in financial engineering.
You cant rate a financial engineer alongside a software engineer while yearly appraisals. Its naive.
Give people with appropriate skills the appropriate job to do."
"368","Difficult to connect ""piece"" and ""responsible person"". There is almost no common general procedures like deployment and support."
"369","The consultant position is very mundane work where you have to solve everyone else's problems. This position teaches you close to zero skills that are transferable to other positions in finance. In any position at Factset, but primarily at the consultant level, you are dealing with problems that wall st does not want to deal with. A typical problem is ""my numbers in Factset don't match Bloomberg's, can you help me?""... I would highly not recommend this job to anyone with any ambition to make it in finance. Do not be fooled when they tell you that you can move up in the company and that CEO Phil Hadley started at the consultant level. From the consultant level, you either move into product development or a junior sales role. I worked at Factset for a year, and while I was there, I watched 6 consultant quit their jobs to move onto better opportunities. In short, Factset breeds complacency and can not retain any talent within the company."
"370","When clients provide feedback like ""Factset's numbers are always off,"" I would take note and fix it instead of justifying how they are actually right. Most of the management have the Bill Lumbergh personality."
"371","Low salary base package.And small minded outlook among peers."
"372","Most of the reviews on this website pretty much sum it up.

The work is cumbersome and trivial. None of the work is intellectually stimulating and there is no incentive/reward to try. The management team expects you to go the extra mile for every client no matter the  request. That is understandable, but you quickly realize that most of the required solutions make no practical sense.

This is a software company... that tries to disguise it's ""consulting"" role as a finance related role. None of what you do is finance related. It is more backoffice IT support. You don't learn much after training as almost all clients call in with the same menial requests.

If you are a motivated/hardworking/smart individual this is definitely not the place to grow and develop."
"373","The company culture seems to be focused on being mediocre and learning to stick with the illogical. Learn to focus on what matters (practical solutions)."
"374","Not a great deal of creative freedom on projects, or places to input new ideas and/or suggest new projects if you're new.  Cafeteria food varies in quality, but free is free is free.  Fairfield County, CT can be expensive (although some parts are nice to compensate).  Pretty hierarchial in structure.  Engineers don't strike me as being miserable, but neither do they seem wildly happy."
"375","It would be nice if newer engineers had a chance to think more entrepreneurially and propose/start their own projects where necessary or desirable (think Google), even if this in some cases required longer hours.  Structure of the company feels rather rigid, overall."
"376","Consulting can get mundane after a year"
"377","I haven't found anything I don't like about the company."
"378","work can be monotonous after a while.

"390","- Depending on the department, work can be occasionally tedious and redundant.
- As a corollary to the previous statement, it is hard to pinpoint potentials for career growth.

Those who plays their games will be noticed but not those who... focus too much on their works. As a result, many people learned to do just enough work to keep their jobs.

Hiring more newly grad to replace the void does not solve the problem either. A good engineer will be bored and quit eventually."

"465","bad career choice if you intend to ""learn"" anything in finance.
Extremely low pay especially if they sense that you need a visa.
Not a value addition to your resume in terms of brand name.
This is a software company that thinks that it can solve finance problems by writing code. The attitude percolates through the management ranks.
If you are an independent thinker, you cant progress here as they want people who... say ""yes"".
No culture of modeling,research and no tradition of hiring smart people who can bring outside perspectives.
They misrepresent the nature of work as Financial engineering when all you will be doing is to write code and debug legacy code.It is actually financial development and a very poor development experience too at that."

1) Very cliquey, non-flat/communicative, to the point of hurting business.  
2) The Peter Principle, people are promoted to their level of incompetence.

Managers largely are promoted who were decent at their old role, and with the company the longest.  Since the company grew rapidly over the past, you see this many places.  Leaving managers who can't really manage, think, or inspire....  A huge determent to the employees below them, and company as a whole.  To secure (or justify) their job, they create processes that are not the most efficient, and they are basically there to just barely manage personal relationships.  At the worst, they are not recognizing the talent below them.  This exacerbates the non communicative problem.  This has gone on for so long because of the practice of hiring people out of school, no one questions.  All of the best talent is hired away, left with the worst and least motivated."
"472","Ironic here.  I think the advice to management, would be to actually listen to advice, from your company at all levels.  

When a consultant suggests (through the appropriate channels) to build an app, it sets a tone (to all the middle managers) when the upper manager of the company replies harshly that this would never be done because there was no value in doing this, alluding to all the points that the junior... person failed to see.  These types of actions perpetuate the growing pains for the company.  Even if this idea was later adopted, and the request/exchange expunged from the database, people become paralyzed from promoting good ideas.  You are left with yes men, and a company that is much like a barbell portfolio.  (Not much in the middle, lots of older execs (with a flawed vision), and younger college grads (incapable of really executing))

Stop hiring everyone (especially engineers) immediately out of college.  A strength of the company has been it's service, and the caliber of the people, however as the company has grown, people have been promoted and have become career managers and have lost touch with the product.

I believe all, or most of the upper management has only worked at this company.  They need to seriously shake stuff up.  There is no real plan (another writer quotes 'the next double' which is illustrative).  The company has atrophied from it's historic key strengths.  Hard for some to see the forest through the trees.  The perspective is lost because there is none. 

My real aggressive advice to management would be to try to take the company private, do an overhaul cleaning of the structure/mgmt, make things flatter, promote good ideas and give employees credit for ideas and room to act on them, foster more communication, evaluate the serious opportunities and threats in the industry, buy an OMS or some way of becoming fully turnkey, and take on BBERG and all other competitors.  ....Or just rest easy knowing you can retire easily, by not really having to change much, regardless of the outcome of the company."

I've gone days without speaking to anyone.  Collaboration with your team is minimal.  Everyone is given their own project and sent... to work on it by themselves.
* Don't expect to be challenged here.  After one year, I had only ever worked on one project.  
* Working harder/faster gets you no where.  All that ends up happening is you'll have lots of free time to sit around doing nothing.

- What FactSet was doing 20 years ago was state-of-the-art. The environment that we operate in today is archaic. Engineers have to put a lot of effort in to simply maintain what we have. They also will not typically get experience in what is the industry standard.
- We can't... simply switch to what is state-of-the-art today because FactSet's clients do not like change. Over the years, bugs have become features. It is extremely difficult to make major infrastructure improvements, even if that means we fix bugs in the meantime.

Work-life balance is good, but more can be done to improve it.
- Many engineers have on-call responsibilities. Senior management and people in other departments do not appreciate how difficult it can be to work all night and then have to work all day.
- Having been at FactSet many years, I have seen perks diminish and go away entirely. I suppose these are natural growing pains, but I wanted to list these things anyway.
  - Home internet reimbursement for people with on-call responsibilities.
  - The ability to invite a date / spouse to the holiday party.
  - A summer picnic.
  - Lunch on Fridays.
  - The lunch subsidy is not increased for inflation.
  - Tuition reimbursement. (Used to be 100%. It went away entirely, then came back capped at what FactSet can deduct.)

These complaints are far outweighed by the positive side of working at FactSet. Overall, I am a happy employee."

It is very stressful for an unwell person to go to the hospital/clinic and to wait uncomfortably for his/her turn in the doctor's office just to secure a medical certificate. I was even reprimanded by a doctor one time when I went to him in a sickly state just to secure a med cert. In the end all I got was an advice to get plenty of rest, water, and some paracetamol.

Many roles are being off-shored

Employees promoted based on time with the... company so that many managers do not have any management skills and do not know how to work as managers overseeing a team. The company tries to give them training, but managers behave the same after the training. Managers do not motivate staff and do not help them grow by giving them added responsibilities.

Many employees are moved around since the company has a lot of restructuring. This increases the likelihood of employees leaving or of HR pushing them out due to not enjoying their new roles, teams or managers. For example, some people with 6 years at the company may have 6 different managers in that time. Terrible managers stay with the company even with bad reviews because of the time they have put in while good employees get pushed out if the manager does not like them. 

Advancement is limited particularly around 3-5 years with the company.

Tuition reimbursement is a lie. Some teams can use it and others cannot but their isn't any clarity about the rules to request the funds or who can get it. Apparently their is a sort of wait-list, but it isn't posted so no one knows who is on it or not allowing for preferential treatment of certain employees to get it. In addition to the ""list"", your manager also has to approve the course as being directly related to your role, which some managers may not do even when your role requires the information from a job related course.

- There is some resentment of software engineers by the non-engineers at the company (who make up most... of FactSet's workforce). The resentment stems from the fact that the engineers are paid more despite having lax dress standards and flexible hours.

Your experience at FactSet for your first 1.5 years will be determined by how lucky you are when placed on a team, and your experience after that will be determined by your political finesse."
"730","Let people move between teams more freely - this will definetly help you retain talented people. Clean up the technical cruft!

"743","Pay: After realisation of the competitiveness in other companies, I realised pay here is definitely not matching software companies in London. As years went by, I realised that people in other companies were receiving bonuses and also larger pay rises which made me sceptical of the salaries here for Software Engineers. Alongside that fact, in company wide meetings we were all told that Sales would receive a... ""Chairman's Club"", which meant they would have luxurious settings in Europe, US etc for meetings when they met their targets - meaning Software Engineers were angered and frustrated by this.

People: Regarding the management, it seems managers are not assessed, they are given the role of manager when they have been here for some time rather than actually accessing their skills. I think a real interview process is necessary when deciding who should become a manager - not word of mouth or ""You have been here some time and proven you're a good Software Engineer"", leading code and people are two different things.

Environment: The company promotes a start-up culture but that is beginning to fade as policies are being put in place that is beginning to remove this kind of culture. 

Technologies: As a Software Engineer that had been in the company for many years, newer, transitional, technologies are now being brought into the company which I do not have much experience with - meaning when looking for new career choices in Software Engineering they are limited due to the older legacy technologies where most of the time was spent when coding. 

Career: Motivation is key, unless you are self-motivated, work can become mundane. At times exciting projects arise but if you demonstrate that you are a trustworthy employee, the company will rely on you to do tasks that are irrelevant to your personal goals and achievements you wish to reach."
"744","Assess Management - Interview processes are necessary when choosing potential managers.

CFA certification is relevant to consultants - Look at giving Software Engineers specific certifications for the technologies they work with; recognition.

See problems, solve them. Some deep-laying issues go unrecognised until the problem becomes too large to deal with. Try to see this and keep in touch with employees....

If you are ambitious, you better be interested in a career in sales. If not,... this job can feel like a dead end."

It can get very stressful and... aggravating handling 15-20 calls a day in which you are doing a lot of the work for your clients or answering mind numbingly easy questions. 

Management does little to inspire and motivate workers and will take any opportunity they can to criticize your work. Reactive is the best word to describe your day to day tasks as issues come up and clients call with problems. If you do not handle stress well DO NOT take this job.

"837","They mostly hire people straight out of college and train them the way they want them. Consequently, as an experienced engineer, I didn't have much opportunity to work on new things. I got stuck in a boring group working on boring libraries. I asked to be transferred several times to no avail. Since most of the people don't have much industry experience, they make some stupid design decisions. Everything has the... ""must be built here"" syndrome, including the web servers that run the new application infrastructure. That's just asking for security issues. The pay is not quite competitive for experienced engineers."
"838","The interview process was a giant lie, they go on about how you will have a great work/ life balance and only work from 8:30-5:30. In reality you are working at the office until 7pm or later most days. On top of this you also have projects and client work you have to take home and work on in your free time and weekends. They constantly schedule meetings during your lunch hour, which you don't get anyway because you... have so much work you are expected to always work through it. 

The job role itself is a glorified call center agent with you often feeling you are chained to the desk. (This is not a finance role, no matter what they tell you.)They scare you to make you feel like you can not go on ""not ready"" making you feel like you can barely nip out to go to the bathroom. This only gets worse after Accounts Academy, you will now have 8 hours of phones a day plus clients. Every minute of your day is taken trying to juggle clients requests, phones, schedule client meetings, then manage trading your phones so you can go to these meetings.

Management is terrible, they lack communication and management skills. They promote in FactSet for how long you have been with the company not with what skills you bring to the table. Meetings with your manager can be painful and they take every opportunity to criticize your work.

If you want to work in Finance go somewhere else, no one knows what FactSet is, this job has very few transferable skills to help you get a job elsewhere. After being a consultant for 2 years you only have two career options in the company; move into Sales or Product Development. Most people are looking for other positions well before this. Most consultants I spoke with have one foot out the door after Accounts Academy, this is when they all realize the job, stress, and workload are not worth it. 

Do NOT work here, go somewhere you will feel valued, appreciated and intellectually stimulated."
"839","Do not lie during the interview process. If the recruits actually have a real grasp on what sort of work they are going to do the turnover will be lower. 

Train your managers, don't hire them just because they have been there the longest. Most are extremely incompetent making a terrible work environment. 

Treat your consultants better, they are working 65+ hours a week for you. Actually recognize their work... and don't just tell them their workload is manageable, when you know it is not. Offer help, I'm sure the managers remember how they felt when they were consultants."
"840","I can't think of any. Bigger pay, perhaps? Other venues for the holiday party besides Sofitel?"
"841","less compenstion, no carrer growth, Senior managment not at par"
"842","There is no clarity on career paths and compensation growth. There is also no consistency between offices, divisions, groups and then teams. It almost seems unfair if you are in the wrong group or office and compare yourself to the others."
"843","To retain your employees, create consistency between groups and pay them a competitive salary."
"844","Compensation - you only get paid to do your job not excel, which is disincentivizing
Sr managements ability to set goals, transition processes, then follow-through
Forced ranking seems like a way to not recognize employees and doesn't show that management values ther employee's achievements
Lack of company and leadership diversity
When changes are made, everyone is thrown in the fire right away, no adjustment... period
Company goal setting can be vague, unrealistic, and there is difficulty with measuring performance and providing clarity for employees"
"845","There needs to be more diversity within senior leadership
When people excel, pay them, don't just give a pat on the back and say thank you. There are a lot of high achievers so one way to distinguish given the disparity of goals is based on the impact of the achievements to the company
Forced ranking and male to female opportunity disparity and recognition need to be addressed
Sr Management can be out of sync... with market and times and are not ""on the floor"" enough to be in touch. 
Work life balance is cited often, and FactSet has a lot of flexibility but sometimes the lack of support resources can make people feel overworked.

Increased willingness to cut corners to get product out the door."
"849","with growth coming back, compensation adjustments should follow suit. whilst the market helps, its the current employees that are helping capitalise.

"855","At Management levels, there is a over-control and lacks flexibility to explore and experiment. Even a simple idea has to be sold to minimum 5 different people with varied thoughts to finally have it implemented within your team.

"861","Pay scale can be better"
"862","Management can exhibit strong nepotism in their promotion decisions."
"863","* Huge inconsistency in how various teams and departments are run, so the overall quality of one's general work experience can be hugely dependent on the luck of the draw when one is assigned to a team (such as when initially applying and being hired).
* Engineers are generally kept very much separated and isolated from other departments, especially the sales side, so required interactions (to respond to client... issues and the like) can sometimes be somewhat tense and unpleasant due to the general social psychological principle of communication with an ""Unfamiliar Them"" often being more difficult and more prone to misunderstandings and latent subconscious attitudes about dealing with another group that one perceives is treated wildly differently from oneself.
* A very outdated codebase that as an Engineer, one will frequently have to dig through to implement a requested change or bug fix, including, but not limited to, code written for an OS that is technically obsolete, with much of the current Engineering work being part of a multi-year effort to completely remove the reliance on this obsolete OS by re-writing code to be compatible with Linux.
* Company-wide move to converting all office space to open-floor plans leading to increasingly noisy and distracting workplace.
* Engineering advancement seems to largely fizzle out after one makes Senior Software Engineers, with a combination of hard work, managerial/people skills, and luck required to be offered any real expansion in role or responsibilities beyond that point."
"864","Give Engineers a better sense of what's going on in the company at large, instead of fostering a culture where Engineers are basically kept in an isolated bubble. Also, promote interaction and increased familiarity (cross-departmental team-building/professional development/company morale events and the like) between members of different departments, as there IS a need for members of different departments to actually... interact with each other during the course of business, and those exchanges will be much more productive and pleasant if everybody if there was a general sense of familiarity instead of the current atmosphere where it sometimes feels like members of different departments might as well be employees of a totally different company."

"878","NOT a finance job! Do not believe how they sell it, this is a consulting job for software, not finance. Expect to know/learn how to code in the software. Decent first job salary but low for any expienced hire. Very poor management! Majority of managers started when company was young and are only in their positions due to seniority. Very little actual management experience and it shows. Very little room for... advancement as promotions are based on seniority rather than performance. Best employees leave within a year or two tops."
"879","Restructure management to bring in experienced managers. Too much internal bureaucracy, and ""homework"" presentations that distract from what should be the true focus, building client relationships. Begin promoting based on performance rather than seniority. Lose your best employees after a year or two as a result."

Consequently FactSet focus almost exclusively on... hiring new college graduates who don't have the political experience to navigate the tricky Stack Ranking process properly, and don't teach or warn them upon hire.

"896","Show consultants that you appreciate them and think about offering ways out of consulting if a consultant is unhappy. Also, allow consultants to switch offices (you lose talent this way).

Too much of internal politics to push back work. All managers try to please each other instead of focusing the real work done. There are always some re org changes going on.

Year-over-year compensation... increases are often laughable, and internal promotions lead to insulting bumps in pay. Well-qualified and Senior engineers who do not come directly from college or from an external company are paid FAR below company averages.

"1141","Know what you're getting into--this is NOT a finance job no matter how they spin it, it's a tech support job that revolves around financial data.  When I was working it was phones support all the time.  My friend who still works there says that they now have instant messaging.  You'll be on phones or instant messaging minimum 5, sometimes 8 hours a day for your first few months.  If you get a call you're expected to... figure out the solution on the fly.  If you can't you'll have to get back to the client, and then go on ready for another call.  As you might guess your workload just piles up more and more unless you figure out a system on your own to stop that.  There's a app that monitor's everybody's time on phones, how many calls they took and other stats.  You'll feel like you're being micromanaged--because it's true.  If you are stressed out easily, DON'T apply here.

Once you move onto accounts and have your own clients, don't expect the workload to get any easier.  There can easily be 300+ clients that you're responsible for supporting.  If they have a question on how to build a formula or format a graph, the burden is on you to get it done.

For 90% of the time your clients are the ones who are doing the analysis, and you are the tool they'll be using to get that analysis done.  Many times you will feel like you are being used by your clients.  It doesn't come as a surprise that during my first few months working there 4 or 5 of my collegues who were hired around the same time as me left to pursue better opportunities.  I should have left earlier, as I was looking for a true finance related job.

For the first year you'll be working--a lot.  They may say during the interview that there's a great work life balance, but more often than not meetings/reviews/online classes will be scheduled during your lunch hour.  Lunch ""hour"" is more like Like ""half-hour"" as 4 out of 5 times you'll still be on phones.  If you get a call at 12:29 it's your duty to stay on until that call is done; if that call ends at 1:00, well, you're lunchtime just got cut 30 minutes.

I was easily working over 60 hours when I started, and I know some of my colleagues who were working even more, especially when their client requests piled up.

As many other reviewers said, there is little room for advancement if you don't want to go into sales down the road or product development.

Salary -- below industry average, with rent easily 18,000 a year where I lived, that was a third of my salary gone."

What is 0.01% increment? Does company has any idea of work and life balance? One day bringing family members to work place doesnt balance work... and personal life. Why even after so many people complain about bad food which is charged unnecessarily is still being served. Performance evaluation is just for name sake, to be entirely honest its totally based on management's decision. Ranking has nothing to do with performance. Team leads and Assistant manages and operational managers and even vice presidents of this company has no idea about what is their process and how it works, they just tend to deal with it as sales and marketing. 90% of employees are recruited from rural areas for whom getting a job is more than enough and dont bother about pay, promotions.

I was extremely disappointed by this experience."
"1185","Instead of giving obsolete guidance for new employees and trying to change them talk to them. Maybe you can learn something useful from people who used to be your clients.  Please stop bullying your team members and encourage them to bully others. This treatment could seriously damage their health.

Additionally, the specific manager/team you have matters majorly, so seeing (in an interview/phone call) if you could speak with your prospective manager to determine a proper fit. 
The work can get dull and repetitive quickly, and they don't push building marketable skill sets as much as other... companies I have worked at, so this leads to a higher turnover rate, particularly in younger workers. 
Many of the programming languages used here are specific to FactSet as well, so that builds individuals kind of into a hole the longer they stay."

There are career paths to pursue within the company, but FactSet still has the heritage of ""consultants going to sales"" and that's it. To be fair, the management is aware of this and there is genuine motion to change things.

Part of your role is... also to build or heal relationships with your clients - and depending on the account there are plenty of them. Occasionally with your efforts to connect with clients you will feel as if you are trying to draw blood out of a stone. Having that said, consultants perform a wide variety of tasks and two days are seldom alike, thus it's also easy to lose focus on what's important.

I don't think communication is strong within the company; teams in my opinion are very siloed and sometimes I wish that division of labour and assignments could be better. Fair to say, any company would benefit from more efficient resource management."
"1215","Provide more incentives for consultants / clarify responsibilities - there often is a conflict of interest between sales and consultants on daily tasks."
"1216","The performance review system is too simplistic.  Consequently, many employees that slightly exceed their managers' expectations end up with the same raises as employees who either meet or fall a bit short of those expectations.  FactSet gives good raises to significant out-performers, but only if they work in departments that contribute significantly to the firm's bottom line.

Also, at least in my department,... you need to get several promotions before you're eligible for a bonus."
"1217","Add more nuance to the performance ratings."
"1218","-- Exceeding goals is not financially rewarded - Compensation is based on stack ranking, and they force stack ranking to be uniform across teams. Therefore, compensation ends up uniform across teams, even when certain teams heavily outperform others.
-- Boring projects on old technology (if you work on the wrong team)
-- Significant effort underway to move engineering overseas - don't get in now.
-- They tend to... promote based on tenure, not fitness for management or vision for the company. So middle managers tend to get in the way and make bad choices
-- Every year the raises get smaller, and fewer people get bonuses & equity. New CEO has prioritized hiring more C-level execs and spending more on marketing."
"1219","-- End the use of stack ranking immediately - everyone else in the industry has recognized it as a terrible practice.
-- Award compensation to teams and individuals based on the value of the goals they have achieved.

"1220","Severely underpaid!! We are underpaid not only when compared to our main competitors but also when compared to smaller actors in the industry. We are also underpaid when compared within our own organisation to consultants in the US. 

Ambitious/ talented people don't stay. They move to better paying jobs after 2-3 years.

"1684","I was hired from industry as automation engineer to be part of the QA of the main product of factset.
My journey so far has been full of surprises and disbeliefs about the things that happen in this team
Automation they have implemented is a disaster. Joke is a very small word to use in order to describe it.

Technically incapable and incompetent people are put in place as automation leads. They do not let... people from industry do anything to improve automation, nor they have the capability to do it on their own. They are more worried about job security hence do not let new people with outside experience change things to improve and overshadow them.

About people management aspect, there is absolutely no process or professional approach. There are certain individuals who are at team leader level in QA Analyst teams. They do not have minimum communication skills, product knowledge, QA knowledge and management skills. They have established strong ties with associate directors and senior directors/SVPs from US office in this QA team and influence them. They consistently do not follow of process and professionalism.

People in local QA manager position in this team are hired from outside, and come with strong testing and automation background. But the team leaders bypass the managers to go to Associate Directors and Senior Directors/SVPs in US office, for all matters. The Associate Directors and Senior Director/SVPs are intentionally entertaining these team leaders.

Senior director level people in my SBU QA team are very good as people, but are underskilleed. They spent a decade in the company to build good relations with top management and grown to senior director/SVP level. They do not have QA skills, management skills, and lack automation and computer science background. Because of the lack of skillset, they are being regularly fooled by few individuals in the team"
"1685","Have some professionalism and process in place. Right not the system is disorganized and messed up. Team leaders bypass QA manger and go to associate directors and senior directors/senior VPs to get their stuff done. The associate directors and senior directors are encouraging that approach.
Based the work that is done, to be very honest, you cannot even call this a Software QA team. 90% of the management (senior... director, associate director and team leaders) is scrap. 
It is highly recommended to get some people with strong quality engineering background in the top positions of this team.

There is so much of scam going on in upper management and the HR... teams. There are heads who support these things and they are least bothered about good people leaving the company. People at VP levels have zero technical knowledge and make unnecessary changes to the process and workflows. If any one questions those workflows, upper management takes out the grudge during their performance review and they are being rated very bad for silly reasons.People at  VP level keep track of break timings as well and take strict actions against employee as well as respective team leader. QA process in the main SBU is a total crap. Upper management can't tolerate if people at associate level go and directly talk to development team. That's the reason they forcibly created some coordinators in middle so people don't directly talk to offshore engineers. Anything they have to say, they need to talk through coordinator. People hired at coordinator level do not even understand the process and workflows in spite of having good experience and they are also just mediators and work like labors for the people at upper level. If anyone speaks up about any challenges or concerns, that's it; they will be out of company.

"1877","Can only speak to GSCS (Sales, Specialty, and Consulting), but FactSet is in many ways analogous to a Ponzi scheme. At a basic level, our client facing model is to bring in 2+ new hires for every lost employee of tenure to ultimately keep costs down and expectations even lower. The company does not care about the client experience, nor are they ultimately concerned with their success as we time and again drive good... people away to essentially subsidize our competition or our clients with relatively seasoned junior talent.

Phils stated goals of being a world class risk provider, open platform, etc. are all fantastic but he simply doesnt have the middle management or tenured contributors with the drive to see these policies through to completion. Too many senior managers are scared of him (he fires people) or complacent because they have families to provide for and they dont want to rock the boat. In a way, I get it. But it really doesnt help the company (top line, margins, stock price) or inspire people to stick around and fight the good fight. GSCS lost a huge percentage of employees last year because of comp or people simply not being bought into leadership on the ground. Phil can have all the town halls he wants, but until people start feeling invested in and hungry to innovate and try new things The Street and our shareholders will continue to be agnostic to unimpressed with our performance.

I know Phil reads these periodically and hates the phrase, but FactSet remains a good company to start your career when you have no better alternative. Your early years are vitally important in setting up a prosperous career later  dont waste away more time than required in finding a better company or opportunities for your late 20s, 30s, and beyond.

1. Immigration process too worse compared to any other company - They wont start literally anything without you pushing on them. Also even if they started there is no way to track progress other than contacting the people involved. Forget about starting green card process. If you have someone on H4 then it will be a night mare to stay here. One of the reason its worse it there is only one person who... does all the things right from start till the end.
2. Management does not care too much about you if you have any immigration issues because they themselves don't know whats happening and what to do. Even if you tell them they wont care much.
3. Compensation is pretty low compared to other companies

Advice - Start with FactSet, stay for a year or so and then join a better one if you are an immigrant."
"1946","Take into account why people are leaving and work on those reasons"
"1947","Had been working there for around 1 year in 2015-2016 as a ""financial analyst"".
Absolutely the worst job I have ever had and the worst company I've ever seen. Absolute majority of the management is unqualified, the company is extremely cheap, paying low wages to empoyees, while trying to pretend to be nice by giving employees insultingly cheap ""gifts"" like small packs of the cheapest you can find juice or unhealthy... and pretty much uneatable by normal people food.
But the most important part and the reason why I want to leave the review, is the office. The company doesn't care about it's employees health. It's a typical closed office space with a lot of aircons. The aircons are not maintained right, no one cleans them ever (to cut cost, which seems like an obvious reason). This effects employees who get sick very often due to the constantly weakened immunity system. This is a well-known problem not just among the Factset employees, but also among employees of other corporations (I'm guessing they are also cheap and treating employees as an expandable material) occupying other floors of the building. It is very easy to see how a job in Factset ruins people's health, relatively slowly but steadily.
Advicing everyone NOT to consider a job in this company.
P.S.: oh yeah, forgot to mention - Factset promotes itself as a reputable American company. Do not be fooled. The Manila subdivisiin is managed primarily by Facset's Indian subsidiary. So expect indian ""high standards"" in everything."
"1948","1.  Appraisal system is very opaque. Goals setting are optional and ratings depends on whims and fancies of manager.

The management should listen to new ideas and understand the new ways of working. Some are really open to changes that can benefit the organization.
The way they evaluate people can be improved as this is only based on numbers and results the behaviour must be incorporated here as well, yes there is a subjectivity... part but I think there are items that can be added like if the employee has projects, initiatives, if they joined company activities, etc. The goals that they have must be aligned with the goals of the managers as well- What's the rationale? While the team members are achieving their targets the leaders are achieving theirs too at the same time.
They should look at the extended breaks happening in different teams, this unproductive time can be used by helping out other teams, or doing projects. The team leaders I think some of them are just letting this slide but if you compute it thousands are being lost in the process.

"2006","Having moved into another SaaS company, I have seen some light in regards to problems FactSet had. First and foremost - the pay. I know it's always easy to complain about pay, but FactSet's pay is well under what you could make elsewhere. In sales, specifically, there is zero commission. No commission and no real ties to performance (outside of a lofty 6 month review), does not incentivize the sales organization... correctly. This will continue to drive people out if they don't fix this. Autonomy regarding freedom to work from home is also not really there either - which is just not standard anymore (for anyone that is in sales, especially, past 5 years experience). Lastly, internal politics. Luckily, I found myself on the right side of this line in my career at FactSet, however, I saw several people treated a tad unfairly (in their career progression and performance reviews) due to their lack of being in the optimal standing with the popular and influential group of people. All this being said, FactSet is full of wonderful people. It really is a great way to kick off your career and get some great, transferable experience."

Lastly, I understand you can't force teams to adopt new technology and standards, but if you're going to have a standards review team (which you do) and officially... endorse those chosen standards, you should at least check in every few years to make sure there aren't teams that have not updated in literally 10 years."
