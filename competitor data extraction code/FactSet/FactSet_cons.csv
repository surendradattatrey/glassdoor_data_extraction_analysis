"110","Salary, Benefits and Leaves:
If you aim to boost more your salary, you may want to consider looking for another job after 2-3 years of stay in FactSet as a software engineer. Although there are a lot of senior software engineers who stayed for more than 5 years (some even part of the pioneer batch who work for FactSet with almost 10 years). Yes, leaves might be overflowing with FactSet but it also goes in the... saying that it comes with how you manage your deliverables. Some offsets and leaves are left unused due to the number of deliverables which for me is a downside because it's your time who got lost in the overall process.

Career Risks:
While other teams offer a wide range of tech stack, some teams are working 99% of the time with in house tools which will make your programming skills stale. There is also a culture within these teams that as long as it can be implemented using the in house tools, it shall be done that way. Some even forcibly make it work even if code maintainability and quality is already at stake. Plus, you are really not programming with their in house tools but rather creating driver files for them.

Management:
Most of the times, managers forgot that engineers/reports are not just numbers in the charts. There are several concerns raised but neglected by the management. The management also do not listen to their subordinates emphatically and try to understand where they are coming from."

Loyalists, in turn, push short-term, attention-grabbing projects of little lasting value and are promoted. This value placed on short-term change creates an incentive to restructure constantly, which is disruptive to the front-line employees who... actually do the work. This has degraded the company's previous strength in work-life balance. At the same time, leadership is unwilling to get rid of highly paid free loaders who don't contribute to company needs."

The management should listen to new ideas and understand the new ways of working. Some are really open to changes that can benefit the organization.
The way they evaluate people can be improved as this is only based on numbers and results the behaviour must be incorporated here as well, yes there is a subjectivity... part but I think there are items that can be added like if the employee has projects, initiatives, if they joined company activities, etc. The goals that they have must be aligned with the goals of the managers as well- What's the rationale? While the team members are achieving their targets the leaders are achieving theirs too at the same time.
They should look at the extended breaks happening in different teams, this unproductive time can be used by helping out other teams, or doing projects. The team leaders I think some of them are just letting this slide but if you compute it thousands are being lost in the process. 
I hate to say this but this is a group of undisciplined individuals who can just easily get away with things violating the code of conduct which they have created within."

1. Immigration process too worse compared to any other company - They wont start literally anything without you pushing on them. Also even if they started there is no way to track progress other than contacting the people involved. Forget about starting green card process. If you have someone on H4 then it will be a night mare to stay here. One of the reason its worse it there is only one person who... does all the things right from start till the end.
2. Management does not care too much about you if you have any immigration issues because they themselves don't know whats happening and what to do. Even if you tell them they wont care much.

"127","Had been working there for around 1 year in 2015-2016 as a ""financial analyst"".
Absolutely the worst job I have ever had and the worst company I've ever seen. Absolute majority of the management is unqualified, the company is extremely cheap, paying low wages to empoyees, while trying to pretend to be nice by giving employees insultingly cheap ""gifts"" like small packs of the cheapest you can find juice or unhealthy... and pretty much uneatable by normal people food.
But the most important part and the reason why I want to leave the review, is the office. The company doesn't care about it's employees health. It's a typical closed office space with a lot of aircons. The aircons are not maintained right, no one cleans them ever (to cut cost, which seems like an obvious reason). This effects employees who get sick very often due to the constantly weakened immunity system. This is a well-known problem not just among the Factset employees, but also among employees of other corporations (I'm guessing they are also cheap and treating employees as an expandable material) occupying other floors of the building. It is very easy to see how a job in Factset ruins people's health, relatively slowly but steadily.
Advicing everyone NOT to consider a job in this company.
P.S.: oh yeah, forgot to mention - Factset promotes itself as a reputable American company. Do not be fooled. The Manila subdivisiin is managed primarily by Facset's Indian subsidiary. So expect indian ""high standards"" in everything."

There is so much of scam going on in upper management and the HR... teams. There are heads who support these things and they are least bothered about good people leaving the company. People at VP levels have zero technical knowledge and make unnecessary changes to the process and workflows. If any one questions those workflows, upper management takes out the grudge during their performance review and they are being rated very bad for silly reasons.People at  VP level keep track of break timings as well and take strict actions against employee as well as respective team leader. QA process in the main SBU is a total crap. Upper management can't tolerate if people at associate level go and directly talk to development team. That's the reason they forcibly created some coordinators in middle so people don't directly talk to offshore engineers. Anything they have to say, they need to talk through coordinator. People hired at coordinator level do not even understand the process and workflows in spite of having good experience and they are also just mediators and work like labors for the people at upper level. If anyone speaks up about any challenges or concerns, that's it; they will be out of company.

"277","I was hired from industry as automation engineer to be part of the QA of the main product of factset.
My journey so far has been full of surprises and disbeliefs about the things that happen in this team
Automation they have implemented is a disaster. Joke is a very small word to use in order to describe it.

Technically incapable and incompetent people are put in place as automation leads. They do not let... people from industry do anything to improve automation, nor they have the capability to do it on their own. They are more worried about job security hence do not let new people with outside experience change things to improve and overshadow them.

About people management aspect, there is absolutely no process or professional approach. There are certain individuals who are at team leader level in QA Analyst teams. They do not have minimum communication skills, product knowledge, QA knowledge and management skills. They have established strong ties with associate directors and senior directors/SVPs from US office in this QA team and influence them. They consistently do not follow of process and professionalism.

People in local QA manager position in this team are hired from outside, and come with strong testing and automation background. But the team leaders bypass the managers to go to Associate Directors and Senior Directors/SVPs in US office, for all matters. The Associate Directors and Senior Director/SVPs are intentionally entertaining these team leaders.

Senior director level people in my SBU QA team are very good as people, but are underskilleed. They spent a decade in the company to build good relations with top management and grown to senior director/SVP level. They do not have QA skills, management skills, and lack automation and computer science background. Because of the lack of skillset, they are being regularly fooled by few individuals in the team"

Also I feel that senior management is wasting a lot of money trying to bring in upper management talent and are not really giving enough yearly raises to the engineers and other employees. Also money is being wasted hosting... presentation events in expensive places (That are not even in the US). The previous CEO Phil Hadley would have events that all of the employees could see directly from his desk wearing casual clothing. This costs nothing. There is no reason spending $30,000 on an event in Germany when all of the engineers could see senior management for free directly from a room at HQ."

"344","I updated my review because I wanted to express my disagreement with the recent decision not to find a new CTO. Instead of a CTO they will have something like a Chief Product and Technology officer. Don't get me wrong, the product developers need a seat at the C-level. But even with the new SBU structure, there needs to be a single person who is responsible ONLY for engineering. 

I think this could end up being a... very bad decision, because without central leadership engineering is at risk of stagnating/fracturing, especially since the engineers will also be divided into different strategic business units now. This also comes at a bad time, because solving stability issues will require strong leadership.

Other cons:
-  Engineering is seriously lacking in internal documentation
- There is some risk you could have a mediocre manager, though you can apply internally to change teams after 1.5 years or so
- Less cutting edge work than Google or Facebook, but closer to the cutting edge than most other companies and improving consistently
- Less support for H1B workers than some other companies (specifically I think they don't sponsor you the first year if you will have been with the company less than 6 months). Ask the recruiter for details on what to expect."
"345","- Raises are poor, and our stock price was used as a justification for them being low.  (no mention of revenue or profits, which have been stable or climbing) No performance bonuses for younger employees (maybe it's different for more senior personnel, but I'm not sure), so don't bother working hard here, you won't be rewarded. On call is not compensated.

- Managers pay extensive lip service to quality... engineering, that is not backed up with action. You'll in-fact be penalised if you're focusing on quality engineering over just shipping features, even if they're dangerous/flakey/poorly implemented.

- ""Developer Services"" is a division of the company responsible for maintaining infrastructure and tech for developers. They're awful obstructions to your job.  The test system is flakey (not counting the actual tests themselves), build system is slow and often incorrect, and there was no supported way to generate documentation using tools by senior engineers; you had to do it manually, and they didn't care. Your life as a developer is going to be made worse as a result of this division.

- Low motivation due to outsourcing, low engineering standards. Senior management lies about out sourcing (we were ""expanding"" into the Philippines and India), but many of the teams I depended on for databases/infrastructure were entirely in the Philippines. No documentation/brittle tests and no desire to change this.

- Most hires are new college grads. Many of these are non-native english speakers who form cliques around their native languages. As someone who only spoke English, I sometimes felt isolated or like I was walking into a different country.

- Satellite offices leave you feeling out of the decision making processes.

- Terrible managers, who do little to support you in your job, and your growth as an engineer."

"436","The support role isn't very glamorous, and it is quite inconsistent (both good and bad). One day you could be telling someone how to shut off the mobile app and another day you could be building out entire performance reports for a whole firm. After few years of consulting, the bad starts to outweigh the good, but you have to go out and fetch your new job internally. 

Transition times between consulting and other... jobs take too long, which means in addition to the forced 2.5 yrs in consulting, you can tack on another 3 months of transition time before you can stop answering your previous clients.

"439","Do not offer career development, growth or paths. Do not have performance discussions or periodic check ins. For those that have been working at FactSet for 15 + years they treat us well and will do more for ""us"" than the new group. They are resistant to change even though they claim to want it. They are the most unorganized, dysfunctional place I have ever worked. They do not believe in retaining talent, they would... rather protect a manager that has been there for a long time than protect the employees that actually produce and know what they are doing.

The Management is... comprised of 2 or 3 people (with one leading by just shouting). His vision of the company is more important than the Mission Statement of the company itself. With his outstanding methods of evaluation, the essence of research has been washed away. No one comes to work with a commitment, they come to work and leave. You have no idea of how you will be evaluated and you don't even know if you will get a reward or a PIP. 
Everyone is rated on a common sheet which has no logic. No one knows what operations is but everyone uses the term wherever needed. A lead need not know what his team does, he needs to know operations (God know operations of what). You will be evaluated based on your desperation at work and not output.

FactSet prefers to recruit graduates (at least in the engineering side) which is good in some cases but this is leaving FactSet behind in terms of gaining fresh perspectives and best practices. During my 3 year tenure at FactSet, the graduate to... experienced hire ratio is something like 20:1 (or even worse). People usually get promoted based on how long they are in the company.

"554","Depending on the team your work can be rather monotonous after learning the ropes and your core tasks don't necessarily challenge or enable you to grow as a professional. There are career paths to pursue within the company, but FactSet still has the heritage of ""consultants going to sales"" and that's it. To be fair, the management is aware of this and there is genuine motion to change things.

Part of your role is... also to build or heal relationships with your clients - and depending on the account there are plenty of them. Occasionally with your efforts to connect with clients you will feel as if you are trying to draw blood out of a stone. Having that said, consultants perform a wide variety of tasks and two days are seldom alike, thus it's also easy to lose focus on what's important.

I don't think communication is strong within the company; teams in my opinion are very siloed and sometimes I wish that division of labour and assignments could be better. Fair to say, any company would benefit from more efficient resource management."
"555","The performance review system is too simplistic.  Consequently, many employees that slightly exceed their managers' expectations end up with the same raises as employees who either meet or fall a bit short of those expectations.  FactSet gives good raises to significant out-performers, but only if they work in departments that contribute significantly to the firm's bottom line.

Also, at least in my department,... you need to get several promotions before you're eligible for a bonus."
"556","-- Exceeding goals is not financially rewarded - Compensation is based on stack ranking, and they force stack ranking to be uniform across teams. Therefore, compensation ends up uniform across teams, even when certain teams heavily outperform others.
-- Boring projects on old technology (if you work on the wrong team)
-- Significant effort underway to move engineering overseas - don't get in now.
-- They tend to... promote based on tenure, not fitness for management or vision for the company. So middle managers tend to get in the way and make bad choices
-- Every year the raises get smaller, and fewer people get bonuses & equity. New CEO has prioritized hiring more C-level execs and spending more on marketing."

They are promoting diversification and kind of 'welcoming' people with the industry experience but behave with them in a very strange manner. They treat people with 10-20 years of experience as children. Extremely bullying and stressful atmosphere for new entries. They are looking for robots, not for... individuals. I was extremely disappointed by this experience."
"570","Need to train the middle managers"
"571","They aren't very flexible about position relocation within the company. It is possible, but isn't common/encouraged.  
Additionally, the specific manager/team you have matters majorly, so seeing (in an interview/phone call) if you could speak with your prospective manager to determine a proper fit. 
The work can get dull and repetitive quickly, and they don't push building marketable skill sets as much as other... companies I have worked at, so this leads to a higher turnover rate, particularly in younger workers. 
Many of the programming languages used here are specific to FactSet as well, so that builds individuals kind of into a hole the longer they stay."

"588","Know what you're getting into--this is NOT a finance job no matter how they spin it, it's a tech support job that revolves around financial data.  When I was working it was phones support all the time.  My friend who still works there says that they now have instant messaging.  You'll be on phones or instant messaging minimum 5, sometimes 8 hours a day for your first few months.  If you get a call you're expected to... figure out the solution on the fly.  If you can't you'll have to get back to the client, and then go on ready for another call.  As you might guess your workload just piles up more and more unless you figure out a system on your own to stop that.  There's a app that monitor's everybody's time on phones, how many calls they took and other stats.  You'll feel like you're being micromanaged--because it's true.  If you are stressed out easily, DON'T apply here.

Once you move onto accounts and have your own clients, don't expect the workload to get any easier.  There can easily be 300+ clients that you're responsible for supporting.  If they have a question on how to build a formula or format a graph, the burden is on you to get it done.

For 90% of the time your clients are the ones who are doing the analysis, and you are the tool they'll be using to get that analysis done.  Many times you will feel like you are being used by your clients.  It doesn't come as a surprise that during my first few months working there 4 or 5 of my collegues who were hired around the same time as me left to pursue better opportunities.  I should have left earlier, as I was looking for a true finance related job.

For the first year you'll be working--a lot.  They may say during the interview that there's a great work life balance, but more often than not meetings/reviews/online classes will be scheduled during your lunch hour.  Lunch ""hour"" is more like Like ""half-hour"" as 4 out of 5 times you'll still be on phones.  If you get a call at 12:29 it's your duty to stay on until that call is done; if that call ends at 1:00, well, you're lunchtime just got cut 30 minutes.

I was easily working over 60 hours when I started, and I know some of my colleagues who were working even more, especially when their client requests piled up.

As many other reviewers said, there is little room for advancement if you don't want to go into sales down the road or product development.

Year-over-year compensation... increases are often laughable, and internal promotions lead to insulting bumps in pay. Well-qualified and Senior engineers who do not come directly from college or from an external company are paid FAR below company averages.

I worked there for 2.5 years because I got used to doing nothing. The company just wants cheap mediocre engineers to keep things going on. Many people stick to the company because of their personal gain and have no professional interest within FactSet. Poor coding practises and legacy code is all over the place. Too much of internal politics to push back work. All managers try to please each other instead of focusing the real work done. There are always some re org changes going on.

"705","NOT a finance job! Do not believe how they sell it, this is a consulting job for software, not finance. Expect to know/learn how to code in the software. Decent first job salary but low for any expienced hire. Very poor management! Majority of managers started when company was young and are only in their positions due to seniority. Very little actual management experience and it shows. Very little room for... advancement as promotions are based on seniority rather than performance.

Consequently FactSet focus almost exclusively on... hiring new college graduates who don't have the political experience to navigate the tricky Stack Ranking process properly, and don't teach or warn them upon hire.

"713","Management can exhibit strong nepotism in their promotion decisions."
"714","* Huge inconsistency in how various teams and departments are run, so the overall quality of one's general work experience can be hugely dependent on the luck of the draw when one is assigned to a team (such as when initially applying and being hired).
* Engineers are generally kept very much separated and isolated from other departments, especially the sales side, so required interactions (to respond to client... issues and the like) can sometimes be somewhat tense and unpleasant due to the general social psychological principle of communication with an ""Unfamiliar Them"" often being more difficult and more prone to misunderstandings and latent subconscious attitudes about dealing with another group that one perceives is treated wildly differently from oneself.
* A very outdated codebase that as an Engineer, one will frequently have to dig through to implement a requested change or bug fix, including, but not limited to, code written for an OS that is technically obsolete, with much of the current Engineering work being part of a multi-year effort to completely remove the reliance on this obsolete OS by re-writing code to be compatible with Linux.
* Company-wide move to converting all office space to open-floor plans leading to increasingly noisy and distracting workplace.
* Engineering advancement seems to largely fizzle out after one makes Senior Software Engineers, with a combination of hard work, managerial/people skills, and luck required to be offered any real expansion in role or responsibilities beyond that point."

"735","management is friendly, I can not remember any"
"736","Low pay. Not marketable skills as the tools are mostly inhouse."
"737","They mostly hire people straight out of college and train them the way they want them. Consequently, as an experienced engineer, I didn't have much opportunity to work on new things. I got stuck in a boring group working on boring libraries. I asked to be transferred several times to no avail. Since most of the people don't have much industry experience, they make some stupid design decisions. Everything has the... ""must be built here"" syndrome, including the web servers that run the new application infrastructure. That's just asking for security issues. The pay is not quite competitive for experienced engineers."
"738","The interview process was a giant lie, they go on about how you will have a great work/ life balance and only work from 8:30-5:30. In reality you are working at the office until 7pm or later most days. On top of this you also have projects and client work you have to take home and work on in your free time and weekends. They constantly schedule meetings during your lunch hour, which you don't get anyway because you... have so much work you are expected to always work through it. 

The job role itself is a glorified call center agent with you often feeling you are chained to the desk. (This is not a finance role, no matter what they tell you.)They scare you to make you feel like you can not go on ""not ready"" making you feel like you can barely nip out to go to the bathroom. This only gets worse after Accounts Academy, you will now have 8 hours of phones a day plus clients. Every minute of your day is taken trying to juggle clients requests, phones, schedule client meetings, then manage trading your phones so you can go to these meetings.

Management is terrible, they lack communication and management skills. They promote in FactSet for how long you have been with the company not with what skills you bring to the table. Meetings with your manager can be painful and they take every opportunity to criticize your work.

If you want to work in Finance go somewhere else, no one knows what FactSet is, this job has very few transferable skills to help you get a job elsewhere. After being a consultant for 2 years you only have two career options in the company; move into Sales or Product Development. Most people are looking for other positions well before this. Most consultants I spoke with have one foot out the door after Accounts Academy, this is when they all realize the job, stress, and workload are not worth it.

"743","maximum people get the salary will low at starting but it will increase in future its depend up on the people stability & hard work."
"744","Though you are given the title of consultant, this job can feel more like glorified IT support. Though you are given a lot of exposure to the finance industry, you are only involved with a very small part. Though the starting salary is very high and you are reviewed every 6 months, there are no pay jumps if you end up receiving a promotion. If you are ambitious, you better be interested in a career in sales. If not,... this job can feel like a dead end."
"745","Take what they tell you during the interview process with a grain of salt. They sell the position as more of a role involved with the Account teams and Sales process when really you are a glorified help desk/call center employee with double the work. Client's calling in to Support desk are often rude, arrogant, and unappreciative of the great work done by the consultants here. It can get very stressful and... aggravating handling 15-20 calls a day in which you are doing a lot of the work for your clients or answering mind numbingly easy questions. 

Management does little to inspire and motivate workers and will take any opportunity they can to criticize your work. Reactive is the best word to describe your day to day tasks as issues come up and clients call with problems. If you do not handle stress well DO NOT take this job. 

Promotion is done by how much time you've worked there not the quality of your work.  If on paper you do not meet the length of time required fill position, you will not have a shot at moving up regardless of qualities. Mobility is very rigid and turnover is relatively high."

"751","I must mention first that what happens with you in a company is much more strongly tied to the team you work with rather than the entire company especially if the company is very big. 

1) The engineers don't have a lot of say. Things run the way they already are. Less innovation. More support work. Less development work. 

2) Things move really slow. Months are spent in discussing the specs. 

3) Very few... people from Computer Science Background and those who understand the difference between doing things and doing them optimally. ""Get the work done fast and asap"" is the cry. 

4) No ""Code Reviews"". Less focus on Unit Testing.

"802","Pay: After realisation of the competitiveness in other companies, I realised pay here is definitely not matching software companies in London. As years went by, I realised that people in other companies were receiving bonuses and also larger pay rises which made me sceptical of the salaries here for Software Engineers. Alongside that fact, in company wide meetings we were all told that Sales would receive a... ""Chairman's Club"", which meant they would have luxurious settings in Europe, US etc for meetings when they met their targets - meaning Software Engineers were angered and frustrated by this.

People: Regarding the management, it seems managers are not assessed, they are given the role of manager when they have been here for some time rather than actually accessing their skills. I think a real interview process is necessary when deciding who should become a manager - not word of mouth or ""You have been here some time and proven you're a good Software Engineer"", leading code and people are two different things.

Environment: The company promotes a start-up culture but that is beginning to fade as policies are being put in place that is beginning to remove this kind of culture. 

Technologies: As a Software Engineer that had been in the company for many years, newer, transitional, technologies are now being brought into the company which I do not have much experience with - meaning when looking for new career choices in Software Engineering they are limited due to the older legacy technologies where most of the time was spent when coding. 

Career: Motivation is key, unless you are self-motivated, work can become mundane. At times exciting projects arise but if you demonstrate that you are a trustworthy employee, the company will rely on you to do tasks that are irrelevant to your personal goals and achievements you wish to reach."

- There is some resentment of software engineers by the non-engineers at the company (who make up most... of FactSet's workforce).

Although now... things appear to be stabilized.

At the time I was there, there was not a clearly defined career path for most positions.  They did not have even any titles that could be given as a sign of progress or promotion.  This was a problem for many employees."

"845","-monotonous job and very limited growth in terms of skills

-no training or learning opportunity outside the country

-I hate that they changed their sick and vacation leave scheme. It's a bit inconsiderate to have a medical certificate for one day sick leave. It is not every time that we need to go to the doctor just to have us check for something that can be treated obviously with proper rest... and paracetamol. It is very stressful for an unwell person to go to the hospital/clinic and to wait uncomfortably for his/her turn in the doctor's office just to secure a medical certificate. I was even reprimanded by a doctor one time when I went to him in a sickly state just to secure a med cert. In the end all I got was an advice to get plenty of rest, water, and some paracetamol. Now just imagine the inconvenience it made. I just hope that someone would end the stupidity of requiring a medical certificate for one day sick leave.

"847","compensation level is below par industry standards"
"848","Vacation days are not rolled over, some managers are more lenient, but it depends who you get.
No initial training for product developers or for internal job switchers and expected to learn via RPDs. Consultants are help-desk and many PDs do QA instead of getting to do more interesting aspects of the job so their skills are not maximized.
Many roles are being off-shored

Employees promoted based on time with the... company so that many managers do not have any management skills and do not know how to work as managers overseeing a team. The company tries to give them training, but managers behave the same after the training. Managers do not motivate staff and do not help them grow by giving them added responsibilities.

Many employees are moved around since the company has a lot of restructuring. This increases the likelihood of employees leaving or of HR pushing them out due to not enjoying their new roles, teams or managers. For example, some people with 6 years at the company may have 6 different managers in that time. Terrible managers stay with the company even with bad reviews because of the time they have put in while good employees get pushed out if the manager does not like them. 

Advancement is limited particularly around 3-5 years with the company.

Tuition reimbursement is a lie. Some teams can use it and others cannot but their isn't any clarity about the rules to request the funds or who can get it. Apparently their is a sort of wait-list, but it isn't posted so no one knows who is on it or not allowing for preferential treatment of certain employees to get it. In addition to the ""list"", your manager also has to approve the course as being directly related to your role, which some managers may not do even when your role requires the information from a job related course. The company prefers that employees work on the CFA although it can be less related to our job then a particular course."

"898","As with any software company, we are often asked to fulfill certain tasks without being given the proper bandwidth and time to complete them at an acceptable level. For instance, while it's nice for developers to be able to take their computers home, the fact is that the laptops given to developers often strain at having developer environments for multiple languages, the compiled versions of our product, Outlook,... and two instances of Excel open at once (this is not an unusual combination of programs that need to be open at a given time). Also, there is often a tendency to break away from the stated op plan and go chasing after relatively minor accomplishments.

"901","FactSet has made some business decisions over the years that have put it in the position of needing to hire more engineers than it can.
- What FactSet was doing 20 years ago was state-of-the-art. The environment that we operate in today is archaic. Engineers have to put a lot of effort in to simply maintain what we have. They also will not typically get experience in what is the industry standard.
- We can't... simply switch to what is state-of-the-art today because FactSet's clients do not like change. Over the years, bugs have become features. It is extremely difficult to make major infrastructure improvements, even if that means we fix bugs in the meantime.

Work-life balance is good, but more can be done to improve it.
- Many engineers have on-call responsibilities. Senior management and people in other departments do not appreciate how difficult it can be to work all night and then have to work all day.
- Having been at FactSet many years, I have seen perks diminish and go away entirely. I suppose these are natural growing pains, but I wanted to list these things anyway.
  - Home internet reimbursement for people with on-call responsibilities.
  - The ability to invite a date / spouse to the holiday party.
  - A summer picnic.
  - Lunch on Fridays.
  - The lunch subsidy is not increased for inflation.
  - Tuition reimbursement. (Used to be 100%. It went away entirely, then came back capped at what FactSet can deduct.)

There is no system to support people who are helping others or develop a new hire. Sadly, there are too many level organization hierarchy and many try too hard to bubble up the chain. Those who plays their games will be noticed but not those who... focus too much on their works. As a result, many people learned to do just enough work to keep their jobs.

I figured I'd join the rest of the crowd who complain about salaries at FactSet....

On another note, I noticed employees who come through acquisitions are under qualified for the positions that were handed to them on a silver platter.  It's absurd to me how little some of those people know about FactSet.  There should be a yearly quiz on how to write a simple =FDS code.

- The recent hiring blitz has introduced some less than qualified engineers... into our talent pool.

"1025","Management  (at least in my office) was very strange-- Catty, gossipy, and not very confident.  In fact, there were too many managers and it was not really very clear to most what each did. I know this sounds common, but the office went through many changes that were never really explained and  most were afraid to voice concerns out of fear of retaliation. The office was a place were smart, hard-working consultants... were not rewarded and sub-par consultants who did not rock the boat were quickly elevated. This resulted in many of the smartest people leaving for greener pastures. In fact, my office alone saw huge levels of defection to clients and other companies. Most left to either (1) make LOTS more money ( myself included) or (2) go somewhere where they felt appreciated  and intellectually challenged."
"1026","May get stuck with a boring project"
"1027","After consulting, you have opportunity to move on to another department or into management, but if the options don't suit you, you hit a dead end as you very quickly realize you are ""outgrowing"" consulting.
Also, the structure of management in consulting is such that managers aren't directly involved in the accounts you, as a consultant, work on.  So they know little to nothing of the accounts beyond what you tell... them.  It is hard for them to understand the difficulties to face and try to help."
"1028","Dictator rule at Hyderabad

"1029","Rigid promotion requirements hinder top performers from faster recognition (for some teams, not all), pay is average to below average for the financial software industry in NYC, in-house technology-oriented training not at the level of managerial training, an initiative needs to be developed to help PDs and engineers collaborate better (I'm serious about this), working in the financial software domain means you... don't really understand the end-user (unless you are a banker or money manager), some teams have pager / on call duties, specialization means cross-team moves are less likely."

- Employees promoted into management rather haphazardly and arbitrarily. The company tries to... solve this rather fruitlessly with management training.
- Many dead-end hiring positions setup arbitrarily without a care for how an employee can develop in that position. New hires: although there are some amazing opportunities at FactSet, be very weary of which position you interview for.
- Few non-managerial training options for software engineers."

If you don't like open offices that foster communication between teams and team members, then you can always put on some headphones and listen to some tunes."
"1036","Pay is not as good as the banks (although it is close), this is a software company, if you want to work all hours of the day and be rewarded with a huge pay cheque then go to a bank. FactSet makes up for this by being focussed on engineering and encouraging a good work / life balance.

The company can be a little slow in identifying poor performers and acting on this, which can seem unfair if you are doing very... well."
"1037","Very few are motivated to do the right development thing"
"1038","Compensation is also a con, because it could be much higher.  It's important to keep in mind though that Factset doesn't ask too much of their engineers so paying them top dollar would be silly.  There's a lot of turnover in upper managment in the software department and it feels like most people view Factset as a stepping stone instead of a career."

"1048","The promotion system is a mystery.  At times it seems someone reaches into a bag and draws a name to decide who gets promoted.  Some Consultants move up after a year, whereas some have been Consultants for more than three years.  Seemingly no pattern to this.  Also, a Consultant's skill set surpasses that of management in terms of ability to support clients very quickly.  At that point if you don't have a clear... vision of where your career is going, and make that known, you will be stuck in one place.

It used to be that any smart person with a good attitude and work ethic could find a place for themselves at FactSet;... now it's the people with the aggressive personalities who succeed.

Veteran FactSetters are leaving - including our well-appreciated president - and the word is that they were pushed out, or shall I say conditions were created which made it more comfortable for them to leave than to say.

"1106","There was a large reorganization that caused a massive exodus of employees out of the what you would call the old ""investment banking"" product development and engineering division out of the NYC office.  We have already lost some top notch employees and the trend will continue the next few months.  Many people are receiving much better compensation offers from other companies. Soon, there will be no one left in the... group.  In order for management to stop people from leaving, they will need to start increasing pay for the employees that deserve it.     

Compensation is much higher at Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters so I highly recommend applying there.  Capital IQ, Dealogic, IPreo tend to offer you slightly higher pay then what you're receiving at FactSet since they like to draw away from a competitor."

"1108","If you don't come in through a consulting class it is difficult to 'fit in'. There are a lot of cliques in this company and it sometimes feels like high school."
"1109","Being a new company some adjustments must be implemented during each quarter before one company can fully adapt to its environment. One of the problems in this company is that they already started to maintain everything and settling with what works in the past and expect that the trend and productivity will be the same.  They must first provide concrete structure before making it official and stick with that policy.... The most pressing problem is the location and size of the building. Situated in the heart of Taguig one of the new business centered area in the country but the main problem is the accesability of the area. Factset realizing the problem, provided scheduled shuttle service. But with the growth of the company and changing trends in the country the schedule doesnt seem to adapt to its environment ( the last trip to the company is 5:50 ) in which the main trasportation in the region (MRT) opens at 5:30. And most are resorting to waking as early as 4am just to arrive on time and some are just left with the option to ride a cab just to go to work. ( for entry level employees like me this is a big burden finacially) And with the growth in the number of employees shuttles service are becoming scare and the next shift that starts at 3:30pm are either coming in early or riding a cab to work. The developer of the area ""Megaworld"" already forsaw this problem and offered free shuttle rides around the area and ""peak hours"" scheduled bus rides in and out of the area in which the schedules of the company doesnt fall under. Second is the space. The area of the company if fairly small and with the additions of new employees it is becoming crowded and employees are cramming themselves in the pantry and facilities (lockers are shared and the company has a no bag to workstation policy) they have already started plans to expand its production to other floors. Third problem would be the Management of the company. In regards with the problems and countless suggestions by the employees (which are relayed from the team lead to the management) the response to the queries and recommended solution are kind of slow and employees are the ones who adjusts and suffer. Openess of the Management to suggestions or additional staff can eliminate this problem immediately. Last would be Employee turnover. This company is a good start to those with no experience but to maintain these employees are hard for the company because at one point the compensation are insufficent for one employee and most of the employees are just staying for experience."
"1110","Pay could be higher

"1113","**Phil Hadley is clueless about a number of products. He only knows what he told by others. Most of the upper-mgmt just tell him what he wants to hear, hoping to keep on working till their screw ups get discovered. If he actually visited with the consultants and specialists, he would actually see what needs to be done to grow FactSet.

**It's all about selling. They will hire/promote you as a consultant or... specialist and tell you your job is account management. If you work on a hard product, you will then become the de-facto sales person. The sales generalist won't want to understand your product, so you will be doing cold calls rather than just building and strengthening existing clients/doing demos/trainings/support.. what you were hired for. Say you do get a lead by a cold call. Then you need to bring the generalist who has done very little. If it goes good, they get the credit. If it goes bad, you get the blame. 

**The company isn't good for a resume. If you put JP Morgan or Bloomberg on your resume it's gold. Putting FactSet on your resume doesn't do much.

**Not many promotion opportunities. In consulting you either become a mid-level consulting mgr or a sales person and eventually a sales mgr. Only engineering really has a career path but that is mostly by nicer titles. 

**They will now nickle and dime you. Blackberries are being taken away. Reimbursement for internet when you need to work from home is no longer done. 
To get your graduate class paid for, you need to pass the CFA (3 yr + test). To take the CFA, you need to work there 2 years. So 5 yrs of working there just to get a class paid for."
"1114","Management is comprised chiefly of frat-boy Boy's Club. ""Quiet"" layoffs (er, positions eliminated) are somewhat un-nerving when one day someone just isn't at work anymore. Most of the hiring these days seems to be in third-world countries."
"1115","most positions can be type cast or pigeon holed as company and product specific skills are required

"1116","define more concrete career paths and make a conscious effort to include more women/minorites in upper level positions"
"1117","Management is inexperienced and not creative. Everyone here has always been here and there is a desperate need for NEW IDEAS. People are extremely resistant to any changes and ""outside"" ideas. They say they want them but then are EXTREMELY slow to even consider them let alone implement them.

FactSet preaches about their culture but their culture is a bunch of really smart people that have minimal social skills... and experience. The culture is suffocating! If you aren't an engineer, consultant, or salesperson nobody cares about you. Doors to offices are always closed and its almost like a library in the cube areas. The silence is deafening. 

Breaking through the stubborn stuffy finance culture is a tough task!"
"1118","The cubical culture makes it quite difficult to focus for long periods of time. Whenever you begin to get productive, someone drops by and starts talking."
"1119","Lower than average compensation
Middle and lower management is not always competent
Certain projects and groups are ""boring"""
"1120","The real life at FactSet: Once hired out of college you are a ""consultant"". However for the first 6 months-a year you are on a help desk taking phone calls (till they decide to move this function to India). The next year you are actually a consultant. However you then have a choice. 

If you don't get poached by a client you career path could be ""specialist"". You then get a small bump in pay, still do help... desk/consulting work for a particular product but then have the additional goal of doing sales. They will also stick you with existing accounts. If you are new you are likely to get some account that are about to have canceled. These numbers will count against you raise/bonus time your first year. You will then be told, oh well, we had that too, just sell more to prevent it. However you will need to depend on the sales generalist to sell. If you have a complex product  you are then basically doing the sales job as well. Make a sale and the generalist will take credit. Don't make it, and it was your fault.

Your other career path is ""Account Executive"". Here you are a Jr Sales person working on existing companies rather than new business for a Sales Generalist. Again you will be given accounts in bad shape. Eventually you move to Sales Generalist where you just become another sales person till you have a bad year or two and then slowly pushed out.

The people who get treated decent are the Engineers and Development. The only issue in these roles is that your promotion is a little extra money and a nicer title. Real promotions take a long time and before you realize it you will be middle-aged and replacable by a 20-something year old. After-all for the first few years, you could be more senior, but you will have the same title as them.

The people telling you need to stay 5 years or so to get promoted want you to work cheaply and not move up for the next 5 years. At FactSet the rule is you can apply for a promotion after a year. However each time my particular manager would tell me how my position wasn't short-term and needed to be a long term 5-7 year position. They would tell me how they can't evaluate a potential promotion schedule until I'm in the position for 2 year. After 2 years of course, the promotion is in title, not really anything else.

The 3 weeks vacation is decent, but you end up working lots of additional hours. You really should get comp time for those hours.

There are other companies out there that treat their employees better."
"1121","2 years ago FactSet was a great place to work. The problem with a young workforce is they never saw a recession. Now everyone is scared for their jobs and their is backstabbing left and right.

With the Economy going bad, costs are being cut. People are disappearing left and right, but slowly, maybe one person a week. The problem seems to be some of these people were hard working, but made too much. A decent... company gives people a severance package layoff. But by avoiding a "" layoff"" and doing something gradual, these people are not being given anything. 

Benefits are also being cut. I noticed managers of 10 yrs having their blackberry being taken away. The blackberry increases productivity. Home internet (since many people work from home after leaving) is also no longer reimbursed. Cutting costs is a good thing, but not when you are cutting productivity with it.

Consulting and sales are being hit hard. Engineering and development are being spared.

Another problem is the FactSet way is to promote internally (which is good in moderation). The problem is this does not hold for all positions which require education and skills. I have noticed people one year out of college being promoted to very analytical positions to replace people who made too much. In the past, a client used to ask the consultants/specialist (who were experienced) questions. Now it seems the consultants/specialist are so new they are the ones asking the questions. What's scary is after a few years these people will probably be replaced themselves.

As the previous poster said, there's little of a career path. You may get a higher title and a little bit more money, but that's it. You are told to put in your time and be patient. But that's just to keep you there. When you are in your 30s and 40s and unemployed you better have done something during your time at FactSet (CFA, MBA?). Otherwise you will be wondering why you didn't take the job at Ernst & Young or Goldman Sachs like your friend out of college."
"1122","And some not-very-good people. While once a great all-around company to work for, FactSet has entered the recession with the opinion that morale and experience are expendable. An up-or-out mentality has taken hold, and paycheck is the gauge. Experienced hard working individuals are pushed aside because, as a previous poster notes, they are perceived as costing too much. So complaints go up and quality goes down....
FactSet's layoff plan is truly a few at a time, as quiet as possible. Contra previous postings, development and engineering are affected, as are internal people. It's hard not to notice your colleagues suddenly missing and no one talks of them anymore.
Finally, while the CFA support is great, the actual advancement opportunities are minimal. There's a lot of titles, but the not much power in them. To work at FactSet is to find yourself running faster and faster, simply to stay in place. Better to put in 2-5 years and take your skills somewhere else."
"1123","I think the compensation from FACTSET is much less compared to its competitor. It doesn't have any bonus plans. Its located in a very expensive to live area."
"1124","Just like most other places, you have to know how to develop transferable skills by working on a mostly non-transferable knowledge-base. It is, after all, unique software built on proprietary technology where knowing all the little details gives you a decision-making advantage, but serves little purpose elsewhere."
"1125","Sometimes have to deal with impatient, and somewhat unreasonable clients.  But that can happen just about anywhere."
"1126","Feedback from management is practically nil.  They're only recently decided to *start* adopting some industry-standard technologies (a bit late in the game, in my opinion).  A lot of the skills you learn there aren't really transferrable to other jobs as a result."
"1127","The worst part about FactSet is the management.  It's dominated by conservative white males who have no idea how to relate to most of the people in the company."
"1128","Some of the small company luster and feel has been lost. Management for eps under the veil of putting that money back to work through increased employee compensation. If your only interest is money, go elsewhere. If you're interested in community and life balance, may be a good fit."
"1129","If you are not an engineer, professional growth opportunities and team-building workshops and industry conferences are non-existent.

"1131","Beginning salaries are generally low and the office environment can be somewhat noisy making it difficult to concentrate at times."
"1132","Jobs that are client facing can be tough since some of the people that you might work with are under high pressure and pass that pressure on to you.  This might result in working long hours but FactSet provides all the tools to help the clients out while minimizing the burden on you.  Management roadmaps aren't always clear and concise or when they are they don't always have status updates communicated downward. ... Working with older technology or hardware can also be quite frustrating however management seems to understand and are working to eliminate unreliable or outdated technology as budgets and end of life agreements allow."
"1133","No year end bonuses based on performance."
"1134","Only thing that ever bothers me is the location, but that's hardly a problem in a relative sense, it's just a busy area."
"1135","If you want to be successful you pretty much need to give up everything outside of work (Other than socializing with coworkers at 11pm after work), even though there are few apparent rewards for doing so."
"1136","Disjointed organization, communication between department needs work. 

Issues with the competitive landscape of the industry. While being at a smaller company has many advantages in certain arenas it is difficult to compete with the resources and manpower of some of its top competitors. It is a case where the company needs to carefully pick their battles moving forward to avoid getting stepped on by the two... headed giant."
"1137","Pay can be a lot lower at the start but no indication of how much potential there is. No one helps you so much with career progression, there isn't any advice given, but more a chance for you to create opportunities for yourself."

There is a lot of turnover in their Consulting (support) and Systems Engineering (IT) departments for various reasons.  Consultants are quickly promoted, IT seems to be a poorly run department from talking to folks within the department.  Consultants normally go on to become either sales or product development.  The product... development department, in particular, has excellent leadership and has done an excellent job attracting top talent from outside the company."
"1142","It is a data driven company... somewhat boring at times"
"1143","Compensation is unclear and only in first year, and some employees have low morale because job responsibilities did not meet expectations. Strong work and life balance but lack of motivational compensation like bonus etc. for hard work so far."

"1146","Everyone is young - and right out of college."
"1147","The location of the headquarters, Norwalk, Ct isn't the best. There isn't a ton to do, however it is close enough to New York and not too far away from Boston."
"1148","The worst thing is that it is far from cities.
For some people who like suburban area it could be a good thing, but personally, as a young engineer, I would prefer more urban areas to live in."
"1149","Working the helpdesk at the beginning of your career.  Compensation is just okay.  Also in terms of career advancement it is pretty much sales or a product specialist.  There are some advancement opportunities in management but that is limited."

"1151","Need to have a better job description for consultants starting out, so they know what they are getting into."
"1152","Some of the work particularly on the support side that you receive in Consulting can be boring or tedious at times.  Additionally, most of your pay does not come in the form of bonuses but rather in the form of straight salary.  There are random bonus' for different things such as completion of each CFA level but not in general unless you are in sales or some area of product development.  Additionally, it seems to... be hard to distinguish yourself as an employee in the short-run and often this is reflected in consultants under two years of tenure having very similar employee reviews."
"1153","Some client facing positions require a fair amount of travel and extra work hours."
"1154","compensation could be better and the level of employee competence is somewhat variable.  the company mostly hires people right out of college, leading to a single-track mentality and a sort of cultish attitude.  that being said, if people leave the company, they are often welcomed back and management respects the new perspective that outside experience brings."
"1155","The Norwalk, CT location poses a challenge when hiring and retaining the best candidates."
"1156","Once you're in sales you're stuck there"
"1157","The location of the Headquarters is the biggest drawback.  Norwalk is unremarkable, traffic in that part of Connecticut is horrendous and the public transportation is challenging at best.

Sometimes the necessary formalism is overshadowed by learning, participation and getting things done.  This is great most of the time but frustrating when official career advancement becomes nebulous."
"1158","Consistently long hours. I would like to be paid more. I don't have many negatives to say. Negative reviews would only come from poor performers who don't work hard or disgruntled employees of a company FactSet acquired."
"1159","FactSet suffers only from some similar problems to larger corporations, the occasional inability to look 5 steps in the future etc."
"1160","If you are a college grad there are a lot of managers your own age and experience level.  Office politics are significant.  While not stereotyping everyone, there is a definite sense that folks are there for their own good and team work is typically a barter of political capital rather than an immerse, fun experience"
"1161","Political and promotions based more on popularity than work achieved."
"1162","After a year of hard work I got a very nice bonus, but no salary increase. I was told it's the economy. If they really valued me, give me some salary increase and some bonus. It would work out to the same this year. In 2010 when the economy is better is the only time they would see this increase. It tells me they only care about me for the short term."
"1163","Very long hours, nasty salespeople that never say thank you for the hard work you put in, but are happy to take credit for said work in front of management and clients.  Lots of inter-office politics (although it is a corporate environment so that's not surprising) and managers who shouldn't be managers.  There is also this attitude held by many senior Consultants that they shouldn't have to help you (being the new... guy) because no one helped them back in the day.  It leaves a very bad taste in your mouth.  They also coach young employees who have never worked at another company that there is no life after"
"1164","Probably varies by group as well, but my group had silly ""salary caps""; bonuses are rolled into the annual increase (i.e. it takes 2 years to fully collect on busting your butt year 1)."
"1165","Would rather have a better office in California."
"1166","Hours can be long. Compensation could be higher. I havent been around long enough yet to know how the compensation scale works as one advances within the company. Factset also does not have a ton of its own content."
"1167","Bad employees are rarely dealt with, this can result in lower morale for the good employees."
"1168","The salary is decent, especially when you start out working. But, you can probably get more elsewhere as time goes on and you become more experienced. Then again, you will have to work in a more stressful environment to get that higher salary, so it is up to you to decide what you want more. The annual feedback review process is annoying. You have to fill out a long for for yourself and a bunch of people you have... worked with during the year. The form is way too long with too many duplicate questions that you have to answer."
"1169","Pay is not that great. Too many men. I feel like the starting pay should be a lot higher than it is. For a consultant it is 50,000. They could stand to pay at least 55,000. I am new so i am not sure what the bonus or pay schedule is. they obviously make a point of concealing that upon employment but it would certainly be some information worth reporting to make up for the lousy pay!"
"1170","Fast growth = young leaders without much experience and lack of formal mentoring and leadership development programs leave many new managers fending for themselves."
"1171","Limited knowledge gaining opportunities, some departments are stuck in old technologies and do not want to change due to their leaders lack of interest in learning (but in gaining). People relations are neutral. Overall many manual operations for things can could have been automated long time ago."
"1172","Lots of information seems to get lost. You need to track everything to really know what's going on throughout the company. There's very little internal documentation, and what does exist is out of date. It's clear what you're rated on as far as promotions go, but there's less transparency about other aspects."
"1173","Hard to distinguish yourself as being a good engineer.  A lot of the day to day work is quite dull. Not very challenging most of the time.  Typically promotions go to people when they have been here a certain amount of time or are more pushy about getting them, rather than going to those who deserve them more."
"1174","Norwalk is not the greatest location."
"1175","Decisions made by the upper management may not be transparent enough. Sometimes engineers are left in the dark about decisions which could affect them. Engineering roles in London are limited at present. Most of the roles are not very exciting and may make it difficult to progress career wise."
"1176","No beer in the fridge.  Too many men."
"1177","Individual experience can vary widely based on manager.  Some managers work hard to help reports succeed, exposing achievements to upper level management and providing opportunities for growth and technical challenges, with proper feedback along the way.  Others not so much, which can be extremely frustrating if you'd like to get on the ""fast track."""
"1178","A mon avis, le seul point négatif est que les clients vous traitent parfois sans le moindre respect car ils ont besoin de quelque chose immédiatement. Ceci se produit souvent du côté IB.
En dehors de ça, tout me satisfait.
Appart from this, everything satisfies me."
"1179","You have to work pretty hard; long hours and work/life balance is not the easiest to pull off.  But, if you like what you do, it is actually not bad."
"1180","Amount of equity given is quite limited compared with what is offered in the area"
"1181","not innovative. top down driven. lots of legacy technology"
"1182","The company has grown so fast it hasn't always evolved from the small company approach to a bigger company. For many areas, that's a good thing, but it poses a problem in communication. The trickle down approach may have been good when there were 75 people here, but it doesn't work well when you have nearly 2,000 employees. I don't think Norwalk is a bad town, but the cost of living is very high for the actual... amenities you get from living here. However, it's convenient to both New York City and Boston, and the salaries cover the higher living costs."
"1183","From a technical perspective they do not follow some of the normal SDLC methodologies"
"1184","Not I can think of."
"1185","When the price of gas and food triples, your rent goes up 10%, and there's still no word on that bonus/raise you were promised 10 months ago that was supposed to back up that title promotion and the new team they gave you, it's time to reevaluate your options.  Also, their technology is obsolete, seized within a jungle of red tape, so if you're not careful your skill set will become obsolete with it."
"1186","Dealing with corporate / business growth can be difficult for time to time; however the atmosphere throughout the company still remains positive."
"1187","The perks are sort of mediocre; while there are free snacks, drinks, and lunch four days a week, the options are somewhat crappy. Recruiting standards are dropping in some cases, people seem to be quota-focused more than quality employee focused. There isn't a strong culture of terminating people that don't perform. Middle management is often weak, lacks direction, or completely negligent of their employees."
"1188","They pay less than the current market salary in the bay area. If you go anywhere else (startups or established companies), you will be guaranteed to make significantly more. QA is non-existing. The bug tracking is developed inhouse, and it sucks ass. My manager's manager loves reading email."
"1189","Norwalk is not the most glamorous place to live, but the people are really great there. They lag behind some other companies in areas such as flex hours and dress code, which isn't a big deal but is really nice to have."
