FactSet clearly hires certain pedigree of people and you will be guaranteed to be working with likely minded multinationals. There are plenty of informal afterwork events which enable you to connect with others. You will also be working with people who are brought up within the company since only a minority join the company... without going through the initial ""boot camp"".

Depending on the team you work for you are prone, sooner or later, to get a fair amount of responsibility early on. This can be quite stressful to start with, but eases after the learning curve on product and content balances out. If you can develop into a person who truly understands banking, buy and sell side connections, and other links and megatrends within the industry - you will be very valuable.

1232,140,"Salary, Benefits and Leaves:
Salary is great for starters with no experience. You can stay for at least 2 years to boost your salary as appraisal happens twice a year. Depending on your team, promotion cycles also happen twice a year and I can guarantee that promotion is fast. Benefits are also great (e.g. Medical, Internet, etc. Reimbursements, Health Benefits [HMO], dependencies, etc.). Work-Life Balance is... highly practiced by the people too. You'll be granted 30 days of leave (can be used as SL or VL) not counting other types of leaves (e.g. Maternity/Paternity, Bereavement, etc.). For software engineers, you will be on-call which allows you to garner time offs or offsets which are multiplied (e.g. 1.5 times during weekdays and 2 times during weekends/holidays). This means if you work as on-call during the holidays for 1 hour, you can offset 2 hours in one of your next shifts. This is accumulating so if you have 8 hours worth of offset, you can use it as a 1 day leave (without using your original pool of leaves). Working overtime is also strictly prohibited and highly discouraged. If you work overtime, it reflects negatively in your performance. Sick leaves are convertible to cash (at most 10,000 pesos) and unused VLs (max 5 days) can be carried over to the next year.

Career Opportunities:
Depending on your team, you will be exposed in different programming tech stacks. Some teams offers a wide range of programming tech stacks while some use in-house tools instead. Not only your technical skills will grow, your soft skills will also be improved and worked on as the management focuses both on productivity for the clients as well as people skills to maintain a healthy work environment. This helps maintain a positive culture with the minimum corporate politics and less work toxicity. 

Management:
If you aim to be an individual contributor, your technical skills will be greatly sharpened and your manager will surely help you on that. If you aim to be a team lead or manager, your manager will also coach you on how to be one by providing leadership opportunities as you work with your job. Managers will also assess you objectively (or at least minimum subjectivity).

Minor Stuff:
Free shuttle (from glorietta to its offices and back, for 10 PM - 6 AM, a home-drop door-to-door service is provided). Unlimited Drinks, Free Snacks, Workshops, Sportsfests, etc. Company phone for on-call engineers with unlimited calls/text/internet.",3,#VALUE!
