"139","Salary, Benefits and Leaves:
Salary is great for starters with no experience. You can stay for at least 2 years to boost your salary as appraisal happens twice a year. Depending on your team, promotion cycles also happen twice a year and I can guarantee that promotion is fast. Benefits are also great (e.g. Medical, Internet, etc. Reimbursements, Health Benefits [HMO], dependencies, etc.). Work-Life Balance is... highly practiced by the people too. You'll be granted 30 days of leave (can be used as SL or VL) not counting other types of leaves (e.g. Maternity/Paternity, Bereavement, etc.). For software engineers, you will be on-call which allows you to garner time offs or offsets which are multiplied (e.g. 1.5 times during weekdays and 2 times during weekends/holidays). This means if you work as on-call during the holidays for 1 hour, you can offset 2 hours in one of your next shifts. This is accumulating so if you have 8 hours worth of offset, you can use it as a 1 day leave (without using your original pool of leaves). Working overtime is also strictly prohibited and highly discouraged. If you work overtime, it reflects negatively in your performance. Sick leaves are convertible to cash (at most 10,000 pesos) and unused VLs (max 5 days) can be carried over to the next year.

Career Opportunities:
Depending on your team, you will be exposed in different programming tech stacks. Some teams offers a wide range of programming tech stacks while some use in-house tools instead. Not only your technical skills will grow, your soft skills will also be improved and worked on as the management focuses both on productivity for the clients as well as people skills to maintain a healthy work environment. This helps maintain a positive culture with the minimum corporate politics and less work toxicity. 

Management:
If you aim to be an individual contributor, your technical skills will be greatly sharpened and your manager will surely help you on that. If you aim to be a team lead or manager, your manager will also coach you on how to be one by providing leadership opportunities as you work with your job. Managers will also assess you objectively (or at least minimum subjectivity).

Minor Stuff:
Free shuttle (from glorietta to its offices and back, for 10 PM - 6 AM, a home-drop door-to-door service is provided). Unlimited Drinks, Free Snacks, Workshops, Sportsfests, etc. Company phone for on-call engineers with unlimited calls/text/internet."

I determined relatively quickly that FactSet was a place where I... would  build a career. Several years later, I have never been more confident that I made the right decision. FactSet continues to be a place where I have challenged myself and grown personally and professionally.

"692","People good and the culture is  a fun one."
"693","I think best parts about FactSet are the people and the exposure to the financial industry.
FactSet clearly hires certain pedigree of people and you will be guaranteed to be working with likely minded multinationals. There are plenty of informal afterwork events which enable you to connect with others. You will also be working with people who are brought up within the company since only a minority join the company... without going through the initial ""boot camp"".

Depending on the team you work for you are prone, sooner or later, to get a fair amount of responsibility early on. This can be quite stressful to start with, but eases after the learning curve on product and content balances out. If you can develop into a person who truly understands banking, buy and sell side connections, and other links and megatrends within the industry - you will be very valuable.

The company benefits are great in my opinion, the schemes are generous and allow you to include your better half in them too.

Financial industry will need market data solutions today and in the future and there won't be a shortage of work on this field (think about regulation!)."

"1136","Culture is overall strong and positive but varies by office. The people are extremely nice, rather smart and collaborative. Like everywhere, if you are really good you can kill it here over the long haul. Middle pack performers probably lag industry peers and the bottom gets flushed maybe a little too slow.

Do not have to work hard/ stay late/ think outside of the box.  Compensation is very tight, and recognition does not sync with intellectual capital, or contribution.  Will look great on a resume for a few years of experience, or while you find another... role with a client.  After you've been there for a bit, many come in late, lie about appointments in calendar, or work from home.  If you can get through the interview process, and seem to fit in with the culture, very easy to make a few key contacts, pretend you are an asset, and never have to really work.  Especially when you can choose the people who peer review you."

It's far from being a torture chamber, and there is a lot camaraderie among mid-level folks and between diverse teams.  I am a good observer and will say that some departments have been favored over others, insofar as layoff proceedings and business needs go.

Many of my closest friends are people I met at FactSet and I think most people stay at the company a lot longer than they would somewhere else because of the close ties that they forge with their training class.There is a young culture mainly because the company recruits consultants right out of college. There are also great health benefits and a 401k match program."

The team ethic at FactSet is second to none and selfless way in which team members help others achieve goals for the benefit of all leads to great rewards. Senior execs are happy to speak with new recruits in the hallways and no question is off limit. It really helps... cement the feeling that my opinions are taking and considered seriously and courteously."
"1244","Financial rewards are very good indeed when compared with other software companies in London and the rest of the UK, particularly the starting salary. Other benefits are also great, there is a good pension scheme and free lunch, snacks, fruit and drinks are provided every day.

There are lots of opportunities for growth in both technical knowledge and career (such as management roles) for those who perform well (I... was able to achieve a senior role and management position within a few years thanks to high performance). Employees are encouraged to take on projects outside of their immediate responsibilities in order to help them grow, which also brings some interesting variation to the job.

The environment is definitely engineering focussed and very relaxed, senior managers chat and have lunch with new recruits. There are regular social events that are fully paid for by the company, things like go-karting, bowling, etc, which are great fun and many people regularly socialise together after work too. This kind of environment has been very hard to find in software enginering jobs in London in my past experience."

The benefits are next to none, the pension plan is great, the free lunch is a nice perk, and you get free dinner on those nights where you are stuck working late. 

The actual work is quite fun as well, you get to be... social and go visit clients frequently. Depending on which team you are you can travel frequently.

"1293","FactSet is a great company to work for, but the Consultant position is not for everyone.  If you are interested in Finance and technology, both, than this role may be perfect for you. However, the technical aspect can be overwhelming for someone who did not expect it."
"1294","FactSet is a good place to start a career"
"1295","The best reasons to work at FactSet are:
1. work/life balance - engineers here are not overworked, and I think they are more productive because of this
2. hands-off management - you get a lot of freedom when developing your projects, and there is little micromanagement
3. atmosphere - it is a very collegial environment, with people doing serious work but able to have fun at the same time"

"1314","You are able to buy FactSet stock through the ESPP plan.  Because we get the 15% discount off a low point in a 3 month period, we tend to get a nice arbitrage play.  Management runs the company very well from a shareholder's point of view.  Any outside investor should buy FactSet stock.  

Good health benefits.  Interesting work if you're put on a good project."
"1315","Free Lunch.

CFA support.
Collegial environment.
Good exposure to HF, IB and IM workflow."
"1316","Good, young company. Has the potential to be a great place to work. They seem to like to promote from within in certain areas so there is some growth available."
"1317","Its been only a year since Factset was established here in the Philippines and for a new company in this country it is doing fairly well in starting the business. From recruiting to integrating as a new information business in the Philippines. They also prioritize benfits over the basic salary same with other factset branches and offer free drinks, well there's a limit to the drinks you can take (about 3 is the... maximum). It provides opportunities especially to fresh graduates and those without work experience. The company provides free shuttle service in which they are fetched from a pick up point and dropped of to the company and the shift that works til midnight are the ones who maxmize this service because they are fetched and dropped off in each respective homes. The company also has a youthful feel because majority of the employees are between the age of 22-25."

> Very few places can offer so much responsibility and compensation right out of college for individuals who didn't go to top universities (ivy league, etc)."
"1326","Like the previous poster said benefits are unmatched. Healthcare benefits, 401K match, and stock program make life less stressful. However the benefits are used as a reason for lower raises/bonuses throughout the years."
"1327","Good benefits
Decent pay
Colleagues are both friendly and capable"

"1336","Free lunch, exposure to clients"
"1337","-Young, fun employees
-Decent pay, especially out of college
-Oppotunity for promotion"
"1338","Free soda (though the selection has slimmed down) and $8 a day at the deli (though the food gets old after a while).

However the free lunch basically means instead of a lunch break you sell yourself for $8. Assuming you make 50k+, $8 a day for 4 days isn't worth it."
"1339","Good people and fee soda (non-caffeine)"
"1340","Free lunch, free soda, CFA support, some very good people, and a great education on the whole industry, on a great platform."
"1341","Its a great work environment, very relaxed. Good benefits! free food! 
It has very young crowd which likes to hangout together."
"1342","One of the best things about the company is a general openness and helpfulness from colleagues. You can cut the red tape whenever you want without drawing much criticism. The benefits package is hard to beat with every new employee starting off w/ 3 weeks vacation +5 personal/sick days (+1 vacation day for every year worked). Free lunch, snacks, and drinks keeps the warm community atmosphere. We also have... community-involvement events to ward off the corporate juggernaut stereotype. Senior management is mostly organically grown, so they usually make good decisions. In the marketplace, this company is definitely nimble about M&A and taking advantage of opportunities, so I would say it has strong business potential. The Norwalk, CT headquarters is set in naturscape to help de-stress when you need it."
"1343","FactSet has a great work environment.  The people you work with are young, intelligent and fun.  There is a lot going for the company, so it feels great to be a part of the company's growth."
"1344","There's a five-year probation period.  You have a really long time to prove yourself, so, take advantage of it.  Plus, they give you a lot of independence early on (enough to hang yourself with--I've seen it)."
"1345","The best reason to work at FactSet is the people.  They are really great and there is a real feeling of community"
"1346","Great people, good long term growth prospects, relative stability. Although we all would like to mak more money, I could not be happier with my decision to join FactSet right out of college."
"1347","Flexible environment
Long-term employees are valued - Company is loyal to longterm staff."
"1348","Oportunities for professional growth and incredible industry exposure."
"1349","FactSet is not really a small company but it maintains a small company culture in which the goal is more important than appearance.  You get the opportunity to participate in product development quite early, meaning that you can find your work reflected in the application within months of joining.  At the same time colleagues and management are very willing to share knowledge, which makes it a straight forward task... to do a good job."
"1350","Benefits, Work Life Balance, and ability to work remotely when taking care of personal issues.  The free lunches (mon - thurs), open stocked kitchen is quite an incentive and the ability to charge meals is a good way to keep up morale and improve productivity at a relatively low cost.  Above average health care compensation also is strong reason to stay with the firm.  FactSet has consistently taken a conservative... approach to finance management placing them in a strong position in a tight economy.  The sector also helps ensure job security since data and analytics become ever more important during times of extreme market volatility."
"1351","Benefits, free lunches, intelligent team members, and strong company."
"1352","Working for a small, but quickly growing company has a great feeling to it.  The culture is amazing, there's every sort of person around you and everyone is very helpful, communicative, and easy to get along with outside of work.  The environment is laid back but professional so; I always feel like I need to work to the best of the ability, not because I'm told to, but because everyone around me is so ridiculously... intelligent and good at what they do.  It's really motivating to work around so many intelligent people.  Working from home is very flexible and not frowned upon at all, but you still want to make it to work everyday just to be around your peers.  I really love that engineering managers are expected to continuously perform and not just sink into management roles."
"1353","If you're willing to work hard the rewards are there. Unfortunately we don't make it easy for our new hires in Consulting and Software Engineering to see that personal and professional growth are rewarded in due course. I consider most of those I work with to be more than just coworkers, and I couldn't think of a better group of people to spend most of my waking hours with. Of course there are exceptions, but that... is true everywhere."
"1354","Intelligent and talented coworkers, flexible and creative, rewards hard work. From my expirience I would say this is one of the most rewarding and interesting jobs I have ever had. Great place to launch a career as it can open many doors down the road."
"1355","Great place to start a career and learn about the industry and landscape. The environment is very flat so there isn't any great barrier between yourself and management and even senior management. There are a lot of opportunities as we are still growing to find what you like to do. Just need to be proactive as you create your own path."
"1356","- Excellent work life balance
- Relaxed company culture
- Generally nice people
- Lots of exposure to many different clients"
"1357","Pay: FactSet employs many recent college grads, so the starting pay is very competitive with any other entry level job. they promote from within and are generous with bonuses (2x year). I do think the starting salaries could be higher.

Respect: Pretty good, you dont want to step on anybodys toes - you won't be held in high regard. if you work hard and bring good ideas to the table, you'll earn your spot here.... there are some people who have been here too long and think they run the place, when they really aren't very senior at all.

Benefts: Great. I pay nothing for medical. We get free lunch too. Always a whole kichen full of snacks, drinks, fruit, coffee, etc.

Job Security: Good. Company is growing very rapidly and has been for the last umpteen years.

Work/Life: I've never had a problem. You do have to work hard and put in hours if you want to get promoted, but I've never had an issue if i need to leave for an appointment.

Career growth: promote from within, most people are promoted w/in 2 years"
"1358","Great way to learn about the financial industry without being in banking. Growing company with great people. Everyone receives a laptop so any if not most employees are able to work from home. In terms of when you take vacation and time off (as well as doctors appointments, leaving work early, etc.) if you respect FactSet, FactSet will respect you. If management trusts that you're not cutting corners, they are very... reasonable and flexible with your needs and schedule."
"1359","Overall the people are pretty nice and definitely a very smart crew"
"1360","Great work environment, awesome people"

"1363","Good opportunties to work on various projects."
"1364","Factset has a Great work/life balance."
"1365","Great benefits: Particularly for the CFA, FactSet pays for your prep and the exam as well as gives you a bonus if you pass. The free lunch is also a plus as well as all the fringe benefits. The company is smaller but growing which always you a lot of opportunity if you want it."
"1366","The environment is laid back compared to other software companies.
I personally like my manager."
"1367","FactSet is made up of mostly very intelligent, hardworking, motivated employees.  These people are also very helpful and thoughtful individuals for the most part and not ""cut-throat"" like others that work in the financial services or engineering/software industuries.  FactSet has great benifits for its employees such as paid lunches, great health,dental, eye etc. insurance as well as educational assistance... (reembursement).   One of the best reasons to work for FactSet is to exposure you get to many different investment professionals and firms whether buy or sell side."
"1368","Très exigeant, excellentes opportunités, environnement de travail très positif, avantages, alimentation et boissons gratuites, entreprise à forte croissance et au futur brillant, mes collègues"
"1369","Talented co-workers, challenging assignments, cities are nice to live in."
"1370","Young atmosphere and a lot of fun to work for."
"1371","benefits, vacation, lifestyle, working from home..."
"1372","FactSet provides excellent opportunities to engineers, starting from the moment they are hired, to move up both in title and in compensation.  If you are willing to work, then you will be greatly satisfied with the company's willingness to make you happy.  The environment is casual yet highly productive, and the management layers are nearly all previous engineers (right up to the president!) so managers understand... the actual process of development, and are therefore very supportive and very efficient and insightful in their project decisions."
"1373","FDS has a very nurturing atmosphere that allows software engineers, especially those coming out of school, to grow their skills and learn from the software industry. They are very happy to have their engineers go to conferences, read books, and learn from each other, and ease you into the professional software process with tutorials and lessons. They also prepare you for management after you've shown the ability to... take on the responsibilities, and are supportive if you want to stay a pure software development role as well. The people there are a ton of fun to work with, and are hired from the best schools in the country."
"1374","nurturing environment, mostly energetic corps of employees"
"1375","The people! It's a great environment.  I've been here 1.5 years and already been promoted. I'm learning new things every day.  The client interaction requires an entry-level person to interact with very senior-level finance professionals on a daily basis.
