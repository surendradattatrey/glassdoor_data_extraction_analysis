"1","I think the lower rungs of the employment chain make the worst money. If you pay your dues, you might get promoted."
"2","Developers are expected to be on call twenty four hours for support of systems.  Fun once in a while but can quickly become too much if you are working on a downstream systems.  Endless data changes will keep you beyond busy."
"3","An entry level security guard will advance further than someone with a degree who works on the trading floor as a Market Reporter. I TOTALLY AGREE with the other reviews."
"4","Management can be incompetent--particularly managment at the floor operations level.  Review system is ridiculous-almost have to walk on water to recieve a 3 out of 5 on rating system."
"5","Unwillingness to change the set ways of some officers."
"6","structured, more political than it used to be 4 years ago, top heavy, integration issues, technology division does not operate uniformly, QA problems are solved by throwing more people, too much manual testing, useless directors"
"7","Departments are siloed both internally and externally.  Communication is not the best inter-departmentally.  With the size of the company being what it is one would think the company would be much more nimble than it currently is.  It takes a long time to get simple little things completed unlike the large impact project."
"8","Seniority generally matters quite a bit in promoting.  Generally I did not find much to complain about at CME Group.  After the Board of Trade merger there were substantial layoffs, but those were caused by the merger and do not seem to carry over at all."
"9","Organizational structure is questionable and manager performance can be sub par at times. Workload can be somewhat demanding at times and will often require additional hours to be put it on the weekend for the busier weeks. With a large IT department within the company there are times when communication is not effectively established across given departments which in turn hinders the work process. 

The overall... structure of the company is efficient, but at times it seems as if the two divisions are organizations of their own which can cause some slight problems. Other than that, in my time there I didn't experience too many major downsides to CME Group."
"10","Across groups, management does not work together, preventing the transfer of knowledge and lessons learned across the enterprise.  Poor development practices enforced and encouraged in non mission critical areas.  The ""heroes"" are rewarded over people who prevent the issues in the first place.  The heavy bureaucracy of a large exchange prevents the introduction of new software development practices without a hard... fight."
"11","Poor work life balance, hope you don't like your Saturdays and when random Production issues occur.  Cliquish, if you're not in with the right crowd you will no receive the same treatment when it comes to bonuses, promotions etc.  If you're good at playing the game, you'll be fine.  People hold on to knowledge, don't want to share."
"12","mediocre compensation - especially at lower ranks"
"13","Too much politics and favoritism. People are more interested in oneupmanship than actually getting any work done. Hard work should be recognized and rewarded appropriately."
"14","* Work / Life balance can be challenging at times.  Depending on your group / role, there may be frequent Saturday work.
* Crazy work pace at times. Many high priority projects
* Some counter-productive employees seem to be able to survive and remain employed
* Not a major con, but you will see a good amount of nepotism 
* Raises were mostly flat last couple of years."
"15","managers are promoted because they are great at their jobs and have industry expertise however, they receive no guidance on how to treat the staff they are responsible for.  

Huge learning curve in the futures industry when you are coming out of college.  There is very little formal training."
"16","Management is underqualified and leaves employees feeling that they can do a better job than their superiors

The education courses are a waste of time because over half the class is used explaining common issues and does not leave enough time to even complete material"
"17","While I understand that it is the norm to have cubicle farms at larger companies, I find them to be limiting.  My boss was a 5 min walk from my desk and I felt like I had little interaction with them.  The corporate culture was also unlike some of my previous experiences, not bad, just a very 9-5 vibe with many employees with very little passion."
"18","If you don't like to put in the hours... Don't bother. If you don't like constant changes... don't bother. If you like to get settled in doing the same thing every day.... don't bother. Change is constant.... change is good"
"19","CME Group has a very deep hierarchical organization which leads to a lot of politics, turf battles bringing a lot inefficiencies, unflexibilities, difficulty to have important decisions made."
"20","The adage ""It's not what you know but who you know"" appears  to be the rule in many of the hiring and promotional decisions."
"21","Please listen to the feedbacks and take action . It is not worth just collecting it once in every 6 months."
"22","CME does an awful job of handling their consultants. They treat them very poorly going out the door. I saw two instances where giving CME 2 weeks notice worked against those people. In one instance the consultant gave notice at 9 AM and was kicked out before 10 AM. The second instance a consultant gave notice EOD Monday and was let go EOD Tuesday. More than a few supervisors have less than stellar communication... skills (i.e. snarky, rude, snide, condescending commentary is the norm)."
"23","lack of direct communication channel"
"24","It sometimes seems apparent that we are a small company that grew very quickly (due to mergers and / or  acquisitions)."
"25","Managers show favoritism in who gets promoted, the least capable become managers because they are favorites of the boss. Incompetent people are allowed to stay even though they aren't producing at all. Tons of drama all the time due to unprofessional behavior by managers. Employees who act like kids are allowed to continue in their behavior. Bonuses have dried up and raises are very low compared to what they used to... be."
"26","Like any large corporation, there's lots of red tape and bureaucracy in between you and getting your job done. Politics and personality defects sometimes get in the way of good software engineering. It is a fight to get open-source solutions approved."
"27","limited flexibility in terms of transitioning departments, lots of politics, and never enough drama"
"28","Career advancement is not clear.  The culture of favortism is strong.  Senior Management has a tendency to advance their lunch-buddies.  This leaves little or no room for advancement to managerial roles.  You literally have to leave your department to move up within the company."
"29","-cultural shift as a result of exponential growth (more corporate/structured/rigid)
-senior mgmt not in tune with level/volume of work being done at staff level"
"30","My department has little promotion ability."
"31","Hard to move around the firm"
"32","Technical experts lack competency relative to other industry"
"33","Employee and trading floor morale is down in the gutter. Floors that were once occupied with staff are now empty halls. The majority in charge manages from Chicago, which is pretty frustrating if you work in New York."
"34","Promotions and compensation not evaluated the same across the department and departments and management doesn't keep the department informed."
"35","CME Group's culture closely resembles the culture of a bad high school movie. Everyone who is in the ""in-crowd"" can expect to receive favorable raises and promotions, in spite of ability. Those who are ""outsiders"" can forget it. Education and ability are not equally rewarded, while incompetence is handsomely rewarded. And if you have the misfortune of belonging to a minority group, your chances of advancement are... nonexistent. Before the misguided purchase of the CBOT, one of the bylines of the CME was ""the Exchange of Ideas."" Unfortunately, a lot of the prevailing ideas concerning fairness and diversity at the Merc resemble some of the more odious ideas which were prevalent during the 19th century."
"36","This is the worst place to work for, for a good software developer. All the guys who can't program or can't do anything productive get promoted to Associated Directors. Then the same crappy folks are in charge of reviewing the performance of bright developers who do the real work ! It's like an inverse pyramid, they have got the rotten people on top, on an average there are 2 managers for each dev/qa/analyst person.... Lot of red tape, politics goes on than real work, with so many Associate Directors it is normal to expect I presume.
One person takes the status, another person print it in excel and brings it to the meetings, another person reads it in the meetings, another person takes meeting notes and emails it out.
It takes on an average 10 years to build a new system cause of mismanagement and poor or no vision at all, that's why most work is maintenance/support work. 

All these factors naturally tend to promote mediocrity."
"37","The tendency to hire outside talent for high-level positions is disconcerting and underscores a lack of in-house career advancement and development. Also, politicking can get annoying."
"38","Too political, no compensation, no room for growth. Promotions are not based around any set criteria and given arbitrarily by senior management. No performance raises or even much praise for a job well done."
"39","Management needs leadership training. Some of the junior management have no clue on management and people skills. They can be traffic cops with attitude!"
"40","Highly competitive and fast changing environment means one has to study in order to keep up with both the many technology and strategic initiatives."
"41","Very difficult to advance without politcal connections"
"42","One of the most frustrating organizations I've ever been a part of.  Directors don't show up to meetings and don't prepare for anything.  There is a total lack of leadership and reinvestment in employees careers.  Directors (its really only one bad egg) controls junior managers in such a way that they are terrified to manage their employees properly.  A the first instance that an employee shows a desire to move... ahead the directors knock them back because they are afraid the employee will potentially move ahead of them because they are far more competent.  Apathy is so widespread throughout company that it seems as if the whole operation may fold at any point.  Utterly no employee reviews.  Zero transparency on compensation rewards and promotions.  Truely a disasterous organization that can largely be attributed to one persons power and controlling tendencies."
"43","bureaucratic and at times extremely political"
"44","Trying to create a culture but won't happen without management buy-in."
"45","If you're not in the in-crowd or if you're non-European, you're prospects for raises and promotional activities are nonexistent."
"46","Unrealized potential from junior employees because of inflated egos on the senior management side. Leadership on the operations side is completely and utterly incompetent. A very demeaning and frustrating envronment to work in. Junior Managers are absolutely inept and have barely any financial/capital markets knowledge beyond repeating key words, which they may have heard from an even more inept director in a... self-fulfilling and meaningless meeting; all as a result of a constant state of fear from senior management. Constant culture of lying to clients out of fear from internal retribution from specific directors; unethical, complete breakdown in communication, hiding/lying/back-stabbing and overall in desperate need of a rigorous cleaning up of management structure."
"47","the firm is getting too large to move quickly"
"48","Costs more to work for them as an intern than you actually make.  Work can be mundane and completely unnecessary at times.  Work to make work."
"49","need investement"
"50","Some communication lacking between divisions/teams."
"51","-Very poor pay relative to similar jobs in industry
-Very poor treatment (lack of respect, lack of encouragement, lack of promotion)"
"52","--- Outsourcing key development positions
--- Trimming stateside head count in dramatic numbers
--- No room for advancement
--- Overall direction is no longer clear
--- Sadly, we are no longer encourging talented people to stay.  High turn over ratio within the company
--- No management training - they are moving individuals into management positions that they are completely unqualified for but they are not... providing them with the skills [advanced training] to succeed.  This driving talented people out of the company to escape bad management.  When a stateside employee exits, we replace them with off shores consultants."
"53","don't cover up and endorse it"
"54","Not everyone will get the same recognition immediately, but you keep doing the good jon, will get the appreciation eventually"
"55","big egos, nerdy techs, politics, inefficient managers trying desperately to hide the fact that they are two stations beyond their competency level. Insulated leadership. Arrogance with a capital A."
"56","Good old boy network.  Lots of Fraternity buddies in various departments. Just playing at Agile Development, not practicing it.  If you are not ""in"" with one of these groups, advance can be very difficult."
"57","Keep up the good work."
"58","Employee skill levels vary. Generally older community than at an IT-centric company. Occasionally bureaucracy can impede progress."
"59","Not enough communication and mentorship from leadership."
"60","Poor organization both inter- and intra-department, unclear or non-existent job descriptions, often long work days, ineffective performance evaluation system."
"61","Usually, management does not want to hear about your opinions or ideas. The subjective annual reviews are often unfair and do not reflect the actual effetiveness of the employee."
"62","Limited career growth; limited access to other departments within the company; mundane daily work"
"63","it is a flat company"
"64","No proper management.Lack of proper goals.No clear deadlines.And complete confusion inside the team."
"65","Limited career opportunities, especially for non-Chicago employees and market reg employees"
"66","Overall, it seems like a lot of people are unhappy with management and looking to leave. I'm not sure if they are the type of people that will be happy working anywhere. You have to do a lot of writing and defend your work with data (often times over and over again). Sometimes it feels like you are assigned more work than you could possibly complete in the time given (isn't that every job though). However, people... and management are usually supportive and understanding of the time needed for the tasks assigned."
"67","Poor peformance of stock price"
"68","You can not solve all problems by spending money"
"69","Lack of loyalty, management unavailable or unaware, little room for advancement"
"70","Politics in the workplace take precedence over hard work."
"71","Treatment of employees should be a little more personal.
Management should be more empowered"
"72","Work at home is not promoted, even 1 day a week."
"73","There tends to be a lot of corporate politics in the organization."
"74","poor management and HR, cover for each other at staff's expense"
"75","Muchos sistemas legados a causa de la integración de muchas empresas y sistemas que se van eliminando y consolidando de forma gradual."
"76","Too many management layers, not enough doers, lots of red tape before decisions are made, very slow to react.  This company is successful because it is huge.  Losing market share to smalle, more nimble competitors."
"77","Most of the leadership and managers are great, some managers are not great.  There is a slow reaction time to address unprofessional behavior in some departments."
"78","Cost of Living, Low Pay"
"79","Demanding environment with increasing work pressures. Culture is spoken, but not lived. Golden hand-cuffs apply here... pay, bonus, benefits and stock options make it a challenge to leave."
"80","Promotion policies are not uniform across departments. Company has started off shoring lot of work so I am not sure about the future of my job."
"81","Always going after the shiniest new technology with little regard for how to run and maintain what we already have."
"82","Establish training program"
"83","Sometimes works gets monotonous and tiring. Saturday testing becomes difficult at times."
"84","Senior Management is all about keeping their own job, the hell with everybody .

no real upward movement in the company ."
"85","Continue to value employer contributions. Overall you are doing a good job."
"86","Coffee in the break room isn't the greatest."
"87","Pretty political and still has a very much ""he or she are one of our people"" type of situation for promotions
It isn't CME Group's fault but the intense regulatory environment sometimes forces employees to do work that  adds little value to the process or the organization but is done anyway because a regulator asked for it"
"88","They do not keep justice, they do not like results.  Its not enough just to be professional at CME."
"89","(1) There are very few competent people working here.  Most of the best staff leave within six months to a year after joining.
(2) Unabashed favoritism, nepotism, and racism 
(3) Extreme amounts of bureaucracy to the point where real work almost never gets done
(4) Very poor management;  I have never seen it this bad before
(5) There is no culture to speak of; hypocrisy and double talk are the norm of... management
(6) Employees that do not go along with some of these issues are often harasses and retaliated against"
"90","There is no work life balance. You are considered to be on call all the time. 
Software development is always rushed to the point that there is rarely any design, certainly no documentation - even in the code. It is all about getting a feature in and released - testing seems to be in production."
"91","No real hope for career advancement. Incompetent people mostly fill middle management.
Promotions are given to brown nosers. It does not matter how smart you are or how much you contribute.
Low base pay and bonuses.
If you are smart, you won't learn much here. Most of your time will be spent wiping the drool off your managers' faces.
No one really cares for your opinion on anything. Give them a good idea and you... will politely be told to shut up and sit down. You are simply to do what you are told. Do it while praising your manager for coming up with such an innovative solution and maybe you'll get promoted."
"92","There is a tendency to defer to the ""this is just how we do things"" type of attitude and there are a lot of inefficiencies that can be difficult to navigate."
"93","Computerized trading and direction of trading tech"
"94","Inconsistent business goals that could forecast business road map and company prospect."
"95","Cut the workforce by 20%."
"96","MAJOR politics in action.  Promotions are less about performance and more about coolness factor"
"97","too much bureaucracy too bad"
"98","political, way too much advantage to big firms. Too worried about stock price"
"99","Good ole' boys club.  If you are ""in"" it is good.  If you are not it sucks."
"100","Can be bureaucratic and slow-moving sometimes."
"101","if your not part of the cool kids club you will definitely hit a major roadblock at some point in your career."
"102","Career advancement is difficult because people don't ever leave! Lots of management layers."
"103","Bad middle management and no concern for employees personal issues."
"104","Not a greacompany to work for if you're not accepted by middle management team."
"105","Could not find any"
"106","Senior management, start and never finish mentality / lack of accountability"
"107","They aren't fair to their minority employees. This company is full of office politics. And believe me when I say nepotism is alive and well at the CME!"
"108","Constant stream of work demands with no prioritization.  Resources to get the work done can be tight.  Evolving global presence."
"109","Large management group with lots of layers that has trouble prioritizing. Oversized board that is still fairly involved in management decisions. Uneven quality of senior managers."
"110","You will get ignored if you work in anywhere but Chicago. They constantly ask for feedback but don't make changes."
"111","It seems like it can take a long time to get a promotion."
"112","A challenging work ethic along with travel requirements"
"113","Retailiation if go 2HR and they will resort to lies to get you fired. Lynching of careers needs to stop."
"114","They should teach employees how to watch the market from beginning."
"115","Serious lack of inter-departmental communication.  Serious lack of documentation.  Company is constantly going through re-organization so there's always a concern for lay-offs.  Poor management decision making (at least in the department I was in) and they don't seem to know what they want employees to do from day to day.  Job description postings are seldom accurate for what you would actually be required to... perform.   Management doesn't like it when an employee out-performs his/her superiors.  Company doesn't really look for people to be innovative...they would prefer employees to be grouped in a box....no movement or reward for ingenuity, creativity, or thinking outside of the box.  Extremely focused on cost savings to the point the company will forego important investments in CRM, reporting tools, and other technologies necessary to carry the company into the next generation of growth.

Also, it's a relatively small company so movement (depending on which department you're in) can be slow or negligible.  Many good employees have left because there's no room to grow upward."
"116","Recent layoffs and policy changes were not well thought out.  Laid off very talented, driven professionals with no solid explanation.  Significantly reduced tuition reimbursement program that was key for more junior staff and a differentiator that led to committed, loyal staff.  CEO is known for colorful style, but is often sexist and racist (against anyone that isn't brown) and his use of off colorful language... should not be accepted at a industry-leading, large public company."
"117","Go through the political swamp. Culture is not healthy. They can fire you for no reason, just because you do not fit into their games :)"
"118","Company does not have any discernible process to execute initiatives, very little clarity provided to employees regarding objectives, poor training, middle managers lack accountability, abundance of politics"
"119","May be difficult to work with certain teams/ people within the company. Lack of collaboration and communication often goes unaddressed."
"120","Little chance of advancement unless you know how to golf with the senior management or you turn your life over to the company
The company displays poor organizational skills and lacks the necessary decision making skills to allow it to move forward.
Management refuses to take ownership of their initiatives."
"121","Late in delegating work and lack clarity in designing the problem statement."
"122","Train employees more formally or at all please"
"123","Good benefits
They don't appreciate the employees that made them what they are today
Great for internships - not full-time employment"
"124","Political environment, top heavy, easy to just get by"
"125","Internship was too freelance. Wish I would've learned much more as a developer from my superiors and team members."
"126","Closed rigid culture with very formal lines of communication
Overly concerned with protocol and highly bureaucratic internal processes
Performance evaluations are highly political, despite what’s initially communicated its difficult to advance, salaries stagnant, bonuses below target"
"127","However, if you get a horrific manager, you life could be like a hell. Don't count on HR as they are clearly onesided in order to keep their jobs."
"128","Advancement on the business side is driven by seniority, not talent. Extremely bureaucratic and there is a lot of middle management, most of whom don't really add value."
"129","It can be extremely political once you move into a leadership role.  They are also moving toward more outsourcing and managed services which could make your job harder."
"130","nothing specific, like everywhere in corporate America, an employee's experience largely depends on his/her manager and the immediate team."
"131","More demotions and layoffs than promotions the past few years.  Arrogant senior management.  Arcane business knowledge valued more highly than technical competence.  Many manual processes that could easily be automated but are not.  Many outdated legacy systems.  Severe risk aversion that inhibits improvements.  Locked-down computers.  Big brother surveillance.  Depressing office environment.  Awful coffee.  Low... expectations for developer productivity."
"132","Follows boom and bust cycles of the markets."
"133","- Lack of structure in program
- Compensation could be better"
"134","No parking, salary is ok"
"135","Because of various security measures, my computer runs very slowly. I literally spend more time building and deploying my code than I do programming. There are a lot of meetings. The work is not very challenging. While working there I've only written a couple of cool things, and I elected to do them.  Most of the work is pretty cut-n-paste. People are a little too professional, and it is boring to work there.  The... security measures create frustrating technical challenges. They have recently been laying people off and I worry that the good times are ending."
"136","Silo-ed environment, a lot of politics to move through"
"137","There has been a lot of change in the recent past"
"138","Not an intern-to-employee program
Periods of no work, when you're simply sitting and waiting."
"139","recent layoffs were not very well planned and lost lot of talented people.
New leadership is not handling thing verey well"
"140","CME has some challenges though especially since there are a lot of people that have been there for awhile and do not necessarily add a lot of value. There is a lack of persistence in some areas as well as people become component"
"141","As of now I don't feel like I can list any cons, time will tell, will update."
"142","Consistently laying off respected employees for cost reasons.  Moral goes down, people get back to work and try to forget and it happens again. Its obvious that they want to cut more but don't  want to pay the severance checks. Then the grueling hours come and they wait to see who breaks.  Someday this will crash something important. Lots of technical debt being incurred.  Come and learn but don't get lulled by the... music."
"143","Internal politics, over-processed for not that large of a company (2700 people acting like a 15,000 people firm sometimes), management not always aligned with each other, silos in work approach despite strides to (en)force collaboration."
"144","company hierarchy, bureaucracy, most developers will need to do Saturday testing and support. working with offshore teaming is not efficient."
"145","Work can be overwhelming. They hire interns so that they don't have to pay full time employees."
"146","Cubicles, god I hate cubicles"
"147","The company feels complacent. It is a monopoly basically in the futures industry. Very little drive to streamline or improve processes. Virtually no communication between departments. Little advancement opportunity, management is old and entrenched. Days become boring for lack of work. Only good for those without real ambition. Actively discourages ambition and dynamism."
"148","Trust some of your employees a bit more"
"149","Most kinds of in-depth training that cost money were no longer funded (but still does offer tuition refund program for accredited degree-seeking programs). Got laid off. Work/life balance ultimately just empty words with continual cost-cutting measures, new ways we were supposed to be more efficient/productive, off-shoring, and applications still in production that we were no longer supposed to support - were we... just supposed to ""just say No""?"
"150","Some departments are still a bit old when looking at average age, which could cause some issues with vision and efficiency."
"151","no benefits i.e. health insur., paid vacation, retirement account- must self fund all of the above....no guarantee you will make money, high possibility to lose money...requires excellent risk management skills and ability to operate effectively in high stress environment"
"152","Difficult bottom-line business decisions to deal with. Some bureaucratic problems."
"153","The Market Regulation Department is mired in bureaucracy and always in transition mode. Most CME Department's show little or no appreciation for good work or anyone who falls below the Managing Director level.."
"154","Senior management are business people. Many of the IT senior managers are taking themselves too serious, maybe it is because most of the time they are surrounded by people more capable."
"155","There are too many politics in the company.   No collaboration,  communication,  critical thinking, and creativity,   which is so important to software evolution.    The environment is very hostile to change,  to new innovative idea."
"156","A lot of really valuable employees seem to leave."
"157","Dont see any as of now"
"158","In a financially well year, the company laid off many talented people. Scary to think what might happen in a down year.

Promotions are very difficult. Don't expect only hard work to get you there. The most successful promotion strategy is to threaten to quit."
"159","Everyone is busy during market hours 
Can't ask too many questions"
"160","Used to be a friendly, welcoming and helpful atmosphere that made people happy to come to work. After numerous layoffs and corporate changes, employee morale is so bad that a day at the office is like being at a funeral all day. 
- no formal job description
- no clear growth paths for promotions - promotions seem to go to ""buddies""
- costs and expenses are under heavy scrutiny - reimbursement for travel, internet..., stipends, overtime, bonuses etc
The mindset seems to be that everyone is operating in survival mode trying to avoid being fired."
"161","none"
"162","Could increase the employee experience through regular engagements."
"163","Lack of clear work priorities; sometimes feels like there are too many managers and architects and not enough hands-on ""do-ers"".  Increased regulation has also increased process and bureaucracy.  This is to be expected, but it seems like some teams in the technology division have gone overboard and a software developer has to deal with a lot of red tape to get work done."
"164","lacks diversity. in a nutshell you will work long hours and it will jeopardize your social life. 
You will have no time to have a break during the day  because markets move really fast"
"165","Quality of  upper management is unstable. High pressure and lot's of overtime."
"166","Way too many managers and legacy employees not qualified for the positions they are in."
"167","Seems like it has really gone downhill recently. Basically no respect for technology staff in the company and near constant reorganizations. Management has some long term plans but it isn't clear on how they will affect individuals especially in technology."
"168","It will take over your life. Work is piled on and no one cares."
"169","Inexpierienced help,lack of organizational mngmnt."
"170","Hands-on IT staff spread extremely thin and over-tasked. Leadership in Enterprise Architecture and Information Security are perhaps not up for the requirements of running a global exchange within the construct of a heavily-regulated environment."
"171","No growth.  Don't think hard work only gets you promotions.  Lay off when market was good so think about bad days."
"172","Losing a lot of talented people locally to offshore headcount as of late due to trying to size the company to remain competitive in a global market."
"173","The CME has ventured into a number of partnerships which have resulted in limited benefits to the company.  They would be better served if they focused on serving markets directly instead of partnering with other exchanges."
"174","not full 40 hour work week so checks seemed short"
"175","over time the monthly paycheck deductions increased -- not nearly as much for single coverage, but family coverage got more costly."
"176","Highly siloed and bureaucratic organization. All projects seem to go over schedule. When work falls between different teams there is often confusion and disagreement as to who is supposed to own the work. Tuition reimbursement benefits were reduced."
"177","Difficult for some to navigate the organization"
"178","- Too much process, gets in the way of doing what' s best for the customer
- Not enough training
- lack of accountability
- lack of a strong career path

"181","in every company there are cons"
"182","Where do I start....Let me first say that I left the company voluntarily.  I was not laid off during the restructuring.  I hold no grudges and I'm grateful to have been part of a great institution for so many years.....but I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't state the unfortunate negatives that have come from CME since 2013.  That was the year of the first IT re-org.  They put someone in charge of... Infrastructure that has a shiny resume, but no actual leadership skills and plagiarizes his communications.  Executive and middle management have been replaced with brash people from Citadel in overtly nepotistic ways.  Citadel is known for overly high expectations of their employees and practice decimation techniques.  The difference being is the prop firms like Citadel pay way more than CME does and only expect to retain you for 2 years.  It doesn't work for an exchange.  

I still keep in touch with old co-workers and the morale is worse every day.  They keep restructuring (firing) and plan to outsource anything they can to India.  People are fleeing this company.  If you want stability and a reasonable 45-50 hour work week don't expect it from this company.  You might as well work for a proprietary trading firm and make 20-40% more with the same level of stress, lack of work-life balance, but more money and better benefits."
"183","Co workers can be a little hard headed.  Some coworkers are too smart to listen to there peers."
"184","Still evolving from a privately owned to a public traded company, highly political, human resources have no idea what they are doing, very very bad travel policy for a company that has over 50% profit margins (all employees required to stay at Club Quarters)"
"185","limited benefits form the job"
"186","If you work in Development team, you should expect to follow standard change management process, a single change to production code or config will mandate new change control ticket, no matter how minor the change is. A good developer usually will get burned out by convoluted change management steps that required. DBA, network (for firewall changes), production support all mandate their own change ticket before their... team will execute any change to production systems. I have seen talented developer left because they get tired of all change control paperwork they had to submit."

"192","Value longtime employees."
"193","The company was a great place to work at before 2009,. Once new management came in they started to do mass layoffs. Laid off  key employees that were responsible for high end systems and proprietary systems creating huge gaps. The new management is not aware of what the person that was let go was responsible for. Seems to be interested in the bottom dollar or what salaries were being made."

"198","long hours, no bonus, out of state work"
"199","Just one thing that worries me is they are the last exchange company to have a true monopoly on trade execution, clearing and market data in one silo. Reminds me of where the CBOE was in 1999 or where AT&T was in the last 70's."

"210","The epitome of corporate America. CME used to be a not-for-profit member owned company. They went public, their stock rose to over $600, they bought every other futures exchange in America (except for ICE) and then they forgot their core values. Loyalty went out the window. Employees with 10, 20, 30+ years of service were fired. They became loyal only to their shareholders, which is what you expect for a public... company. So, if you are prepared to play the game, play it here but watch your back. Nobody else will."
"211","Constant shift in priorities. Employees are challenged to do more with less. Sometimes goals are not realistic, causing more stress and chaos."
"212","There is nothing to mention as Cons that I can say when I was there as an Intern during summer."
"213","The executive management is trying to change the company culture & mindset. However, many of the forward thinking, newer employees, early in their career at CME have to report to middle managers that are stuck in the 1980's. There is a you are welcome for working here attitude,  new ideas are met with contempt. Flexible working arrangements that tech. companies offer are out of the question. These are direct quotes:... ""I'm too old to change."" "" I'm riding the CME gravy train""."

They are always sating that the company wants a work/life balance but this is not reality"
"221","too many contractors because they are trying to cut cost. CME has very high turnover rate, complicated management."
"222","Honestly none to think about"
"223","Questionable direction of the company with the offshoring of resources. CME may be shooting itself in the foot as they offload more and more of their experienced US-based employees.  Over the past 12 months we've seen a huge reduction in personnel but the workload remains the same -- or heavier.  That may look great on paper to the shareholders (in fact our stock price goes up after each series of layoffs) and that... we appear more efficient, but it's at the cost of more work and less life in terms work-life balance. In the long run, it's not sustainable, even with the India branch coming up to speed (by end of 2016)."
"224","Have lower level management communicate more frequently regarding the overall strategy. Follow through on your speak up policy. Lack of career path for non management."

"229","Used to be a cool place brimming with energetic and capable people.  Now people do the bare minimum to not get fired.   A lot of folks don't even care and want the axe provided they get a package.  Morale at an all time low.  

Politics rule here.  Lot of folks advance by whisper campaigning (bad mouthing) their internal competition or by playing golf with management.   Or just by saying yes.  

PMO a joke.  Top... guys have a stunning lack of vision and leadership skills.  Hire yes men and hope for the best.  Shocked many still work at the company.  Detractors or folks who voice an alternate view are let go or demoted.  Losing best talent and not recognizing good talent is common practice for missed opportunities.  Many legacy exec directors are holdovers that wouldn't be marketable anywhere else.  Lack of focus on business process gives it that 90s feel where emails and outdated spreadsheets run amok.  Many unhappy folks in leadership affects productivity.  What happened?  

And now offshoring most of IT and eventually Operations?   Good move (sic).  That'll keep talent here.  This last Strategy scheme will undo a lot of good built by rank and file that put the CME where it is.   And will impact quality.  Oh yeah quality  ... forget it.  The argument is that we can outsource for $25/hr so do it twice and we're still ahead.  

Ask for a profile of recent hires vs recent departures.  Any noticeable trends?   Seriously."
"230","Ok place to work- very siloed and not much opportunity across groups

"231","Easy to start as a consultant, but very hard to transform into a full-time."
"232","Still quite a bit of decisions made based on politics.  Recent cuts have proved to be problematic in some areas as they have replaced people with processes which has resulted in longer lag times and black holes."

Supportive culture has been damaged in recent re-org/layoffs, no one is very happy and the future is unsure"

"240","80% of the work is done by 20% of the staff. Very difficult to get promoted, priorities shift daily, long term strategic planning next to impossible, and many highly paid / highly titled employees in the technology planning area don't pull their own weight. Working hours very stressful. 6-day work weeks are common."
"241","If you consult there very little hope of  actually getting hired full time. Company has been having massive layoffs and doesn't seem to have a great future outlook."
"242","People in charge, over bloated board"
"243","Can improve employee on-boarding and off-boarding"
"244","Poor Management and managers in certain groups, mostly yes men to mgmt, no structure or organization or career path/training, favoritism among certain teams and managers, reduction to tuition reimbursement program recently, MASSIVE EXPENSE REDUCTION PROGRAMS and LAYOFFS.  Not like it used to be and getting worse..."
"245","Unless you were born here, you won't ever get the chance- company has a less than 2% attrition rate and recruiters are proud of the fact that less than 7% of all hires last year came from outside the company."

"253","Inability to get promoted in recent years
A very political and caustic atmosphere 
Flattened org recently has reduced the ability to take on more
Nearly impossible to make decisions and make impacting changes even at Exec Dir level and sometimes even at Sr MD
Because of all of this, many good people have left the company and other good candidates are staying away"
"254","lots of cost cutting and more to come, waiting is a requirement on every project, very few people have a true voice that management will listen to. 
the company is rife with politically savvy people, those that play it will or buddy up to the bosses get ahead, the rest have no hope, laterals are nearly impossible you have to already know how to do the new job and be a perfect match on paper."
"255","My group was understaffed though which lead to issues.  While not afraid to spend money on technology they don't always spend money to get more people to help support it."
"256","company is too focused on cutting costs at the biggest expense of people. everything is going electronic. losing that personal feel that made the markets work."
"257","People aren't promoted on their skills or the fact that they have developed as an employee. When staff are ready for promotion a lot of them are not promoted because there's 'no room in the business'. It's got absolutely nothing to do with their skill at all."
"258","Business is not what it used to be. Unfortunately the economy led to the major collapse of this industry. Too bad, because there was so much potential."
"259","After the last couple reorgs the company has basically turned into ""do as I say"". Opinions, individual thoughts, and alternative solutions are no longer welcome at CME. It's a shame a company that promoted and thrived on innovation has completely thrown that out the window. Every single person I know fears for their job. It's not a healthy place to work."
"260","Management is very Chicago centric and many in positions they should not hold. This company is relatively ""new"" and needs a clean out from the top down."
"261","Management is disconnected to their destruction and downfall of this once great, 100+ year old institution. Some one's pride was hurt when a shoe-in Asian deal didn't go to the CME as expected and CME's downfall began.  They are 12 years too late to the outsourcing game, hiding it as another CME office and will fail miserably!"
"262","After several rounds of layoffs a lot of good (qualified and knowledgeable) people were either let go or quit which created a complete vacuum and crisis of leadership in many groups. Individuals who took their places are utterly incompetent and consequently extremely insecure and seemingly in constant fear for their own jobs.  Middle management is full of incompetent yes-men who are bent on creating appearance of... being extremely busy and pressuring their employees to work on meaningless tasks while setting unreasonable expectations and ridiculous deadlines."
"263","excessive politics at a senior management level which can be disruptive to finish a project with high quality, this impacts which projects/ products are chosen to spend resources on"
"264","After two rounds of lay-offs, removal of naysayers, the organization has been left with an out of touch upper management supported by a middle management layer paranoid about its future in context evaporating opportunities.  

The other recent reviews speak to this reality, no communication, no career progression, middle-management comprised of screaming alcoholics, etc.  The once interesting opportunities are... drying up quickly as the company has focused on “organic” growth and switched to cost-cutting and maintenance mode.    It boggles the mind watching such a profitable company drive itself into the ground.  The company maintains a cash balance of 1.8 billion dollars, margins of an incredible 61%, almost all of which is returned as a dividend to shareholders and barely a dime is reinvested in any sort of innovation.   But why?! Do Google and Apple pay all earnings out as dividends and not re-invest to innovate? Would their shareholders like all cash returned as a dividend, I think not.    Last time I checked, CME wasn’t a utility company, so what gives? 

This “organic growth”(a euphemism for 0 re-investment) focus has left what remains in the middle-management layer scrambling to justify its existence in an ever shrinking pool of opportunity beyond business as usual work.  The doer level employees are left with the scraps, despite having more to offer, while the management put themselves in front of meetings scrambling to drink from the ever drying well of opportunity, desperate to keep their spot.   Ground level employees are left doing monotonous tasks and have no meaningful involvement, no opportunity, zero progression.  

The resulting environment is one of resentment, indignation, boredom, and apathy among staff, and massive career insecurities at the middle manager level.   Survival for the management layer is priority 1 and this only brings out the absolute worst in people, translating to back-stabbing, petty politics, abysmal management, no career development, lacking communication, and flagging employee morale.  

Meanwhile over at the ED/MD/Sr MD rainbow unicorn palace in the sky, things couldn’t be better!  Their middle management yes-men reports do what they’re told, never complain, and deliver their ever shrinking workloads with a smile.  For the executives in the high castle, costs are being cut, profits are flying in(thanks macro-economic environment!), a reducing workload is being delivered, nobody is complaining, and bonus checks couldn’t be better, all of their efforts are a resounding success!  Or are they?  And what about those Engagement Survey results?  What Engagement Survey results, Engagement Sur? Engage-a-what?  Never heard of it.   Career development?  Oh yeah, just go to that online tool thingy and fill it in, yeah it’s real real important guys, we care."

"268","Ever since I left CME, I keep hearing how bad things have become. You lost key people. Many of the ones that remain are NOT blind and are looking."
"269","Working for a company that eliminated hundreds of US jobs in the past 2 years.  Some of the most talented and respected leaders were kicked to the curb with absolutely no reasoning behind it.  Watching these jobs move to Belfast and India has destroyed moral.  The remaining IT leadership is made up of people with ties to India, screaming alcoholics and yes-men.  Existing staff is actively looking for alternative... employment but won't make the move until the next round of layoffs come around (with package) or the next bonus is paid out."
"270","Can be dysfunctional as a work environment"
"271","Worked as Intern awaiting for the full time oppurtunity ."
"272","Company tries to give an image that it is changing, which would be greatly needed to gain in agility and effectiveness, the they change the base and not the leadership. They kept the same senior management which spend its time building their mini empire, focused on their personal gain rather than the company and their team without incentive to take risk to change and improve efficiency and effectiveness...... Promotions and growth is still driven by the size of your organization and therefore stacking people without value creation...."
"273","No standard followed in promotions, some teams promotions are very common while others you are stuck in same position for years and finally end up leaving. You can never compare two people in the same title here, 

money saving is the primary goal these days and can see a great company loosing its shine. This company used to be in best 100 companies for years. I cant think this is going to happen in the... future

middle management keeps changing and new managers have no idea what kind of work their employees are doing.

work life balance is mostly in paper, also varies with managers even in same department."
"274","Upward advancement can be tough depending on where you are in the company, along with dealing with lots of politics and cliques amongst divisions and colleagues. Some people's behavior reminded me of high school. If you can avoid the drama as much as possible, your day will flow much smoother."
"275","I can't really talk about downsides at my level, however, it seemed the company was quick to fire their upper-level management without much notice. Very Wolf on Wall Street."

"277","Too much politics to go up any higher. 
On my first day at this company, I asked one of my new colleagues, what his role was and he sarcastically replied, ""I don't do anything"". I found out eventually that he really didn't do anything. His answer was truer than he even realized.
Rewards are based on how close you are to the management folks. Reward hard-working dev folks as well."
"278","Very high stressed, Saturday working, new Org structure is not doing well."
"279","As for cuts are made in preparation of the India Data Center that will ramp up late 2016, the workload increases and leads to burnout.  A lot of middle managers are still there that do not know the business nor are they technical, but know enough to sound knowledgeable in meetings and fool senior management.  They are only worried about themselves."
"280","Layoffs are frequent and the loss of good people in both upper management and worker bees is demoralizing. Whats left in its place is the feeling of uncertainty and no direction.
Management does not promote career growth. Prepare for absolutely no lateral movement for your tenure at CME."

"348","Hiring and other HR policies are clumsy. Not very quality oriented and processes are not standardized. Office politics prevelant due to higher salaries compared to capabilities. Fixed office timings. More like a bpo/support centre than a development centre. Outdated technology and not much to learn. Little bit bossy culture by directors on floor. Some groupism and nepotism can be seen as lot of senior people joined... from one company through each other's contacts. Others who join without much contact internally often face the heat. Overall ok - nothing great. People from other banking captives like jp morgan etc are considered superior than those who join from service companies regardless of individual skills and capabilities. HR processes not transparent. One colleage who resigned had to face lot of issues in getting relieving letter on time."

Many references is taken from consultancy who may be paying off to recruitment team."

Constant turnover, over 13 last year left

This department is very toxic, highly corporate with the examiners/auditors constantly quitting and management doesn't seem to care, they just get someone else out of school to underpay and take their place.

"400","Cube monkey, look at excel all day, very bureaucratic, not a lot of opportunity to advance into a different role"
"401","Lots of favoritism, especially towards remote Belfast and India offices, and frustrating organizational politics. Additionally, there isn’t any transparency from upper management on how decisions are made or if there’s any data to back those decisions. These points, as well as all the “security” related policies, which just end up wrapping everything in red tape, ultimately drove my decision to leave.
Also, there... exists in CME a know-it-all culture among senior management, where they seem to bury their heads in the sand in regards to pain points and the insane bureaucracy. This attitude of “everything is great and we have no problems” results in nothing changing and all these pain points only becoming more and more painful. 
Another huge frustration is the “throw some stuff at the wall and hope it sticks” mindset, with zero accountability when projects fail and it doesn’t “stick” (and usually it doesn’t).

From a technology perspective, lots of talk about “innovation” and “hiring the best” but that’s mostly just talk. The tech stack is a quite boring in most teams, with a few exceptions. In fact, when it comes to tech, the company is really just playing catch up at a brutally slow pace (mainly due to extreme red tape brought on by “security” measures, many of which are excessive and have nothing to due with real security).
From a hiring perspective, the technologists that are hired tend to be picked based on either industry experience or just the gut feeling of someone with a big shot title, and rarely on the applicant’s actual technical skill. Too many hiring decisions are made from the top down."

Prepare for ' world-class' bureaucracy and 'industry-leading' politics. You'd be lucky if you have a boss who understands your work and cares about you, and the chance of so is decreasing as these people are leaving. Your boss is most likely only pretending to be knowledgeable to... backup his/her micro-management, and has no interest in recognizing who're the actual performers among the astonishing number of free riders who probably are better paid than you.   He cares about his next promotion even it means cutting promising projects. You and your boss aren't the same team, you are two professionals who takes care of your own career.

All Job Descriptions in the job market are somewhat painted but here it can get extreme. Hiring Masters from Ivy-like schools and leaving them with literally no intellectually challenging work is not uncommon.  This company can afford. Years later real talents either leave or can no longer find jobs matching their current rank &  salary elsewhere because in other places you actually need to Do things. If your boss comes from the later group then re-consider your career when you still can"
