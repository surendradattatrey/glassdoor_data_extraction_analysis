Prepare for ' world-class' bureaucracy and 'industry-leading' politics.

Your boss is most likely only pretending to be knowledgeable to... backup his/her micro-management, and has no interest in recognizing who're the actual performers among the astonishing number of free riders who probably are better paid than you.   He cares about his next promotion even it means cutting promising projects. You and your boss aren't the same team, you are two professionals who takes care of your own career.

All Job Descriptions in the job market are somewhat painted but here it can get extreme. Hiring Masters from Ivy-like schools and leaving them with literally no intellectually challenging work is not uncommon.  This company can afford.

"157","Lots of favoritism, especially towards remote Belfast and India offices, and frustrating organizational politics. Additionally, there isn’t any transparency from upper management on how decisions are made or if there’s any data to back those decisions. These points, as well as all the “security” related policies, which just end up wrapping everything in red tape, ultimately drove my decision to leave.
Also, there... exists in CME a know-it-all culture among senior management, where they seem to bury their heads in the sand in regards to pain points and the insane bureaucracy. This attitude of “everything is great and we have no problems” results in nothing changing and all these pain points only becoming more and more painful. 
Another huge frustration is the “throw some stuff at the wall and hope it sticks” mindset, with zero accountability when projects fail and it doesn’t “stick” (and usually it doesn’t).

From a technology perspective, lots of talk about “innovation” and “hiring the best” but that’s mostly just talk. The tech stack is a quite boring in most teams, with a few exceptions. In fact, when it comes to tech, the company is really just playing catch up at a brutally slow pace (mainly due to extreme red tape brought on by “security” measures, many of which are excessive and have nothing to due with real security).
From a hiring perspective, the technologists that are hired tend to be picked based on either industry experience or just the gut feeling of someone with a big shot title, and rarely on the applicant’s actual technical skill. Too many hiring decisions are made from the top down."
"158","First, advice to one looking to possibly join the company - CME is a good place to work if all you want is a job where you can chill, do very little work, and receive a paycheck plus a pension. Depending on which team you’re on, there really could be room for growth, but if you’re ambitious and looking for a great career where you can boast about how amazing the company culture is and how the whole org operates... smoothly together, and that you are constantly learning new concepts and technologies everyday, look elsewhere. 

Advice to management- you won’t get better unless you acknowledge that problems exist. Honestly look into the engagement survey results and take action where needed, especially regarding bureaucracy, politics, and senior leadership.
Hire slowly, and stop rushing offshore growth. There’s nothing wrong with growing offshore teams, but it should happen gradually. When you rush it (Bangalore..), quality deteriorates and the company could start falling behind.
Also, the company should be growing as a whole both in the US and abroad, not just in the remote offices. In fact, recently it seems the US based offices are really experiencing critical losses when it comes to quality people and leaders. When you see so many great folks running away, you think you‘d realize there might be a few problems. 
Lastly, if you really want to brand yourself as a technology company (those words are thrown around A LOT), stop using other mediocre legacy financial institutions as a baseline, and decide what kind of company CME really wants to become. If it’s just another financial services company, so be it, but if CME really wants to be “cutting edge” and a “tech company” then some real change needs to occur"

Uninspiring and inauthentic senior management more concerned with their golden handcuffs than their people and challenging the status quo.  Bad HR policies that stifle talented mid-level employees.  Toxic, gossip-filled, silo'ed, and territorial culture that deserves its own Uber-style exposure.  Splashy efforts at ""innovation,"" but when's the last... time CME made real profit on a new business?

Fun tip: look at the tone-deaf propaganda responses from HR on these Glassdoor reviews that politely deny that any problems exist, often with a line like ""that's not the environment we recognize!"" and a reference to an engagement survey that's taken every two years.  For example, they say that their education reimbursement is twice the industry average! Wow! But they fail to mention it used to be 100% covered. People joined specifically for this benefit, before it was ripped away with no warning, causing major life disruptions.

"175","Take a careful look at your senior ranks.  Very few of them have the skills to inspire confidence or motivate teams.

"180","The CME makes a huge amount of profit through what appear to be monopolies on certain marketplaces. These keep ticking over without the need for much innovation.

Over time I think this has led to a gradual accumulation of ineffective managers and incompetent support staff who would have otherwise have been moved on.

There is bad behavior - backchanneling and sabotage - at some of the highest levels of leadership. Employees are rewarded more for time in role than performance, so if you value promotion due to performance, you might find this environment challenging. Investments are spread too thin across too many priorities,... making it hard to see/feel like there is progress."

"200","Bangalore is the only office which is growing. Employees are slowly being let go from NYC office. This is being done one or two at a time to keep it under the radar. All the values and principles of the firm are only on paper. In practice there is rampant corruption (especially in technology vendors), favoritism and red tape.  Dissenting viewpoints though encouraged in training and meetings are your way out of the... firm in practice.

People should not be promoted into management just because of a history technical skills; if you do not have people skills or are lazy, you should probably not be in management."

They preach about wanting leaders but by leading they really mean following them and spreading their message to others.  Layoffs are annual now and often secretive but everyone always finds out anyway.  The company has been having difficulty growing revenue and so to please... shareholders they lower expenses and salary is a large part of that.

The technology leaders ""vision"" is a joke. Its simply this, outsource everything and let someone else deal with the consequences later. Technology is slowww and ""new"" ideas other companies did 6-10... years ago. No way to get ahead unless you are great at pretending these guys are awesome or you grew up in India. Women and minorities are basically nonexistent in IT at manager levels and above. Wouldn't have brought it up but They consistently talk diversity but that's just to pretend it exists"
"251","None, they know everything so they don't care anyway. HR sends surveys to only a subset of employees now, stop pretending it's getting better by hand picking who you get feedback from. The results were awful since 2014. Stop pretending and sending fake happy notes."
"252","you indirectly work for CFTC and there is no room for creativity"
"253","Hiring and other HR policies are clumsy. Not very quality oriented and processes are not standardized. Office politics prevelant due to higher salaries compared to capabilities. Fixed office timings. More like a bpo/support centre than a development centre. Outdated technology and not much to learn. Little bit bossy culture by directors on floor. Some groupism and nepotism can be seen as lot of senior people joined... from one company through each other's contacts. Others who join without much contact internally often face the heat. Overall ok - nothing great. People from other banking captives like jp morgan etc are considered superior than those who join from service companies regardless of individual skills and capabilities. HR processes not transparent. One colleage who resigned had to face lot of issues in getting relieving letter on time."
"254","None"
"255","Nothing to learn technically. outdated technologies. No career growth. Immature HR processes. Strict timings. Not very open culture. Director is god. Managers don't have much autonomy. Good for 1-1.5 years to increase your salary. Not good for a long term stint. Hiring process is not good. So lot of reshuffling and layoffs. High work pressure."
"256","New York is cold in winter."
"257","Lethargic process. Specifically at Bangalore office we see recruitment team doesn't even call the candidates we refer. Lots of emphasis is given to referral but something is fishy with Bangalore recruitment team. Many employees believe there is some internal dealing with few consultancy and recruitment team. Many references is taken from consultancy who may be paying off to recruitment team."
"258","Management and international recruitment please do some audits if they really use the referral options wisely."
"259","Toxic department

Constant turnover, over 13 last year left

This department is very toxic, highly corporate with the examiners/auditors constantly quitting and management doesn't seem to care, they just get someone else out of school to underpay and take their place.

Highly clicky and gossipy and immature

They are beholden to their shareholders and will put that above anything.  

As I saw in someone... else's recent review their is one director that is very mean and has made people cry and some quit.

I had to do a variety of things not in my job description, not even close to what is reasonable

My coworker was picked on and pushed out because people didn't seem to like her even though she was nice just didn't fit in to their ideals.  And was in a group that did not want her to succeed

No flexibility in work hours or time off to go to appointments (unless your management)

"264","Convert consultants to full time employees"
"265","Company/management seems to value industry knowledge versus competency.  Few folks are held accountable to actually get things done and when initiatives fail, which they often times do, the leaders who were on the hook to deliver are given  more responsibility and get to fail on even larger initiatives. If this company had to actually work to make money they would be out of business quickly."
"266","Unlikely that they would listen as they think they know it all."
"267","Off-shoring of jobs. Endless bureaucracy and meetings. Security concerns make everything painful. Spend more time configuring files than writing actual code."
"268","Management is constantly changing course."
"269","It's the most politically charged company I've ever worked at. There are employees on visas, desperate for green card sponsorship. It results in a lack of teamwork and some backstabbing, as they push to look better than their peers.  

Morale has been low, and now bonuses were lower than expected even with record volumes, due to their ""forecasted budget"" having unreasonably high expectations."
"270","Don't treat your employees as easily replaceable. Limit offshoring.  Encourage managers to value teamwork and to care about team morale. The current sweatshop mentality comes from their desire for bigger bonuses at the cost of their staff."
"271","Political, way to much red tape."
"272","could pay more than competitiors"
"273","pay more"
"274","Very Chicago-centric but getting better as this company becomes more global."

"276","You need to ask for something if you want it; don't just assume management knows what you need to be successful."
"277","Can be very hierarchical and title-driven"
"278","There aren't a lot of cons.  Salary is comparable to most companies.  I would say they are about average...  They do offer equity and a bonus which is a major plus!"
"279","Quality of upper management is questionable.
Senior managment place too much emphais on the 'pub' and not enough on project deliverables.
If you enjoy the pub culture this is a good place for you to work.  If you don't enjoy it you won't fit in.
Many staff feel the management are just there for the salary and this is quite demoralising.
It's become a very difficult and political place to work
Not enough... decision making
Back stabbing culture
Constant layoffs
Staff always complain about being bored, and working on the same or similar projects - ground hog day
Noticeable lack of ethnic diversity in the office!"
"280","Should  place as much attention and care into your staff as you do for your enthusiam to go to the pub.  There are some excellent and very capable individuals in the company who feel overlooked and demoralised, and would leave tommorrow if it was not for the need of a stable salary."
"281","Full of old-timers and some of them hardly do any work; double standard in the promotion ranks across departments meaning that some people can just skip ranks because they know the right people."
"282","Very political. Frequent senior management changes. Poor morale. Difficult to move around."
"283","Nothing I am aware of."

"293","The new management has taken out all the seasoned employees.  I thought I would retire from that company."
"294","Realize the talent you have."
"295","sometimes boring work. There is little communication between colleagues."
"296","Career paths depend on the department.  Some are very straightforward where others are non existent.  Most people either move to another department or leave the company to progress."
"297","I don't have any cons for CME Group depending on my experience in CME Group."
"298","There is a bizarre secrecy within the Investigations department, no one seems to trust each other. More importantly though, much of the work is unchallenging and easily automated. Very high turnover from people leaving to do the same work for more money at other regulatory agencies, and those that stay becoming the middle management because of seniority. Little effort from top management to help control for culture... which is important with so much turnover."
"299","Spend a bit more time sorting out the culture, and allow people to do their own work"
"300","Boring job. Need to teach interns more and teach them more. Need better training program."
"301","Low pay
Intern work often monotonous data entry
Lax of flexibility with students"
"302","I was hoping to find some +'s unfortunately not many except that the interview process is super easy to get your foot into the door. 
Department is living in OLD SCHOOL leadership methodology where a few bad apples run the entire department and ultimately your career growth and progress. 
Department needs to look and learn from other departments within CME Group, Inc. and truly adhere to and live by the company... objectives of Focusing on Career and Professional Development of its workforce. Rather the department just cares about the few individuals and hopes the rest follow suit."
"303","Learn to lead like other leaders in the organization. Teach new seniors to not just learn their job but also focus on leading and teaching the processes to new employees."
"304","I didn't come across any cons."

"306","Sometimes there seems to be a lack of direction, even for the higher ups."
"307","Bureaucracy in some kind of way"
"308","Downsizing, offshoring, and forced retirement packages."
"309","Don't forget your employees are one of your most valuable assets"
"310","Lack of professional risk management (or any kind of management) systems, promotions are not based on performance but on ""change in scope of work"" so no reward for doing a good job but promotes nepotism & backstabbing."
"311","Change management from board, C-suite down, a tree cannot stand if the roots are rotten"
"312","I don't have any bad impression on CME. Highly regulated company sometimes lack of flexibility is understandable."
"313","The authorization would be more efficient"

"329","Sometimes can be difficult to get things done because of too many management layers"
"330","very corporate culture, cubicles etc."
"331","Management tends to focus on corporate more than the New York location. Promotions are far and few. Career delopment is half sighted especially in New York Ofice. The New York office finds out last about any initiatives. Feel disconnected from corporate most of the time. The communication is just bad from corporate to other locations. Employees are not valued."
"332","Need to focus on all locations and not just Corporate. Need to dedicate more time with staff and career development. Need to promote more staff outside of corporate."
"333","Old, sub-par exchange technology, some departments are more team-based than others. Lack of strong culture and younger employees if those are something you're looking for."

Interfering and unhelpful HR. They have their own agenda, protect the company and their jobs and don't help staff"

opportunities for advancement on the trading floor."
"346","No room for growth. Small niche."
"347","There have been a lot of changes in the past couple of years that indicate that employees are no longer valued. The politics, red tape, and low morale have created a very negative environment to work in and senior management either is not aware or does not care."
"348","Look below and see how the handling of these changes have affected your staff. None of the changes were handled well. Communication is at an all time low and it behooves the firm to work on increasing morale."
"349","Leadership is gone
Quality people are gone
0 investment in educated experienced loyal employees , cut cut cut expenses and move move move to India.

Stay away, it is a sinking boat, although too big to fail."
"350","CME used to be a great place to work, to learn, to meat high quality people.

"363","Reduced tuition reimbursement assistance; not flexible work schedule depending on your team."
"364","As for cuts are made in preparation of the India Data Center that will ramp up late 2016, the workload increases and leads to burnout.  A lot of middle managers are still there that do not know the business nor are they technical, but know enough to sound knowledgeable in meetings and fool senior management.  They are only worried about themselves."
"365","Bring in someone from the outside to review the structure and determine what fat must be trimmed."
"366","Layoffs are frequent and the loss of good people in both upper management and worker bees is demoralizing. Whats left in its place is the feeling of uncertainty and no direction.
Management does not promote career growth. Prepare for absolutely no lateral movement for your tenure at CME."
"367","People are better than their current position. Promote career growth and opportunity."
"368","Disorganized environment! I waited until 2:00 pm for my computer was set up. I do not recommend this place, there are too many people there who do not welcome new people if you are not part of their clique. People there have no patience for explaining things or training, try to learn on your own. If you ask a question you'll be regarded as stupid, inexperienced or annoying."
"369","Nothing I can think of or I encountered during my short stay"
"370","Very political. There are more directors than analysts in this company and they all demand the same analyst to do all the works."
"371","Cut the manager and director counts. Have more people who will actually do work, not attending endless meetings."
"372","- Lack of leadership / strategic direction - everything is a top priority until it is forgotten about

- Company is feeling the employee backlash from lay offs and has left remaining staff unmotivated,... demoralized, or looking for new opportunities elsewhere
- Outsourcing work to remote consultants / Hiring H1-B workers is current staff augmentation strategy
- Managers receive little to no formal training and ""wing it"" with their direct reports
- Communication from management is non-existent (unless you consider plagiarized HBR articles)

"381","Worked as Intern awaiting for the full time oppurtunity ."
"382","Company tries to give an image that it is changing, which would be greatly needed to gain in agility and effectiveness, the they change the base and not the leadership. They kept the same senior management which spend its time building their mini empire, focused on their personal gain rather than the company and their team without incentive to take risk to change and improve efficiency and effectiveness...... Promotions and growth is still driven by the size of your organization and therefore stacking people without value creation...."

"384","No standard followed in promotions, some teams promotions are very common while others you are stuck in same position for years and finally end up leaving. You can never compare two people in the same title here, 

money saving is the primary goal these days and can see a great company loosing its shine. This company used to be in best 100 companies for years. I cant think this is going to happen in the... future

"385","whatever is done with promotions process made it worse. Not seeing merit based promotions any more here."
"386","Upward advancement can be tough depending on where you are in the company, along with dealing with lots of politics and cliques amongst divisions and colleagues. Some people's behavior reminded me of high school. If you can avoid the drama as much as possible, your day will flow much smoother."

On my first day at this company, I asked one of my new colleagues, what his role was and he sarcastically replied, ""I don't do anything"". I found out eventually that he really didn't do anything. His answer was truer than he even realized.
Rewards are based on how close you are to the management folks. Reward hard-working dev folks as well."

"396","Stop trying to please your old school share holders and clean out your mid level management."
"397","Management is disconnected to their destruction and downfall of this once great, 100+ year old institution. Some one's pride was hurt when a shoe-in Asian deal didn't go to the CME as expected and CME's downfall began.  They are 12 years too late to the outsourcing game, hiding it as another CME office and will fail miserably!"

If that's not a lawsuit..."
"399","After several rounds of layoffs a lot of good (qualified and knowledgeable) people were either let go or quit which created a complete vacuum and crisis of leadership in many groups. Individuals who took their places are utterly incompetent and consequently extremely insecure and seemingly in constant fear for their own jobs.  Middle management is full of incompetent yes-men who are bent on creating appearance of... being extremely busy and pressuring their employees to work on meaningless tasks while setting unreasonable expectations and ridiculous deadlines."
"400","Do a better job putting right people into right positions. Select qualified/capable employees to lead rather than convenient slaves that would agree with anything and have absolutely no opinion of their own no matter what the truth is.

"401","excessive politics at a senior management level which can be disruptive to finish a project with high quality, this impacts which projects/ products are chosen to spend resources on"
"402","eliminate politics at least up to the middle management layers, focus on a few strong areas and focus on those instead of trying to achieve everything"
"403","After two rounds of lay-offs, removal of naysayers, the organization has been left with an out of touch upper management supported by a middle management layer paranoid about its future in context evaporating opportunities.  

The other recent reviews speak to this reality, no communication, no career progression, middle-management comprised of screaming alcoholics, etc.  The once interesting opportunities are... drying up quickly as the company has focused on “organic” growth and switched to cost-cutting and maintenance mode.    It boggles the mind watching such a profitable company drive itself into the ground.  The company maintains a cash balance of 1.8 billion dollars, margins of an incredible 61%, almost all of which is returned as a dividend to shareholders and barely a dime is reinvested in any sort of innovation.   But why?! Do Google and Apple pay all earnings out as dividends and not re-invest to innovate? Would their shareholders like all cash returned as a dividend, I think not.    Last time I checked, CME wasn’t a utility company, so what gives? 

This “organic growth”(a euphemism for 0 re-investment) focus has left what remains in the middle-management layer scrambling to justify its existence in an ever shrinking pool of opportunity beyond business as usual work.  The doer level employees are left with the scraps, despite having more to offer, while the management put themselves in front of meetings scrambling to drink from the ever drying well of opportunity, desperate to keep their spot.   Ground level employees are left doing monotonous tasks and have no meaningful involvement, no opportunity, zero progression.  

The resulting environment is one of resentment, indignation, boredom, and apathy among staff, and massive career insecurities at the middle manager level.   Survival for the management layer is priority 1 and this only brings out the absolute worst in people, translating to back-stabbing, petty politics, abysmal management, no career development, lacking communication, and flagging employee morale.  

Meanwhile over at the ED/MD/Sr MD rainbow unicorn palace in the sky, things couldn’t be better!  Their middle management yes-men reports do what they’re told, never complain, and deliver their ever shrinking workloads with a smile.  For the executives in the high castle, costs are being cut, profits are flying in(thanks macro-economic environment!), a reducing workload is being delivered, nobody is complaining, and bonus checks couldn’t be better, all of their efforts are a resounding success!  Or are they?  And what about those Engagement Survey results?  What Engagement Survey results, Engagement Sur? Engage-a-what?  Never heard of it.   Career development?  Oh yeah, just go to that online tool thingy and fill it in, yeah it’s real real important guys, we care."

Existing staff is actively looking for alternative... employment but won't make the move until the next round of layoffs come around (with package) or the next bonus is paid out."
"414","You guys blew it.  You had talented employees that had a passion to grow the business and grow professionally.  Not having the respect of your employees is a bad situation to be in.

"464","80% of the work is done by 20% of the staff. Spread the work out. Technology was once a prized department - not any more. Good staff are looking and some have started leaving.

PMO a joke.  Top... guys have a stunning lack of vision and leadership skills.  Hire yes men and hope for the best.  Shocked many still work at the company.  Detractors or folks who voice an alternate view are let go or demoted.  Losing best talent and not recognizing good talent is common practice for missed opportunities.  Many legacy exec directors are holdovers that wouldn't be marketable anywhere else.  Lack of focus on business process gives it that 90s feel where emails and outdated spreadsheets run amok.  Many unhappy folks in leadership affects productivity.  What happened?  

And now offshoring most of IT and eventually Operations?   Good move (sic).  That'll keep talent here.  This last Strategy scheme will undo a lot of good built by rank and file that put the CME where it is.   And will impact quality.  Oh yeah quality  ... forget it.

That may look great on paper to the shareholders (in fact our stock price goes up after each series of layoffs) and that... we appear more efficient, but it's at the cost of more work and less life in terms work-life balance.

They went public, their stock rose to over $600, they bought every other futures exchange in America (except for ICE) and then they forgot their core values. Loyalty went out the window. Employees with 10, 20, 30+ years of service were fired. They became loyal only to their shareholders, which is what you expect for a public... company.

I hold no grudges and I'm grateful to have been part of a great institution for so many years.....but I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't state the unfortunate negatives that have come from CME since 2013.  That was the year of the first IT re-org.  They put someone in charge of... Infrastructure that has a shiny resume, but no actual leadership skills and plagiarizes his communications.  Executive and middle management have been replaced with brash people from Citadel in overtly nepotistic ways.  Citadel is known for overly high expectations of their employees and practice decimation techniques.  The difference being is the prop firms like Citadel pay way more than CME does and only expect to retain you for 2 years.  It doesn't work for an exchange.  

I still keep in touch with old co-workers and the morale is worse every day.  They keep restructuring (firing) and plan to outsource anything they can to India.  People are fleeing this company.  If you want stability and a reasonable 45-50 hour work week don't expect it from this company.

Its obvious that they want to cut more but don't  want to pay the severance checks. Then the grueling hours come and they wait to see who breaks.  Someday this will crash something important. Lots of technical debt being incurred.  Come and learn but don't get lulled by the... music."

Many manual processes that could easily be automated but are not.  Many outdated legacy systems.  Severe risk aversion that inhibits improvements.  Locked-down computers.  Big brother surveillance.  Depressing office environment.  Awful coffee.  Low... expectations for developer productivity."

Poor management decision making (at least in the department I was in) and they don't seem to know what they want employees to do from day to day.  Job description postings are seldom accurate for what you would actually be required to... perform.   Management doesn't like it when an employee out-performs his/her superiors.  Company doesn't really look for people to be innovative...they would prefer employees to be grouped in a box....no movement or reward for ingenuity, creativity, or thinking outside of the box.  Extremely focused on cost savings to the point the company will forego important investments in CRM, reporting tools, and other technologies necessary to carry the company into the next generation of growth.

Also, it's a relatively small company so movement (depending on which department you're in) can be slow or negligible.  Many good employees have left because there's no room to grow upward."
"676","Loosen the grip on the ground employees and encourage entrepreneurship mindsets...allow your employees to maximize their creativity to grow your business.  Stop having management be the ones to lead conversations and engage your younger employees in strategic meetings and executive succession planning initiatives."
"677","Recent layoffs and policy changes were not well thought out.  Laid off very talented, driven professionals with no solid explanation.  Significantly reduced tuition reimbursement program that was key for more junior staff and a differentiator that led to committed, loyal staff.  CEO is known for colorful style, but is often sexist and racist (against anyone that isn't brown) and his use of off colorful language... should not be accepted at a industry-leading, large public company."
"678","Aim before you fire.  The recent layoffs were poorly planned and executed.  
While macro conditions will drive growth, opportunities for outsized growth should be invested in (e.g., international).  
CEO is not a strong leader and hides behind humor to mask inability to inspire, provide focus and lead."

With such great market share and resources on hand, the company needs to take a look at how it does business if it hopes to retain its position in the long term."

"684","Deal with lack of collaboration as this can prevent progress."

"696","They aren't fair to their minority employees. This company is full of office politics. And believe me when I say nepotism is alive and well at the CME!"

"704","A challenging work ethic along with travel requirements"
"705","Retailiation if go 2HR and they will resort to lies to get you fired. Lynching of careers needs to stop."
"706","Because the bias occurs at varying levels of management (Directors, Executive Directors) only the upper echelon levels of management (CEO, CIO) can do anything about this very biased environment. Look at the numbers of different groups of staff members and see what levels they are in. There is a pattern that the manager of a specific racial group are told to give that staff member negative performance feedback,... regardless of if it is deserved or not. This used to be a decent place to work for everyone, but a select group of managers have determined that CME Group had too many members of a certain ethinicity and have taken steps to get rid of them, by any means necessary."

"708","Cut the workforce by 20%."

It isn't CME Group's fault but the intense regulatory environment sometimes forces employees to do work that  adds little value to the process or the organization but is done anyway because a regulator asked for it"
"727","Value your employees.  They talk all the time about how CME Group experience counts but they always hire from the outside because they want the best fit making it very hard to transfer to another division or department."
"728","They do not keep justice, they do not like results.  Its not enough just to be professional at CME."
"729","You should be more attentive and knowledgeable to what is going on with your employees. You should be more professional. The directional persecution is not appropriate."
"730","(1) There are very few competent people working here.  Most of the best staff leave within six months to a year after joining.

(4) Very poor management;  I have never seen it this bad before
(5) There is no culture to speak of; hypocrisy and double talk are the norm of... management
(6) Employees that do not go along with some of these issues are often harasses and retaliated against"
"731","It is time to leave;  get younger more capable people in positions of power to try to reform CME."
"732","There is no work life balance. You are considered to be on call all the time. 
Software development is always rushed to the point that there is rarely any design, certainly no documentation - even in the code. It is all about getting a feature in and released - testing seems to be in production."
"733","Engineers need to be given the time to produce code that represents what they can actually do rather what they can do in the time. The amount of engineering time wasted in reworking or studying undocumented code just to understand it's operation is enormous. It leads to a place where engineers feel pressured to get to the next milestone and the next checkbox rather than to do a good job."
"734","No real hope for career advancement. Incompetent people mostly fill middle management.
Promotions are given to brown nosers. It does not matter how smart you are or how much you contribute.
Low base pay and bonuses.
If you are smart, you won't learn much here. Most of your time will be spent wiping the drool off your managers' faces.
No one really cares for your opinion on anything. Give them a good idea and you... will politely be told to shut up and sit down. You are simply to do what you are told. Do it while praising your manager for coming up with such an innovative solution and maybe you'll get promoted."
"735","The talk about how complacency is a killer is just that - talk! It's only a matter of time before someone takes market share away from you. Consider putting the company up for sale and pray for a private equity group to buy you out and give the cage the rattle it needs so badly. Tons of fat to be cut. The company is a cash cow being milked by people I wouldn't even hire to help my son with his homework, let alone... decide what derivatives products should be launched or how they should be priced. And the technology? Either outdated or incredibly buggy or both! I'm surprised the company is able to function with all that junk."
"736","There is a tendency to defer to the ""this is just how we do things"" type of attitude and there are a lot of inefficiencies that can be difficult to navigate."

It claims to be 'global' but working in its European and Asian outposts soon reveals an inability to see beyond the Midwest.  Too often you hear, ""that's how it's always been done"" and ""We'll have to run that by Chicago for their approval.""  This is inefficient and there is a total lack of insight into how... business is done in other parts of the world.  If you can't be global, you should be  focusing on your core competencies in the US and leave the rest of the world to the companies that understand it (like ICE).  
The implications for employees in non-US offices are significant.  There is a 'them-and-us' dynamic between the US and non-US colleagues; pay and benefits don't reflect the economics of overseas centres; reporting lines to managers are overstretched and inefficient (way too many late-night conference calls because Chicago can't get its head around the timezones); when it comes to performance reviews, managers measure overseas employees against Chicago yardsticks without factoring in the different markets, cultures, etc.  In recent years, huge pressure has been brought to bear on the overseas offices to deliver growth while cutting costs (and jobs); Chicago remains bloated with timewasters working the minimum of hours in a comfortable and complacent environment. Some seem to have been there for way too long and have no dynamism or interest in change. If you're working in Chicago, look forward to 9-5 hours and ample resources; if in an overseas office, it's long hours and way too much stress."

Sometimes it feels like you are assigned more work than you could possibly complete in the time given (isn't that every job though). However, people... and management are usually supportive and understanding of the time needed for the tasks assigned."
"788","Poor peformance of stock price"
"789","N/A"
"790","Some communication lacking between divisions/teams."
"791","Increased cost cutting leading to outsourcing
Top heavy management
24hr on-call support"
"792","Outsourcing is not the answer - leads to poor quality and lower morale as well as lower productivity for those that must manage these resources.  Increase internal opprotunities by giving preference to qualified insiders."
"793","-Senior management is somewhat incompetent at times and some are so arrogant
-There are people who are managers & AD's who are clearly not ready for the role
-Seems to be resentment from older employees to young, bright employees who aspire to move up.
-Work can get repetitive and monotonous at times."
"794","Be more accessible to employees & give fairer promotions and raises (they pick favorites a lot)."
"795","Stress of the job can get to some people. Everyone working on the floor seems to have something to complain about"
"796","lack opportunity for growth, lack of meritocracy"
"797","Can be repetitive but overall serves a purpose.
Not able to encounter or collaborate with high level management.
Average salary."
"798","Work life balance is not met sometimes due to extensive work and Company bonus is not what it was few years ago.  Should relax the work from home policy and bonus structure for higher employee morale."
"799","Management should consider bring more employees due to the number of changes in the industry and the heightened level of scrutiny and competition."
"800","Management should be sure to properly reward and promote its employees who have taken on significant responsibility and have performed at a high level in the ever changing work environment."
"801","first and foremost - salary.  that has always been the number one reason people have left.  but it's not even so much the lower starting salary that upsets people (because remember, they do accept the salary to begin employment there), but rather the fact that NON-MANAGEMENT promotions and raises (other than minimal, across the board cost of living adjustments) are scarce.  this single-handedly destroys morale and... furthers the already massive rift between management and non-management.

people don't expect to be in the same position with more or less the same salary years later after joining the company.  but that is exactly what happens to the vast majority of individuals who work there.  this is all while middle and upper management seemingly promotes itself in an endless circle, creating new positions at random when needed and having far too many in the same title.  they only decide to throw a bone to the people actually doing the work after they have given themselves raises and still have money left.  excuses about there not being enough money for promotions is a joke, especially when you hear the CEO tell us how profitable the business is and how great it is doing and we are still hiring new people.

communication is absolutely horrendous at all levels, and particularly between management and non-mangement.  goals, timelines, etc - many time they are non-existent.  most of the time the communication issues stem from people not being able to articulate what it is they really want.  and many times that is simply due to them not knowing.

employees are given a veil of respect by management, but actions speak louder than words.  if you are praised for a great job and have a glowing performance review, why then is there no promotion and/or raise...time and time again.

favoritism is rampant and is primarily the sole reason for promotion decisions, rather than actual performance.

it is most definitely NOT an environment for generating creative thought.  almost all ideas are promptly stifled, whether they have merit or not."
"802","the management style is archaic.  the rift between management and non-management is vast.  there are far too many queen bees, and in some areas not enough worker bees.

the technology is also very archaic in some parts of the company.  it is almost unbelievable what some systems are running on.  you need to invest capital in the company's infrastructure at a significant level and get it up to speed.  very old... proprietary programs need to be converted.  there are also a great amount of other processes that need to be automated rather than done by hand.  these processes can be checked by employees, but there is no reason people should be doing certain things manually.

as mentioned numerous times already - less cooks in the kitchen.  consolidate management BIG TIME.

IT is critical to this business, as are many departments.  tech staff should be encouraged to continue learning about new products that will help the business and to also further their own learning in any way they can.  the sales team, while important for growth, is not a group of demigods, yet they are treated as such because the company sees them as the ones bringing in the money.

management has failed to create innovative products and has simply copied competitors.  this has put the company's future in jeopardy as they are constantly behind.  the only ""new"" products that have come out have been at the direct request of current or potential clients asking ""do you have this?"" or ""can you make that?""

it costs very little to take a risk on a new product.  so why is the company constantly launching tired, redundant products instead of actually trying something new?"
"803","CME Group had a burst of growth and currently the processes for managing SDLC and security aspects were not implemented. It is trying to mature and is in the process."
"804","Great initiatives, and I loved the way senior management communicated concerns / news with their employees. A very satisfying workplace."
"805","The company could focus on enhancing internal opportunities for employees and compensating employees based on fair market value in order to retain the talent pool."
"806","Management could do a better job of assessing the subordinates' needs and career pursuits.  In addition, they could also tailor the work environment to assist the employees to accomplish their goals."
"807","A lot of politics, red tape, no real opportunities to learn or advance.  But this varies from team to team"
"808","Create incentive to innovate"
"809","Hard to move around the firm"
"810","More development opportunites and feedback for employees"
"811","Technical experts lack competency relative to other industry"
"812","Employee and trading floor morale is down in the gutter. Floors that were once occupied with staff are now empty halls. The majority in charge manages from Chicago, which is pretty frustrating if you work in New York."
"813","Promotions and compensation not evaluated the same across the department and departments and management doesn't keep the department informed."
"814","Treat people fairly and they will produce and be happy.  Promotions and compensation should be applied equally everywhere."
"815","CME Group's culture closely resembles the culture of a bad high school movie. Everyone who is in the ""in-crowd"" can expect to receive favorable raises and promotions, in spite of ability. Those who are ""outsiders"" can forget it. Education and ability are not equally rewarded, while incompetence is handsomely rewarded. And if you have the misfortune of belonging to a minority group, your chances of advancement are... nonexistent. Before the misguided purchase of the CBOT, one of the bylines of the CME was ""the Exchange of Ideas."" Unfortunately, a lot of the prevailing ideas concerning fairness and diversity at the Merc resemble some of the more odious ideas which were prevalent during the 19th century."
"816","There should be more emphasis on people rather than profits. If so, then maybe the majority of the talented people there would not jump ship like it was the Titanic."
"817","This is the worst place to work for, for a good software developer. All the guys who can't program or can't do anything productive get promoted to Associated Directors. Then the same crappy folks are in charge of reviewing the performance of bright developers who do the real work ! It's like an inverse pyramid, they have got the rotten people on top, on an average there are 2 managers for each dev/qa/analyst person.... Lot of red tape, politics goes on than real work, with so many Associate Directors it is normal to expect I presume.
One person takes the status, another person print it in excel and brings it to the meetings, another person reads it in the meetings, another person takes meeting notes and emails it out.
It takes on an average 10 years to build a new system cause of mismanagement and poor or no vision at all, that's why most work is maintenance/support work. 

All these factors naturally tend to promote mediocrity."
"818","Be real leaders and stop being  too political and defensive."
"819","The tendency to hire outside talent for high-level positions is disconcerting and underscores a lack of in-house career advancement and development. Also, politicking can get annoying."
"820","It is important to define clear pathways for employee advancement and the honus is on human resources and upper management to make this happen."
"821","Too political, no compensation, no room for growth. Promotions are not based around any set criteria and given arbitrarily by senior management. No performance raises or even much praise for a job well done."
"822","Need more motivating factors for employees to work above and beyond their required work load. There are no incentives and very little positive reinforcement. We are also competing with other companies that offer all of the things that are lacking here"
"823","Management needs leadership training. Some of the junior management have no clue on management and people skills. They can be traffic cops with attitude!"
"824","Send all management for management training and promote people  to management positions based on their leadership skills and not for their technical talent alone!"
"825","Highly competitive and fast changing environment means one has to study in order to keep up with both the many technology and strategic initiatives."
"826","The global initiative being persued by CME is a strategic move that will pay off handily in the long run."
"827","Incompetent middle management.  As mentioned in another review, lots of funny drama due to petty politics within the middle management (Up to the director level). Upper management should realize not all good technical people can be good managers and ADs. I am really surprise how some arrogant people are at that level."
"828","Please listen to the feedbacks and take action . It is not worth just collecting it once in every 6 months."
"829","CME does an awful job of handling their consultants. They treat them very poorly going out the door. I saw two instances where giving CME 2 weeks notice worked against those people. In one instance the consultant gave notice at 9 AM and was kicked out before 10 AM. The second instance a consultant gave notice EOD Monday and was let go EOD Tuesday. More than a few supervisors have less than stellar communication... skills (i.e. snarky, rude, snide, condescending commentary is the norm)."
"830","The two weeks notice thing will return to bite you.  It may not happen right away, but people will start to take notice and provide no notice if they decide to leave CME."
"831","lack of direct communication channel"
"832","good"
"833","It sometimes seems apparent that we are a small company that grew very quickly (due to mergers and / or  acquisitions)."
"834","Management tries to offer great weekly updates (and sometimes more frequently) depending on the current industry events.  Personal recognition from the management levels are appreciated."
"835","Managers show favoritism in who gets promoted, the least capable become managers because they are favorites of the boss. Incompetent people are allowed to stay even though they aren't producing at all. Tons of drama all the time due to unprofessional behavior by managers. Employees who act like kids are allowed to continue in their behavior. Bonuses have dried up and raises are very low compared to what they used to... be."
"836","Get rid of dead weight, it will help morale. Discipline unprofessional behavior by management and employees. Communicate more and work to establish a sense of camaraderie, which has been missing for years. Don't hire people into management roles if they don't have the necessary skills."
"837","Like any large corporation, there's lots of red tape and bureaucracy in between you and getting your job done. Politics and personality defects sometimes get in the way of good software engineering. It is a fight to get open-source solutions approved."
"838","Pay attention to software engineering up to the highest level. Information technology is an investment, not a cost center. Make sure devs feel actualized and involved in the software development process."
"839","limited flexibility in terms of transitioning departments, lots of politics, and never enough drama"
"840","The marketing department is a bit different than the other groups within CME. IT was very tough on the employees, and marketing was quite kind. However it seems that some of the most intelligent people were always on the ""outs"" even though they were the ones with the best ideas-- that ended up being stolen by their bosses."
"841","Career advancement is not clear.  The culture of favortism is strong.  Senior Management has a tendency to advance their lunch-buddies.  This leaves little or no room for advancement to managerial roles.  You literally have to leave your department to move up within the company."
"842","Management Training is a MUST!!  Numerous managers have been advanced to roles that they are absolutely not ready for!!  It is ridiculous how unprepared they are.  Everyone is not a People Manager.  Train Your Leadership Teams!!!"
"843","-cultural shift as a result of exponential growth (more corporate/structured/rigid)
-senior mgmt not in tune with level/volume of work being done at staff level"
"844","Employees at CME Group run too lean compared to other companies. The scope of their job goes beyond what a similar job at a comparable company would offer yet there is little recognition because managers (and/or sr mgmt who make headcount decisions) are so out of tune with the work being done and what's needed."
"845","My department has little promotion ability."
"846","Change the PMP process."
"847","no room for promotion at all. Management totally incompetent. very hard to learn new things. People don't feel like sharing their knowledge. Lots of favoritism."
"848","Listen to your employees, some of them have good ideas. It seems like management is afraid that if they listened to their employees. they'd lose respect from their peers."
"849","It can be tough maintain a good work/life balance"
"850","Keep working toward trying to improve the culture."
"851","you will work 6 days a week and close to 10 hour days. Your on call is a 2-4 man rotation which means sometimes you are on call twice a month and guess what it sucks. 

Also upper management does not care about you. They find the one or two people they like and promote them and give them the good shift. Also you will be working the afternoon shift as well. Plus when a boss transfers out they put a consultant with... 2 months experience in charge. CME is probably a great company if you don't work in the Data Center."
"852","Please take care of your lower level people. You have an extremely high turnover rate that could be avoided if you just listened

The final question is do you approve of the the ceo and the way he is leading CME Group? I answered NA because upper management never listens. They will act like it and have meetings and then don't give a rat's ass"
"853","Not a lot of flexibility for consultants.  Permanent employees do get the opportunity to work from home as needed.  Consultants aren't afforded the same luxury.  My guess is CME has burned a time or two with that."
"854","Take working from home for the consultants on a case-by-case basis versus a blanket policy."
"855","Some of the teams seem to be overstaffed. Verbal communication seems to be lacking in some areas of the company. Not many cons though."
"856","Management is very friendly so I couldn't really ask for anything else. Maybe a little bit more interaction with the team would be cool."
"857","dont start at this position they hold you down as much as possible and you never can get out"
"858","work on the moral of this department the negativity breeds from the management"
"859","Compliance work can be a bit dull at times."
"860","None at this time."
"861","Lived in a cubicle for a whole summer."
"862","Keep up the good work. But have more structure for new employees."
"863","Company was a little quick to halt salary increases and reduce bonuses as many other companies were making pay cuts, although the stock price increased about $125 a share during 2009.  I'm not sure how necessary the pay cuts were since the company was in sound financial condition.  May have been a ""preemptive strike"" if you will."
"864","Continue to support compensation that is performance based.  Encourage new ideas to come to light and provide technology to ensure CME competitive advantage."
"865","Low turnover in upper ranks - since successful employees are treated well, little people at the top leave.  It creates logjams for successful employess in lower levels."
"866","Continue to create incentive for successful employees to stay"
"867","Poor work life balance, hope you don't like your Saturdays and when random Production issues occur.  Cliquish, if you're not in with the right crowd you will no receive the same treatment when it comes to bonuses, promotions etc.  If you're good at playing the game, you'll be fine.  People hold on to knowledge, don't want to share."
"868","Promote knowledge sharing!"
"869","mediocre compensation - especially at lower ranks"
"870","need to encourage younger recruits to grow"
"871","Too much politics and favoritism. People are more interested in oneupmanship than actually getting any work done. Hard work should be recognized and rewarded appropriately."
"872","A sycophant culture is developing in CME in which people cannot express their opinions freely without fear of repercussion and are not rewarded on the basis of talent and performance but more along the likes of who you know."
"873","* Work / Life balance can be challenging at times.  Depending on your group / role, there may be frequent Saturday work.
* Crazy work pace at times. Many high priority projects
* Some counter-productive employees seem to be able to survive and remain employed
* Not a major con, but you will see a good amount of nepotism 
* Raises were mostly flat last couple of years."
"874","* Continue to work on work / life balance initiatives
* Spend additional time coaching (or weeding out) of a few counter-productive employees"
"875","managers are promoted because they are great at their jobs and have industry expertise however, they receive no guidance on how to treat the staff they are responsible for.  

Huge learning curve in the futures industry when you are coming out of college.  There is very little formal training."
"876","Please require a training for all employees that are promoted and will be supervising others."
"877","Management is underqualified and leaves employees feeling that they can do a better job than their superiors

The education courses are a waste of time because over half the class is used explaining common issues and does not leave enough time to even complete material"
"878","Really review the employees and offer bonuses or other incentives based on performance and not time there. There are definitely ""favorites"" when it comes to supervisors and if you are working for one of the lesser respected one, you too will also be looked down upon. This needs to be fixed immediately."
"879","While I understand that it is the norm to have cubicle farms at larger companies, I find them to be limiting.  My boss was a 5 min walk from my desk and I felt like I had little interaction with them.  The corporate culture was also unlike some of my previous experiences, not bad, just a very 9-5 vibe with many employees with very little passion."
"880","I'm very glad that I took the internship, however, I don't know that I could work there based on the lack of passion exuded from many employees.  I think there's a huge disconnect from the work that they are doing and the results that the company sees."
"881","If you don't like to put in the hours... Don't bother. If you don't like constant changes... don't bother. If you like to get settled in doing the same thing every day.... don't bother. Change is constant.... change is good"
"882","Change ways of promotion.... Don't make it like everyother job where it's who you know and not what you know"
"883","CME Group has a very deep hierarchical organization which leads to a lot of politics, turf battles bringing a lot inefficiencies, unflexibilities, difficulty to have important decisions made."
"884",". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
"885","The adage ""It's not what you know but who you know"" appears  to be the rule in many of the hiring and promotional decisions."
"886","All  the other posts that have been written so far to the  Management about this company are right on target."
"887","I think the lower rungs of the employment chain make the worst money. If you pay your dues, you might get promoted."
"888","I would make sure that he has a firm grasp on the way the lower level employees are being treated."
"889","Developers are expected to be on call twenty four hours for support of systems.  Fun once in a while but can quickly become too much if you are working on a downstream systems.  Endless data changes will keep you beyond busy."
"890","Measure everyone with the same stick."
"891","An entry level security guard will advance further than someone with a degree who works on the trading floor as a Market Reporter. I TOTALLY AGREE with the other reviews."
"892","Go to college...get a degree so you won't feel insecure by an employee who has one!"
"893","Management can be incompetent--particularly managment at the floor operations level.  Review system is ridiculous-almost have to walk on water to recieve a 3 out of 5 on rating system."
"894","Too many cooks in the kitchen.  There are far too many layers of management at this organization.  It seems as if they ccreated the ""Associate Director"" level because they just did'nt want to get rid of incompetents."
"895","Unwillingness to change the set ways of some officers."
"896","Acceptance of legacy CBOT and NYMEX employees is not felt throughout the ranks."
"897","structured, more political than it used to be 4 years ago, top heavy, integration issues, technology division does not operate uniformly, QA problems are solved by throwing more people, too much manual testing, useless directors"
"898","senior management needs to bring the agility back to the environment. They also needs use this environment to elan the organization. There are junk departments like CPO, SIG etc, with no value"
"899","Departments are siloed both internally and externally.  Communication is not the best inter-departmentally.  With the size of the company being what it is one would think the company would be much more nimble than it currently is.  It takes a long time to get simple little things completed unlike the large impact project."
"900","Keep up the good work.  Senior Management seems to be precognitive like I have never seen before."
"901","Seniority generally matters quite a bit in promoting.  Generally I did not find much to complain about at CME Group.  After the Board of Trade merger there were substantial layoffs, but those were caused by the merger and do not seem to carry over at all."
"902","Allow people to switch between departments more easily."
"903","Organizational structure is questionable and manager performance can be sub par at times. Workload can be somewhat demanding at times and will often require additional hours to be put it on the weekend for the busier weeks. With a large IT department within the company there are times when communication is not effectively established across given departments which in turn hinders the work process. 

The overall... structure of the company is efficient, but at times it seems as if the two divisions are organizations of their own which can cause some slight problems. Other than that, in my time there I didn't experience too many major downsides to CME Group."
"904","Continue making decisions that will advance the company growth-wise."
