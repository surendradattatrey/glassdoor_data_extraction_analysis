"205",24,"* Outstanding company to work for in terms of aptitude of people, healthy office culture, investment in product development and quality of product, relentless high touch focus on the customer. All the benefits you might expect from a global FinServ firm. 401k match, quality healthcare benefits, generous vacation time, in-office perks etc.

* Generous base salary especially through career progression and... out-performance. Sales bonus compensation is not directly tied to target/quota achievement making for a much more consultative, relationship based and less aggressive sales environment for clients. Qualitative / culture based metrics ensure high performance is not only based on quota, territory etc.

* Move towards more of a dollar quota culture in recent years is positive. Especially for Bloomberg terminal core sales staff this presents an opportunity to become a true enterprise account executive, versus traditionally selling units / terminals. This in turn becomes a more transferable experience. The high calibre sales people at Bloomberg I know of have embraced this change.

* Exceptional sales support network for post sales client support from the Analytics department and wider product/support groups. This takes admin-weight off sales significantly and has improved massively over the last 5 years. 

* Whilst a healthy pressure exists to hit quota, Bloomberg sales is not a cut-throat sales environment like e.g. Salesforce. This promotes a much healthier, collaborative working environment where sales are not stepping on each other. There is monetary recognition of collaboration and other BBg culture metrics.

* Strong culture of internal promotion especially into leadership positions -most of which are filled through home-grown talent. For me personally this was recognized through generous compensation at each stage.

My review for pros and cons centers on experiences in the financial products realm, not engineering, news or media. In terms of pros, Bloomberg has some great, really good, and good things going for it. 
 
There are some genuinely talented, smart people who when given the chance can do some great work. The... culture and environment is extremely energised and lively, and there is always a buzz in any of the top notch global offices. The Bloomberg Way of start executing, building, or doing first and figure out as you go along can be very powerful (but also detrimental as outlined in cons). 

The benefits are overall generally strong (especially in the US with no healthcare premiums) but not over the top. Some great cultural benefits and partner programs. 

Philanthropy is a huge part of the company and there are numerous ways to feel a part of that. The majority of company profits do go to funding Mike Bloomberg's philanthropic initiatives, which if you are aligned with those (like me) then it's great. There are also weekly (if not daily)  ways to get involved in countless other volunteering initiatives.","4.0"

They vet for the best and make every effort to make you successful in the company. If a team dissolves, they will work with you to find a new team - at least for engineers. The work from home capabilities are decent. You can wear... whatever you want. Literally. Before I joined I thought BB was a stiff-necked cross between a bank and hedge fund. Nope. I was happily mistaken. They have fresh fruit, free soup, tons of coffee, and snacks for free - daily. Oh, and every office is littered with tons of exotic salt & fresh water tanks.

"397",44,"I’ve worked at Bloomberg Intelligence long enough to know the future here is far brighter than stuck in a broken bulge-bracket boiler room (do you remember the heyday - when the buyside trusted their views, Associates loved their jobs and Analysts didn’t live layoff-to-layoff? Then you are alone...). Like most of my senior colleagues, I was a successful Analyst at a traditional research shop you‘d know. Here I have... more client access, more access to companies and experts, and more resources to build my franchise. It would take a true lack of vision to ever go back.

I decided to write this after reading several narrow-minded nuggets, lobbed into this forum by some grumpy elves (so scarce at BI, most of us can guess who). I hope I can offer some balance, and not sound promotional because, frankly, working here is pretty good. I’ve taken enough interviews to know I have good options, and seen a few peers leave for seats they really wanted. To me, BI is the best place to be.

I’d also like to counter some of the unfair baloney leveled at management. I’m not a manager, but their fairness and vision is a key reason that I joined and that I stay. Know any “leaders” you’d follow among those still squeezing pennies out of sellside sweatshops? Ours have the honesty to see the legacy biases, vision to shape a novel product, and guts to get started.

The BI product is fun to write and powerful to read because a generalist can quickly engage it, an expert can dive deep, it is soaked in data and it is modular in a way that brings the right analyst’s voice into the right part of any report. Imagine writing a detailed research piece, but knowing your peers would link your best paragraphs right into their own work – and that you’d better recheck it often, because the graphs are live!

As an Associate, the pieces we author on industry basic concepts and indicators will be yours to write sooner than anywhere else. You’ll build company models experienced buysiders use to actually make decisions (not ones designed to play the “call me, I’m far out of consensus!” game)

You’ll also battle a bunch of weird new technology systems, and always wonder that the “rules” are! Why? Because, this is NOT an ancient financial house where a bunch of well-connected jerks rig rules to make sure you can’t get your full bonus or take their cushy job. This IS a (well-funded) startup, where quickly making anything new or cool clients want comes before designing a clear, simple career path for you and us. But, as always in life, uncertainty comes with benefits.

As an Associate, us Analysts will actually teach you to pick up coverage. We are growing, we have a lot more to cover and we don’t have to defend ourselves against your career progress! Oh, and we’ll let you have time to have a life at the end of the day. Oh, and you’ll actually make some friends, because it isn’t “you or them” in the next round of inevitable layoffs (see history of “real research” shops). Oh, and the top-to-bottom pay disparity here is FAR narrower than any I’ve seen on the street. Oh, and you’ll get to work at Bloomberg – where people are much happier overall than most places.

As an Analyst, you either already see why this is a great place – or not. In the latter case I’d probably respect you, but not want to work with you. I came here for novelty and innovation and to be with colleagues who were also uninspired by the bare-knuckles battle down the old-school path. Frankly, I’ve been paid well enough that I’m still glad I took the risk. Best of luck with MiFID 2!","5.0"
