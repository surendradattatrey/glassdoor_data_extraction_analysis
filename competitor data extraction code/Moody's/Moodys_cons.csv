This is due to cost cutting due to ""poor"" results (double digit growth, but missed target...) They sold/rented out a floor and moved people around, fired some, no budget for anything at all. Senior employees with company stock probably don't care, but junior people are leaving in droves. But this seems to... be a part of the plan. The company seldom fires, it just pushes people out. Which leads me to the main issue, this organisation is the direct opposite of a meritocracy. There's tons of politics and they would rather promote someone attending Diversity & Inclusion events (or fitting a minority) than people actually performing well. This is a good place to land after you're too tired to work hard and just want to take it easy with pretty smart people with a nice salary and you're willing to accept nonsense politics."

Work life balance nonexistent if you actually want to perform all... your daily tasks. Nonexistent opportunities of growth.

- Salary progression is very close to zero, even after a promotion
- Employee management inexistent, so best employees with... good opportunities elsehwere will just walk away as soon as they can
- Exit opportunities are very limited. Having ""Moody's"" written on one's CV is not always looked at favourably by recruiters at other financial institutions

- The poor management skills of low and middle-level managers are a scandal in broad daylight

The company used to have the people you actually work with have more say in your advancement, but recently, the company introduced middle managers who don't see/understand your work as much, but have a large say in your advancement, so sucking up matters way more than performance.
Also, due to poor management of handling regulatory compliance, there are teams of... people who exist to try and catch you not checking the right box so you can get your bonus taken away. It never happened to me, but it did to people I know and living in fear of the compliance cops isn't fun. Also, lots of lifers work here, so get used to unintentional caps lock and constant whining about how they don't understand the electric typing box."

A con for me but if you are friends with the right person or liked by the right person, you will have a much easier time moving up or going anywhere in the company. On the flip side, if you are not friends with the right person, it can be an arduous... journey. While not necessarily in silos, it seems like every team has a different set of rules on how they can or cannot move up the corporate ladder.

Miserable place for women, who get layered under lazy and unproductive male managers, who in turn take credit for work performed by others. A technological dinosaur, which pours money into ""innovation"" that never materializes. And so on..."
"130","The business model is strange. It’s a conflict of ethics. You are paid by those you rate. Yet for some reason the market accepts your ratings. I can’t explain it.

They pay lip service to ethics but believe me they know on which side their bread is buttered. You simply cannot expect a billion dollar company with 20% profit margins to be angelic. If you do, I have a bridge just right for you.

The systems engineering team have no presence outside of NY and don’t provide anything helpful anyway in terms of technology or tools. 

Several third party vendors that carry out tasks at a very granular level so difficult to find the right... person. Support from most of those vendors is terrible, they simply don’t care. They have finally decided to streamline and bring in one to take over at least three of those companies so maybe things will improve. 

People will ignore your emails, including senior management. You have to CC in someone important if you need support from people or for them to simply do their actual job.

I suggested many improvements but kept getting  knock-backs. Senior people came up with excuses probably because they were protecting their highly paid positions. 

The only projects you are asked to get involved with are the ones that nobody else wants to do. You’re not asked what you’d like to do. Many broken processes which can create chaos for users.  

In term of progression it is non-existent unless you are already in a senior role or if you are very young and seen to have potential. You can’t be in your thirties and have potential or existing talent. 

Also how about some regular department drinks once in a while rather then only if a senior person from the US comes over with their credit card. Not much team bonding."
"136","Career growth  which is very less"

- career progression is terrible. They have tried to change this by introducing a different organisational structure in 2017, but nothing really... has changed. Going from AA3 to Analyst takes on average 5 years. Way too long considering you pretty much do the exact same type of work as an Analyst!
- Boring work. This is subjective of course but I don't think that anyone finds putting numbers into Scorecards to get a rating to be exciting. Basically, a lot of the people here pretend that they do real finance work (and sometimes also stay until midnight to prove they are like bankers) but at the end of the day the product is mostly putting financial metrics into a Scorecards and then write a report about the outcome."

There have been several occasions when employees have left without another job waiting... for them.

 The Ugly:  the Leadership & Organizational Development group, since there is no leadership or organization at the top of the department. In the past few years there has been a nearly 100% turnover. That is unacceptable.

I single out L&OD because the senior leaders, who are the key drivers of the Employee Value Proposition, seem to live by the mantra, ""Our views matter. Yours do when they mirror ours."" The senior leadership is rewarded for implementing early 21st Century ideas to enhance L&OD, meanwhile sucking up valuable resources by taking leadership training instead of providing that training to someone who could actually benefit from it. Incompetence and lack of communication skills are rewarded, hence the turnover.

The turnover rate for associate analysts in 2014 was especially high (40%) for a good reason.  People with ambition who can do this job well are in high demand at banks for much higher compensation.

The internal technology (mobile devices, data systems,... workflow systems, personal computers, remote work technologies etc.) are all probably 10 years behind.  I was surprised when I started at how antiquated the technology was.  There does not appear to be a lot of appetite for updating technologies so the outlook going forward remains negative. 

Culture: Moody's seems to have a very conservative business culture.  Decisions can take a long time to get made and can result in ""analysis paralysis"".

Because the standards were so low when the managers were analysts themselves, they have a hard time... understanding what investors or issuers want and end up giving direction that is often reversed later.  As a result, we've had to bring in more managers to figure out what investors want and how to produce better research.

Too many administrative works and internal reports
Too many time-wasting training
Ever-changing procedures
Poor promotion/ career prospect
Incompetence of senior management with most are previously analyst"
"605","1. Management culture is meandering at the moment. 
2. Senior management has not been able to root out a lot of managers who should have been shown the door post crisis. Most of upper management probably does not know the meaning of real work, as they are used to see business running on its own."
"606","from the time i have been here so far, there isn't a lot to say.
Moody's is not the right place for people who don't have enough autonomy, you should go towards the other and show that you are there"
"607","Develop more programs to promote from within"
"608","Work-life balance is difficult to achieve.  The more you do the more is expected."
"609","- very stressful environment
- little leverage vs. an incompetent superior (hr not helpful)
- lack of diversity in senior or mid-level positions"
"610","Pay is lacking compared to the work you do. Management is very stingy when it comes to handing out pay raises and bonuses."
"611","It's difficult to get appropriate compensation as your title and/or responsibilities grow - must fight
Luck of pressure may mean less chances for growth or need for self-education, but it depends on position"
"612","Promotions are very hard to come by and are often awarded based on popularity rather than the person actually deserving it.  It seems you build all of the experience and skills that you need to progress, but have to fight for a promotion."
"613","not very exciting. don't promote talent from within. it's a great place to work if you're a seasoned veteran: you get great hours, geat pay, and it's not too stressful. however, if you're a recent grad i would steer clear. they tend to use entry level analysts and associates without any intention of promoting them."
"614","Very manual work, not as automated as one would think"
"615","Very hard to get promoted. The work life balance is poor. Pay is very low compared to other similar industries."
"616","Lack of promotion availabilities.
Preferntial treatment  of certain employees when it came to promoting.
Lack of growth opportunities."
"617","- Promotion is not really related to perfomance
- Compensation is not great and pay increase rarely happens
- Actual work does not change with the job title
- Not interested in retaining high performers"
"618","The company has recently gotten a lot of bad publicity with the ratings of structured securities. It will likely take time for the company to regain momentum."
"619","-Compensation is not very high compared to other firms in finance.
-The teams within the company need to work together."
"620","No means of growth beyond your current job description in support functions. Do not expect to come in and transfer to another role/department.
Moody's brand value has taken a hit over the past couple years. Will take some time to earn back the respect of the financial community.

Team concept is overshawdowed by individual interests."
"621","Career possibilities especially after the recent crisis are fairly limited, and the company is in a stationary state. No retention policy, promotions by seniority in the job, and salary discrepancy between the senior employees that progressed in their carreers before the crisis and the one that joined around 2007."
"622","-Very low pay compared to other financial firms
-Known for having incompetent, untalented employees 
-Unfairness in promotions
-Too political
-Too much power given to managers - if you have a bad manager, it is a dead end job"
"623","Performance review and promotion process remains opaque and inconsistent despite continuing enhancement
Below average pay relative to other financial services firms
Poor work/life balance
In the downturn, Moody's has shown little employee loyalty negating the stability/lower pay trade-off"
"624","Compensation is not great even in good years compared to the rest of the financial services industry.  As with any other company, politics can play a part in career advancement."
"625","lack of direction during and after the crisis 
performance evaluation and promotions opaque at best 
negative culture based on sycophancy"
"626","Pay is one of the first big downers
Morale low after several rounds of layoffs (but understandable as company slipped to $1b in revenues from $2b)
Promotion track somewhat uncharted for junior people - 'high yield team' created for this purpose but generally viewed as a place where you do not want to find yourself given the many additional layers of work for same amount of pay and no additional... visibility/recognition
Mentor program during infancy stage - no structure during 1st year running (but potential is there)"
"627","Knee jerk reactions to market conditions internally; slow response externally
Poor compensation structure means that the best analysts often leave
Opportunity to advance are made more readily available to those who have key relationships and not necessarily the best workers
High often unattainable stardards"
"628","Ability to claw back as a brand after the subprime debacle. The brand has taken a beating in the press and in the congress with the way the ratings were deemed to fail how it communicated credit worthiness of the security to investors. It will be interesting to see what legislature decides as the role credit rating agencies will play in the future of capital markets. The next few months and even a year will redefine... the way the company will evolve- most certainly it wont enjoy its position as it did pre-2007."
"629","-boys club
-women will never get ahead there
-brian clarkson made the ratings biz commerical endeavour therefore helping in the downfall of the world markets"
"630","Employees treated like disposable parts.  Often times, the hiring process seems to be completely random.  I had excellent grades from a top undergraduate business school.  No one wanted to interview me for a full time job.  The management is very disrespectful to lower ranking employees.  Very hierarchical.  It is the McDonald's of financial services firms: they have a franchise (i.e. the ratings, which often are... required); they have their standard models, and they hire randomly people that can plug in numbers into their models.

The mortgage crisis has pulled the tide out on Moody's, and showed that Moody's too, was swimming naked.  They are all about the cash, no integrity - in the way that they treat people and in the way that they rate securities.

Moody's is probably a good business, it generates a lot of cash flow, but in my experience, that definitely doesn't translate into a good place to work - it's a lousy place to work."
"631","you bear all the downside, whilst there is only minimum upside"
"632","Don't work here if you want to climb the ladder quickly - lifers are everywhere.  Underperformers are not weeded out until there's a fire, and then both good and bad are let go.  It's not like MS or Goldman where it's ""up or out"" -- here, you will have a nice office with decent pay and benefits, but promotions take forever because there is so little turnover at the management ranks."
"633","Underappreciated work and poor morale affected the quality of work.
Innovators beware, this is not a place that values innovative ideas.
You are measured against a very precise set of metrics, this can be good for some, and bad for others.
Management attempts to create competition amongst employees in order improve efficiency, in the end, this creates more animosity and less efficiency."
"634","Long hours and heavy workloads. Not really work/life balance friendly but then again, not substantially worse than other companies in this field."
"635","Where do I start.  Getting a promotion means you get a higher title,  but not more or different responsibilites/ tasks.  Worked long hours, on the weekend, on call without compensation.   No matter how much effort, time, and work put forth, the pressure would not be lightened?? The type of pressure was destructive, anti-growth, and often filled with anger.  Management has a ""what have you've done for me lately... attitude"" towards IT.   You could be a supreme tech.  It doesn't mean squat here - just that your a good door mat or should become one if you want to remain employed.  Shoot first ask questions later mentality with issues, even after proof was found that the wrong person was accused of  ""dropping the ball"".  If one of their ""own"" made a mistake no matter how big, they called it an honest mistake. but God forbid if it was anyone else does, then you can count on seeing that on your perfomance evaluation.   They company offered training but no training was allowed for the group and their were no growth opportunites.   No motivation to take initiative by colleagues past what is minimally expected by management.  Being skilled/smart, having seniorty is not valued.   Extreme nepotism/favoritism.  It was without a doubt the case here - If you were a certain ethnicity, not only did you get top salary, but you had the most opportunities / leeway / and pretty much got away with a lot of things.  Like ""extra"" vacation time then what is allotted."
"636","Compensation is not competitive.   When you get a promotion, do not expect any change in scope of responsibilities or adjustment in compensation.   Lot's of double standards for promotion guidelines."
"637","Recognizing the inherent need for a rating agency to adhere to regulatory compliance, there is excessive bureaucracy and processes even for a large organization. Negative connotations associated with the name given recent credit market developments. Definite lack of promotional prospects."
"638","rating agency, need i say more!"
"639","Reactionary management, small bonuses, and a staff that generally is not ""best of class"".  The best and the brightest don't work at Moody's - and if they do, they will soon leave.  People will not get rich there - you might not even afford to live in Manhattan.  Company moral is not strong right now."
"640","It is not a particularly challenging environment because it is very bureaucratic and new ideas/changes are not often welcomed. Risk doesn't seem to be something the firm operationally mitigates , but rather tries to avoid all together. Not a great formula for strategic growth by any means."
"641","The technology-- computer systems-- are subpar and they can't seem to fix that.  e.g. The help desk has recently been outsourced and people report long waits to get help.  Or Blackberries arrived at Moody's years after every one else had them.  Also, management has a hard time prioritizing which means that analysts can be overwhelmed.  They are also going through a transition given all of the negative press and... transitions in general are hard.  Finally, while the salaries are decent, they are below those of IBankers and Bond INsurers and as a result there is more turnover than there should be."
"642","dysfunctional bunch of 2nd guessing micro-managers; organizational paralysis; good people leave, incompetent ones stay on."
"643","Regardless whether you are a junior or a senior employee you should expect to be treated like crap by your supervisors (who in turn are ill-treated by their superiors), be significantly underpaid relative to peers at firms on Wall Street (almost by an order of magnitude)."
"644","management lost its damn mind.  i think the thing that everyone knows and no one is saying is that the business was driven by market share and revenue. managers that created revenue, even over ratings integrity, were promoted quickly.  i suppose this is the issue of a rating agency going public."
"645","Lower salaries than the rest of wall st. It used to be mitigated by stability, but with recent layoffs that stability is no longer there."
"646","Lack of career direction, growth and planning.  There's no where to go, unless your boss is outplaced or leaves."
"647","Very New York-centric, which can cause resentment outside of US. The company has grown extremely rapidly in the past few years, and this can create a chaotic feel in the way the corporation presents itself to the world. 

Projects aren't always managed effectively to completion, partly because of the rapid growth just mentioned, but also sometimes due of a lack of focus from senior management.

Increasing... regulatory focus on credit agencies means the company will face a very difficult couple of years ahead, as it tries to justify it's place and function in the markets."
