1,Ability to claw back as a brand after the subprime debacle. The brand has taken a beating in the press and in the congress with the way the ratings were deemed to fail how it communicated credit worthiness of the security to investors. It will be interesting to see what legislature decides as the role credit rating agencies will play in the future of capital markets. The next few months and even a year will redefine... the way the company will evolve- most certainly it wont enjoy its position as it did pre-2007.
2,Do not reward mediocrity
3,"-boys club
-women will never get ahead there
-brian clarkson made the ratings biz commerical endeavour therefore helping in the downfall of the world markets"
4,"-there are middle managers in sales that are blowing smoke and runing peoples careers 
-there are too many managers and not enough workers (sales people, trainers)"
5,"Employees treated like disposable parts.  Often times, the hiring process seems to be completely random.  I had excellent grades from a top undergraduate business school.  No one wanted to interview me for a full time job.  The management is very disrespectful to lower ranking employees.  Very hierarchical.  It is the McDonald's of financial services firms: they have a franchise (i.e. the ratings, which often are... required); they have their standard models, and they hire randomly people that can plug in numbers into their models.

The mortgage crisis has pulled the tide out on Moody's, and showed that Moody's too, was swimming naked.  They are all about the cash, no integrity - in the way that they treat people and in the way that they rate securities.

Moody's is probably a good business, it generates a lot of cash flow, but in my experience, that definitely doesn't translate into a good place to work - it's a lousy place to work."
6,Get a clue.
7,"you bear all the downside, whilst there is only minimum upside"
8,hand out stock-option to staff to retain when the market picks up again
9,"Don't work here if you want to climb the ladder quickly - lifers are everywhere.  Underperformers are not weeded out until there's a fire, and then both good and bad are let go.  It's not like MS or Goldman where it's ""up or out"" -- here, you will have a nice office with decent pay and benefits, but promotions take forever because there is so little turnover at the management ranks."
10,Become less dependent on ratings revenue.
11,"Underappreciated work and poor morale affected the quality of work.
Innovators beware, this is not a place that values innovative ideas.
You are measured against a very precise set of metrics, this can be good for some, and bad for others.
Management attempts to create competition amongst employees in order improve efficiency, in the end, this creates more animosity and less efficiency."
12,Treat employees with more dignity and respect
13,"Long hours and heavy workloads. Not really work/life balance friendly but then again, not substantially worse than other companies in this field."
14,"Expectations management. Don't throw people on work they have no experience in and expect miracles or quality work from the get-go. But then again, this is just personal experience and might not be a general issue."
15,"Where do I start.  Getting a promotion means you get a higher title,  but not more or different responsibilites/ tasks.  Worked long hours, on the weekend, on call without compensation.   No matter how much effort, time, and work put forth, the pressure would not be lightened?? The type of pressure was destructive, anti-growth, and often filled with anger.  Management has a ""what have you've done for me lately... attitude"" towards IT.   You could be a supreme tech.  It doesn't mean squat here - just that your a good door mat or should become one if you want to remain employed.  Shoot first ask questions later mentality with issues, even after proof was found that the wrong person was accused of  ""dropping the ball"".  If one of their ""own"" made a mistake no matter how big, they called it an honest mistake. but God forbid if it was anyone else does, then you can count on seeing that on your perfomance evaluation.   They company offered training but no training was allowed for the group and their were no growth opportunites.   No motivation to take initiative by colleagues past what is minimally expected by management.  Being skilled/smart, having seniorty is not valued.   Extreme nepotism/favoritism.  It was without a doubt the case here - If you were a certain ethnicity, not only did you get top salary, but you had the most opportunities / leeway / and pretty much got away with a lot of things.  Like ""extra"" vacation time then what is allotted."
16,"Put methods in place that will hold senior management accountable of the sub-groups they manage.  Have a third party administer a survey to be taken by employees of those managers that  evaluate the ""performance of managers""."
17,"Compensation is not competitive.   When you get a promotion, do not expect any change in scope of responsibilities or adjustment in compensation.   Lot's of double standards for promotion guidelines."
18,Management should really try and standardize promotion guidelines.   They are beginning to lose meaning to a lot of people.   Also should look more closely at compensation bands.   Lot's of inequality in pay within the same department.
19,"Recognizing the inherent need for a rating agency to adhere to regulatory compliance, there is excessive bureaucracy and processes even for a large organization. Negative connotations associated with the name given recent credit market developments. Definite lack of promotional prospects."
20,"To perpetually manage to the bottom line and be overly sensitive to shareholder demands especially when you have an inverted pyramid structure means that the company will suffer in the long-term. This is already evident in the lack of qualified applicants interested in associating themselves with the brand. Given the state of the job markets, this speaks volumes."
21,The company has recently gotten a lot of bad publicity with the ratings of structured securities. It will likely take time for the company to regain momentum.
22,Grow Moody's Analytics
23,"-Compensation is not very high compared to other firms in finance.
-The teams within the company need to work together."
24,They are doing a great job with the townhall meetings and letting people know that hard work is appreciated by management.
25,"No means of growth beyond your current job description in support functions. Do not expect to come in and transfer to another role/department.
Moody's brand value has taken a hit over the past couple years. Will take some time to earn back the respect of the financial community.

Team concept is overshawdowed by individual interests."
26,Expand the Growth/Development program. Encourage  job cross training
27,"Career possibilities especially after the recent crisis are fairly limited, and the company is in a stationary state. No retention policy, promotions by seniority in the job, and salary discrepancy between the senior employees that progressed in their carreers before the crisis and the one that joined around 2007."
28,A lean structure would probably better palce the comapny towards the challenges of a new financial environment. A restructuring is needed in orther to be ready to capture future market possibilities. This would also allow to incentivize the remaining employees that are now generally affected by a lack of motivation from the economic point of view but also from the professional one because they feel that we have no... clear direction to take.
29,"-Very low pay compared to other financial firms
-Known for having incompetent, untalented employees 
-Unfairness in promotions
-Too political
-Too much power given to managers - if you have a bad manager, it is a dead end job"
30,"Don't promote people based on favoritism
Do promote and recognize employees who may be members of groups that may not be part of business lines"
31,"Performance review and promotion process remains opaque and inconsistent despite continuing enhancement
Below average pay relative to other financial services firms
Poor work/life balance
In the downturn, Moody's has shown little employee loyalty negating the stability/lower pay trade-off"
32,"If you want to retain high quality employees and your future senior management, implement a true pay-for-performance culture with clear, consistent and measurable goals for entry-level to senior level employees.  Address inherent conflicts of interest head-on."
33,"Compensation is not great even in good years compared to the rest of the financial services industry.  As with any other company, politics can play a part in career advancement."
34,"Need to take more steps to re-establish Moody's reputation on the main street as well as Wall Street, and need to take steps to ensure Corporate rating group which has performed consistently well does not continue to be tarnished because of Structured Finance group."
35,"lack of direction during and after the crisis 
performance evaluation and promotions opaque at best 
negative culture based on sycophancy"
36,do a thorough strategic review of the company
37,"Pay is one of the first big downers
Morale low after several rounds of layoffs (but understandable as company slipped to $1b in revenues from $2b)
Promotion track somewhat uncharted for junior people - 'high yield team' created for this purpose but generally viewed as a place where you do not want to find yourself given the many additional layers of work for same amount of pay and no additional... visibility/recognition
Mentor program during infancy stage - no structure during 1st year running (but potential is there)"
38,Listen AND implement things for your junior people more (support staff SA + AA level) since we do a boat load of grunt work. Do not make us feel like we are easily replacable.
39,"Knee jerk reactions to market conditions internally; slow response externally
Poor compensation structure means that the best analysts often leave
Opportunity to advance are made more readily available to those who have key relationships and not necessarily the best workers
High often unattainable stardards"
40,Pay staff instead of stockholders to maintain if you want to keep high quality staff because turnover can burn out the senior staff members who are consistently in training mode.
41,Work-life balance is difficult to achieve.  The more you do the more is expected.
42,Get in touch with the views of the employees more rather than just paying them lip service.  Be more visible and listen.
43,"- very stressful environment
- little leverage vs. an incompetent superior (hr not helpful)
- lack of diversity in senior or mid-level positions"
44,"- enact a 360 review process to ensure transparency
- focus on integrity and ensure employees are empowered at all levels"
45,Pay is lacking compared to the work you do. Management is very stingy when it comes to handing out pay raises and bonuses.
46,Focus on career development and talent retention.  If you could identify and nurture your top Associates you'd have a bright class of future lead credit analysts.
47,"It's difficult to get appropriate compensation as your title and/or responsibilities grow - must fight
Luck of pressure may mean less chances for growth or need for self-education, but it depends on position"
48,"Frequent changes in management or directions don't promote morale.
Keep eye on proper rewarding of hard-working talents or you lose them."
49,"Promotions are very hard to come by and are often awarded based on popularity rather than the person actually deserving it.  It seems you build all of the experience and skills that you need to progress, but have to fight for a promotion."
50,A documented promotion policy for non-officer titles should be available to employees so that they are more aware of what is expected in order to progress to the next level.
51,"not very exciting. don't promote talent from within. it's a great place to work if you're a seasoned veteran: you get great hours, geat pay, and it's not too stressful. however, if you're a recent grad i would steer clear. they tend to use entry level analysts and associates without any intention of promoting them."
52,learn to incubate talent. moody's loses a lot of smart talented people to buy-side firms and banks because they refuse to offer any sort of professional advancement path. the pay could also be better.
53,"Very manual work, not as automated as one would think"
54,keep up the good work
55,Very hard to get promoted. The work life balance is poor. Pay is very low compared to other similar industries.
56,Increase compensation and value your employees and turn over will decrease
57,"Lack of promotion availabilities.
Preferntial treatment  of certain employees when it came to promoting.
Lack of growth opportunities."
58,Start developing and investing into growth of junior employees. This is the talent that will make Moody's survive despite it's currently troubles.
59,"- Promotion is not really related to perfomance
- Compensation is not great and pay increase rarely happens
- Actual work does not change with the job title
- Not interested in retaining high performers"
60,Senior management should seriously consider staff retension as the high priority agenda as a lot of good analysts are leaving the company having been treated poorly during the crisis. Promotion and compensation issues need to be sorted out as soon as possible.
61,salary is low compared to others.
62,"Work more with the junior talent and accept new ideas from them.
More opportunities to get promoted. Also salary increases are not in line with performance."
63,"The main downside of Moody's is its ongoing lack of sufficient internal investment, in particular the IT infrastructure, its cutting corners when in comes to giving people the right tools to do their job properly. Much of this is down to the company's continued aggressive focus on shareholder value."
64,Bring down operating margins by investing into the sustainability of the company! Revamp IT infratsructure. More focus on development of juniors.
65,compensation is below market average. not good for those who like to work in fast paced environment. the company's name is unfortunately all over the news since hte crisis began.
66,"mistakes from which we learn a lesson and commit to not making again are called ""Experience"". hopefully, the company can learn from past mistakes and pay more attention to surveillance of old ratings, and accuracy on new ones."
67,"- Poor managers are the norm, because the smarter ones already got bigger, better opportunities elsewhere
- Join the company either early on your career or late. Dont join this if you have organic growth in mind within the company
- Promotion policies"
68,#NAME?
69,"- An unusually high number of managers, many of whom seem to be doing duplicate jobs;
- Managers can be poor examples when it comes to work ethic and analysis, which is creating a lot of resentment, particularly because the workload has increased substa"
70,"Given where Moody's stock is trading, forcing the staff to work harder is understandable, but you can't raise expectations for the analysts without raising expectations for the managers.  Many managers simply don't have any credibility, having never worked a weekend (or late night) even at the height of the credit crisis."
71,"Compensation is not competitive among Wall St firms. Because we are not really a Wall St firm.
When I first joined the culture was very old school very laid back. Over the past 6 yrs it has changed into a faster pace, profit driven company.
Most professionals have offices and this makes the atmosphere feel very isolated."
72,Let's stop defending what we did in the market and start leading.
73,"Not paying respect to (junior) staffs
Extremely low salary and bonus
Too many administrative works and internal reports
Too many time-wasting training
Ever-changing procedures
Poor promotion/ career prospect
Incompetence of senior management with most are previously analyst"
74,"Please tell the truth to new hires or those who want to join - don't expect to get promotion anytime soon, you will get promoted in 5 year if you are lucky and know how to please your boss' boss."
75,"1. Management culture is meandering at the moment. 
2. Senior management has not been able to root out a lot of managers who should have been shown the door post crisis. Most of upper management probably does not know the meaning of real work, as they are used to see business running on its own."
76,"1. Fire nearly all of the middle managers, esp. on the structured finance size and especially anyone who has been managing for more than 6-7 years. Remove duplication. Define the performance culture."
77,"from the time i have been here so far, there isn't a lot to say.
Moody's is not the right place for people who don't have enough autonomy, you should go towards the other and show that you are there"
78,"The management is very good and active, they are always in contact with everyone. 
We don't really feel any hierarchy in the company, everyone is friendly and present.
what the company should me doing more is giving more incentives to employees, by giving bonuses, which is what every employee looks for especially in the financial sector"
79,Low compensation and no professional development
80,Develop more programs to promote from within
81,"Some/often long hours.  Usually not enough, or very little in the way of training.  Bonuses were not always fairly distributed, and stock options were more for the chosen few.  The culture of some managers were that they were hands-on micromanagers, protective of their own jobs, and not willing to hire talent greater than their own.  This led to middle management getting top-heavy due to tenure rather than skill set....  As a result, a lot of good people (at and below middle management level) were let go."
82,"The cuture of hard work being duly compensated was what built Moodys into what it WAS - Farming out labor to the lowest bidder gets you what you pay for.  Longer lead times, less dedication by those feeding into your core business, and poor moral resulted.  John Moody would likely be rolling in his grave if he could see what has happened to the company he built."
83,"compensation
difficult to be promoted
need to focus more on employee engagement
Groups that report into inexperienced/weak managers tend to have poor morale.  Unfortunately, Moody's does not focus on developing the interpersonal skills of their managers. There are no consequences for being a poor manager."
84,The company should focus on improving overall employee morale and engagement.
85,"- Poor compensation compared to similar work performed at the i-banks
- Promotions and advancements require a lot of time particularly for junior analysts
- Technology at the firm is below par"
86,"Communication has improved significantly since the onset of the credit crisis and needs to be maintained going forward.  Junior analysts, particularly with graduate-level degress, need to receive clear guidance regarding career advancements."
87,"Compensation is much less than competitors. If you work in a non-NYC office, you need to put in extra effort to ensure that your achievements and efforts are mentioned by those in NY, who are ultimately making the decisions on bonus and promotions. Communication by senior management leaves something to be desired, especially with important things that are related to regulatory and mandatory processes."
88,"Do not assume that employees will take whatever is thrown at them without any increase in compensation, Important changes need to be communicated better on down to analyst ranks, especially when it's a directive from senior management. It often is not the best way to communicate these things by have senior management communicating to one layer of managemnt and then on down to another layer, etc etc. Somewhere down... the line, you will get a team lead or MD who is too busy or may overlook to communicate it to his respective teams, and then you will get the breakdown in communication."
89,The work environment is not very good. Too much levels. Bonus is not dependent on the performance. Boring work now.
90,The managers should be tough sometimes. Make the work environment better. need more motivation. Be fair to employees. Generally it is ok
91,"- Can take many months or even years to go from temporary to permanent employee
- They like to hire lots of temporary employees"
92,"None at the moment really. Overall, it really is a great company to work at due to the corporate culture and environment."
93,Work load is barely manageable with very tight expense control on replacing departing staff.  Top mngt staffed by analysts (natch) and value group think rather than independent thinkers. Easy to see this in Moody's current aimlessness with new normal biz environment.  Mngt lacks varied and mkt-based business experiences to be effect and pro-active in an environment more competitive than an oligopoly.
94,"Recruit new senior management from other than career analysts, i.e., outsiders with non-traditional, forward thinking opinions and experience.  Expand the firm's footprint beyond DCM data and analysis into the broader cap mkts.  Wake up to the new reality of rating structured debt products. Change will be needed at the top three positions.  The board should look at the stock performance and prospects, then finally... get some brass under itself."
95,"Bad Payment for internship or tem staff, no healthcare and benifit, some politics that you have to learn every day."
96,would be much better if they can organize their staff better. the first thing they need to do is that to konw what the people under them are doing and how difficult their work is.
97,"-Salary
-Lack of structured training for recent employees
-Managers can be hands-off"
98,"Provide more encouragement (compensation, training, bonuses) so employee feels like he is valuable to the company."
99,Management has unlimited power. No democracy.
100,If 5 people leave department of 15 within 4 month why don’t you start an investigation?
101,"Slower pace, 9-5 workers, technology bit behind"
102,stop the reorganizations
103,"There is no hustle at Moodys and the compensation and growth opportunities are widely known as a joke - they do not exist and this is widely known on the Street.  This is an old company meaning that you must get on a long line to get true promotions leading to great growth, like 10+ years.  Most of the people here are so comfortable it has eroded many parts of the company.  Also, the IT infrastructure of the company... is beyond a joke.  Ratings analysts run this company and therefore there is an operational and company wide promotions lack of focus."
104,"Pay more, providce incentive for growth, and please find a real CIO!"
105,"Promotions are not based upon merit, but favortism.  Management has no understanding of what their staff does.  The company's overall atmosphere is a big boy's club.  Minorities are very unlikely to ever obtain senior management poistions.  Working longs hours are expected and not rewarded."
106,"Review the performance evaluation process and invest more heavily in your employees, especially the loyal ones."
107,"lack of communication between upper management and the rest of the company
lack of management responses when issues are made known - middle management under pressure to hid/voiced their own opinion
High turnover and low morale
highly intelligent middle managers but not empower to make changes. 
Unwilling to pay or recognize team for their effort"
108,get off your high horse and really listen to middle managers. You hired them because they are capable let them MANAGE. Share and communicate a clear vision of where you are heading. Staff not compensate well.
109,"The pay is sub-par to other rating agencies. Senior analysts tend to stay long-term, and therefore, there is less chance of upward movement unless portfolios of credits get reshuffled around internally."
110,"Junior analysts need to be compensated more in line with fair market value and be rewarded based on their performance for bonus. Due to lower pay, the quality of junior support will always be to a certain degree limited."
111,"~Management either doesn't know what it is managing, or is overwhelmed with duties
~Young graduates with honor degrees are as disposable and McDonald's workers
~Difficult to trust upper management to have your welfare in mind when making deals and decisions
~Upper management avoiding direct communication with junior/new employees"
112,"give clear guidelines for recent grads and younger hires to grow, or at least be able to stay with the company. It is really discouraging to be laid off at 25."
113,People are not very competitive. People are not very knowledgeable and people don't know market very well.
114,Management should hire more talented people. Make the company more competitive place to work.
115,"It is kind of boring. i wished more dynamic atmosphere. given the nature of the job, it could not be that exciting"
116,"very stable, not very fun, i ii i i i i i i i i i i i i i i"
117,"-get boring--you do the same thing every day, even if you try to work on other projects or with other teams
-there is no incentive to work really hard-- everybody moves at the same pace. Great workers promoted six months before incompetent workers."
118,Pay more so your employees will be better respected on the street.
119,Compensation has to increase to retain employees.
120,Continue doing the greate work
121,Pay is not as competitive as other financial companies.
122,"Horrible management that has no rhyme or reason for promotions, bonuses, report writing or assignments"
123,Credit crisis aftermath continues to challenge
124,Keep restoring the confidence in the firm
125,"Garbage-can management style where everything from the most important to the most mundane decisions are done on a consensus basis.  As a result, nothing is ever decided or concluded.  Managers don't take action or responsibility when they ought to do so."
126,"Allow attrition at more senior levels so as to allow new blood to improve management quality at the top.  Also this is one of the few companies in the financial services industry where there is no explicit review of the managers by junior members of the company.  There is little accountability and transparency.  Senior management is very short-sighted.  Also, limit the use of consensus-based approach when taking... strategic decisions - managers MUST decide, not leave it for everyone to have a say and not reach any conclusion."
127,"Management is non transparent, irrational, and inconsistent."
128,Learn to communicate and promote from within!

Groups are highly separated
Little vertical movement seen for the future, more outside hires come in at higher levels and promotions are hard to get... and occur once a year"
147,"Recruit your interns earlier to get a better, more competent class. Also, it's great that interns are able to talk to senior management and leadership, but middle and entry level employees should get that access too."
148,"People do not adhere to policies and procedures.  They will recognize, reward  and promote only those who the managers like while others that have dedication and high PE ratings year after year will get any recognision or reward."

Unfair promotions
Lack of transparency"
156,Link BES Survey results to managers' appraisals.  Have managers' senior managers review performance appraisals (you might learn how poorly they manage their staff). Treat junior staff fairly.
157,"Management is a joke, pay is extremely uncompetitive and cost culture trumps any achievements you may have. I would highly recommend looking elsewhere. Even if you're running laps around people, they'll find a way to give you a lower performance rating than you would otherwise garner to prevent giving larger bonus. Not just my experience, but pretty common across the board, globally. You can exceed expectations any... for 5 years and not get promoted, even at junior levels. 

Ok for a year or two out of college, or a place to let your career wind down while getting some level of pay, but that's about it."

Too many meetings."
160,Learn to operate more like a smaller company.
161,Compensation is not inline with the workload expected of Associate Analyst.  There is limited opportunity for advancement within the firm because the senior analysts tend to be less active in career movement than other financial firms.  Dealing with compliance and regulatory issues are constant hassles.
162,friendly environment Good work-life balance

Tends to create a reactionary atmosphere. There is A LOT of fat to be cut i.e. many people coast, numerous positions that perform the same job functions, impact compensation.

People call each other on the phone in neighboring offices rather than meet with them face to face.  Does not feel like a collaborative, innovative youthful company so be aware of this is you are coming from management consulting or technology.  The internal technology (mobile devices, data systems,... workflow systems, personal computers, remote work technologies etc.) are all probably 10 years behind.  I was surprised when I started at how antiquated the technology was.  There does not appear to be a lot of appetite for updating technologies so the outlook going forward remains negative. 

Culture: Moody's seems to have a very conservative business culture.  Decisions can take a long time to get made and can result in ""analysis paralysis"".

264,"The technology is a little out of date and this can cause delays in getting things done, however they are starting to improve this now."
265,No work life balance anymore
266,"The main problem is regulation and the administrative burden that comes with it and which means that you will find yourself spending 25% of your time on admin tasks (as an Associate Analyst). Also a lot of senior/lead analysts are not motivated at all. They are paid very good money for their (sometimes limited) knowledge and they seem to treat this job as a retirement holidays with business trips abroad, while being... over reliant on junior staff - on one hand this is a great opportunity to learn for juniors, on the other you may find yourself doing literally everything while the analyst is 'working from home' and signing his name under the research paper which you wrote entirely yourself (again though this depends on the team and sometimes you have those teams where the senior/lead analysts do everything while you just update excel data, which must be extremely boring). In my case it was very demotivating. IT systems are also terrible so you will often not be able to work smoothly, and I will not even discuss how unintuitive they are.

If you are a lead/senior analyst I see very limited number of cons as you can largely dictate your own pace of work, delegate boring/low-value adding tasks to juniors who are assigned to you, have limited responsibility as it is always the 'cttee decision', so if money is ok I would always go for it."
267,Stop getting involved in influencing rating outcomes and rating assignments - your job is to manage people and create teams of individuals who can handle it (hiring in the banking department those who failed in structured finance after the crisis is NOT the way to go).

Generally, for all the decisions a VP can't find the explanations there is a usual ""this is the professional opinion of our analysts"" answer. Behind this generic phrase often lack of understanding and basis for decisions. A... lot of bureaucracy.

278,"I've never come across an organization which is so needlessly political. I think the company could give many investment banks a run for their money when it comes to internal politics. The nature of the credit committee process also fosters an environment of criticism and one-upmanship which doesn't help.

326,It would be helpful to be more inclusive. Staff should be encouraged to 'mingle' more often.

Loyalty (lack of opportunity) is rewarded with promotions. These leftovers control the place, add to cost, create nuisance as they get fancy job titles
They are in low-end business, laggards amongst peers, but still very arrogant towards employees due to opportunistic behaviour.

Technology is really outdated and you spent enormous amount of time dealing with IT problems. Very much hierarchical.

Free up MD time for subordinates."
375,"Human Resources took forever to get back to me and the screening process if ridiculously long. Also, the culture -- ohh, the culture -- maybe it's because I worked in credit analysis (on the sale side) it was actually for Moody's Analytics but the people could not be more mundane and socializing was not encouraged. When it was, it was not exactly genuine."
376,Typical bureaucracy where much of your success will depend on which influential people you know who are willing to spend their capital on supporting promoting you.  Office politics often impede best decisions.

Those preparing the ratings have to deal with a higher pressure environment when you factor in the unpredictability of your workload (transactions pop up out of nowhere), compliance breathing down your neck (they monitor everything you do), communicating externally with investors and issuers (they hate you when you downgrade... them, sorry?), constantly dealing with IT issues, and the never ending revolver door of people leaving for higher paying jobs at banks.  The turnover rate for associate analysts in 2014 was especially high (40%) for a good reason.  People with ambition who can do this job well are in high demand at banks for much higher compensation.  If you're doing this to just work 2 years and then jump to a bank, then it might make sense, otherwise just go straight to the banks if you can. 

People will be frustrated by the lack of raises (less than 2% per year!)."
433,"Only the stock price matters (only VP and above are granted equity).  The turnover issue will never go away, and those who stay have to pick up the slack (I've had to cover for three senior analysts while waiting for replacement hires!).  This is quite common on most teams. I expect ratings quality/timeliness to decline as a result.  S&P and Fitch are already closing the gap and even surpassing us in some areas... according to management."
434,COMPANY LAY OFF LONG TIME EMPLOYEE MASSIVELY FOR SEVERAL YEARS
435,"Disorganized, and highly inefficient with too many meetings"
436,"Horrible IT support, overall conservative environment means new initiatives take a long time to get off the ground"
437,"Comp is low, even after adjusting for work / life balance; hourglass structure limits advancement for seasoned junior employees"
438,"Technology Senior Management is non existent. There was no good leader who can make the right   decision and lead by example. At the time I was there Geoff Fite who was CTO of San Franicsco branch showed no leadership and basic knowledge of Silicon Valley latest technologies. His lack of leadership and management style was root cause of my decision to quit this place. I would never recommend anybody even consider... this place . Don't read reviews full of joy etc, most of them are done by junior people who have not seen better places in their work experience."
439,San Francisco based Senior Technology Management starting with CTO and all Directors should be fired and the new fresh blood should come in and turn this place around.
440,The promotion track is very slow.  The difference between positions is very minimal. Once you hit a certain point you won't be doing many different things.  The bonus is very low even in a good year
441,Please consider bonus allocations a bit more.  Some depts work many more hours and don't receive larger bonuses.  Thanks!
442,Regulatory and compliance requirements can be tedious. There are constant requirements on training while some can be cumbersome. Management is tight on cost control

448,"It is a good place to learn and gain experience. However, they have some areas of improvement in terms of the recruiting process, work/life balance and not enough benefits in comparison to the rest of the global companies in the industry."
449,"The worst recruiting process ever!
I went thru a lot of interviews. Their offer came 5 months after the first interview. 
They do not provide regular updates during the recruiting process. They are not 100% transparent because the keep changing the information provided to the candidates regarding the role and responsibilities. They make offerings during the recruiting process that they will not be able to give, or... that they are not 100% sure because it is the client’s call."
450,Some people are not good but would not get fired
451,Some people can get stuck without a promotion or raise for years; people tend to get very silo'd in what they're doing
452,"Plenty of people had warned me about Moodys, but I didn't realize it would be that bad.  The company was well known as a bottom feeder for technology for decades before things came to a head with their debacle helping cause the 2008 financial crisis.  They have since tried to bring their IT up to basic standards but have been using the same incompetent middle managers that got them in the mess in the first place,... with predictable disastrous results.  They churn through consultants and flog those that are visa slaves to death.  I've witnessed a consultant having their ID removed and on investigating finding out they were being let go on the same day.  Professional courtesy doesn't not extend to how consultants are treated.

457,heavily regulated and large amount of administrative tasks
458,"At its worst, your manager will wash their hands of you while you are drowned by compliance demands that cannot be filled due to insufficient technology.

Clearly you will not get promoted that quickly at an agency unless you are lucky and your seniors leave for other positions externally. When this happens it can mean that the worst analysts end up acting as bottlenecks in the company, though not always, as often... they are found out and are moved to a non analytic position. 

Compliance seem to go out of their way to be slow and unhelpful when needed to give an opinion, but very quick to decide an infringement has been made, their culture is not helpful to the organisation and, in the end, counter productive."
459,"Still some strains of the them and us culture between management and non-management. Management need to take more time to understand the implications of regulations and how difficult they can be to manage along with analytic work, especially given the very visible limitations in technology. It is frustrating when when management criticise their reports when there is very little support or badly designed support  for... analysts to help them comply with hundreds of new rules they need to consider."
460,Business heavily driven by compliance

464,Speed up decision making; make mistakes more quickly and recover. Every decision can't be perfect - so don't try for perfection when it doesn't exist.
465,Senior management have too many responsibilities and often are too removed from the specifics of particular business problems. Difficult to get promoted on merits alone - department quotas have precedence. New hires are brought in at higher job titles than experienced existing employees with similar experience.
466,Look for ways to retain skilled employees - lots of smart people leave over slow pace of promotion and slim salary increases.
467,"1. Huge amount of administrative work.
2. Decisions by senior management often seems detached from the experiences of the workers.
3. Promotion criteria mysterious."
468,More feedback from workers when implementing processes and when making promotions. Streamline middle office processes to remove duplicate work and reduce administrative burden.
469,"1. Information Systems: Work/Life is non-existent.
2. HR department is untrustworthy.
3. Software and Hardware is under-par with other financial companies."
470,"Moody's strenght has always been from its #1 asset, dedicated employees. Your current management team (especially IT management) lacks that core value. The amount of deliverables committed to business management does not match the current staffing levels. This has resulted in unsatisfied customers and burnt-out staff. I hope this improves for the current and future employees."

477,Promotion criteria is not always objective
478,"HR is a nightmare!  The turnover is unbelievable due to toxic leadership and some truly frightening characters.  The entire department is a risk for the company and no one cares to fix it, ironic given Moody's business model.  So many great people leave because of abusive managers, who are then rewarded with VP, SVP titles and complimentary coaching.  Very unfortunate."
479,"If you see 100% turnover it's time to walk the manager to the door.  If you let it happen twice, consider yourself lucky that you don't have a class-action lawsuit, yet.  It’s a great company, help it by reacting to what you see and hear.  It's load and clear."
480,The company is not good with Work Flexibility
481,Don't have much to say.
482,Progression as an associate analyst can be slow.
483,"Annual merit increases (annual pay-rises) are typically steady but fairly modest even when the company performs well. In my experience, the increase rates don't differ very significantly whether you are top performer or your contribution is average. Opportunities for internal mobility (functional / geographic) are limited in Shared Services."
484,Compensation lower than banks leading to high turnover when banks going on a hiring spree to build their teams. due to increasing rules and regs there is a growing administrative and compliance component that can be tedious.
485,Management is relatively transparent and communicative. They should continue to invest in the education and training of their employees.
486,Upper management is the worst.

501,Salary isn't on par with an investment bank
502,"More transparency around budgeting, salary bands, clarity for promotion process"
503,"Titles are not in sync with the rest of the financial industry and can be misleading.  You really have to earn your stripes here to get an officer title.   For e.g. an Assistant Vice President here is considered a very senior position, equivalent to a director or vice president outside of the organization.    While other financial banks sort of give away officer titles (a dime a dozen in some banks) it is based on... performance, accomplishments, seniority and other metrics at Moody's.  Every metric is ranked by the book!

Moody's Analytics goes by different titles all together.  An Associate Director to Director is the range of an Assistant Vice President at Moody's Investor Services division.

Many analysts have their own offices - because many conversations with issuers discuss non-public information - which leads to a less-personal environment."

529,"Lack of upward mobility, low salaries"
530,"I would like to reiterate then post by another HR employee on July 31, 2015.   Beware!!!   The HR organization is a dysfunctional nightmare!  “Leadership” is a laughing stock and the organization is toxic and disorganized.   Getting ahead is impossible - no matter how hard you work.  There are quite obviously “golden children” who have been assigned to high ranking positions in the recent HR restructure (merit??). ... Many of these individuals have been imported, at presumably great expense, to take the place of hard working Americans with experience, years of recognition and merit.  At the same time, the costs associated with these employees appears to have drained the budget - in so much as there is nothing left to incentivize most workers or improve/ upgrade their conditions.  You can make WAY more elsewhere with a more respectable and skilled Management team and incentive program."

578,Not much to say to the management. The managers I have dealt with have been very knowledgeable and helpful
579,"You are at the whim of who you work for. I worked for a guy who was very knowledgeable but not very nice to me. He made my life miserable and decided to replace me with someone with less experience. I was pretty experienced for the role and probably should've been hired into a higher role. the training tends to be on the job, but they analysts are often too busy to train you properly, so you have to pick up certain... skills from reading prior reports or the rating methodologies. Hopefully, you were formally credit trained before you got there."
580,"I believe the managers were reprimanded because they were in part responsible for the financial crisis. They rTed debt in an unregulated market the same way as in a regulated one; when issuers asked how they could improve their rating, they told them to issue or get into the Mortgage backed or asset backed securities market! That is bad advice, but it benefits Moody's bottom line because they get paid handsomely to... rate those securities. It became a ""racket"".  Anyway, Moody's makes money hand over fist, they have very high profit margins, so senior management tends to be very arrogant as displayed ungraciously during the Senatorial hearings in 2009, after the financial crisis. No, Ray McDaniel, you did not make us current and former employees proud of the company by your display.  He was ungracious and did not act with respect as appropriate for the role. He was unseasoned and immature (as is most of the management there)' unlike the CEO of S&P, Moody's equal competitor who was very gracious.  I believe that you should give people a second chance and learn from your mistakes. The company can be sexist and racists against blacks and Latins. It is heavily Asian these days and leans that way. It would be better to diversify the employees and to offer proper training"

Since business is too market driven, which affects your overall performance and target achievements which impacts your bonus a lot. You will not receive a penny when you'd have invested all of your self but since market didn't perform so even you lost it.... Company promises a lot but delivers really less. No HR engagement at all."
593,Not always as nimble or progressive as the company could/should be in terms of technology.
594,Allow acquired companies more time to transition to Moody's processes and systems before integrating. Acquisitions are really taxing on everyone - both sides - involved and that is only harder when it's rushed.
595,It is difficult to get promoted and the salary is lower relative to the market.
596,"Micro-management, depending on the team you are in. Lack of proper communication for what concerns tasks and duties. Protocols can take up a great amount of your time. No recognition of merit. Great frustration when it comes to communicate issues, as if you actually created them instead of flagging them up to improve working conditions. Politics, politics, politics."
597,Be clear regarding what is expected. Communicate clearly and provide feedback.

Top heavy management structure. Too many managers handling 4-5 member projects. Hence difficult to promote employees.
Management introduced internal certifications based on promotions are made. If you fail to clear these certifications, management will defer your promotion.
Managers are... interested in improving their own margins and hence don't mind stealing employee bonuses to make up their margins"
614,Least employee oriented strategies will help you save money in the short term but spoil your reputation in the market.
615,Falta de recursos por ser uma empresa pequena aqui no Brasil e o escritória depende muito da sede em NYC.
616,"Administrative Employees are considered Non-Exempt status, so reporting hours are necessary. They are overtime eligible, but it is discouraged and limited, so you can't depend that to significantly add to your base. Also bonuses for non-exempt employees amount to an extra paycheck at the end of the year, and are dependent upon the market, so some years you may not get a bonus."
617,"As overtime is highly discouraged within departments, it erases the benefits of being classified as non-exempt employees. It may be better to convert administrative positions to straight salary."

626,Can be long hours at times
627,Moody's severely underpays in terms of both base compensation as well as bonuses. This has been an issue for a while and does not seem to be changing anytime soon.
628,My advice to management would be that the company needs to invest more in its associate analyst pool and change the way in which it compensates. There needs to be more incentive for strong performance.
629,Large barriers for growth. Position is not valued in the whole of the organization
630,"Non commercial environment where rewards are by no means linked to performance or analytical contribution.
 The status quo (promoted by management) is the message to follow for progression. Associates are rewarded for agreeing with the consensus. After all, management's subjectively rewards without any performance measure being considered"

648,"The Bad: Then there is the HR Department. In a company that employees are genuinely proud to be a part of, the morale in this group is abysmal. These are the people who run the employee engagement survey and spend a lot of manpower to find ways to retain the best talent, while their own employees leave in droves for better jobs. There have been several occasions when employees have left without another job waiting... for them.

 The Ugly:  the Leadership & Organizational Development group, since there is no leadership or organization at the top of the department. In the past few years there has been a nearly 100% turnover. That is unacceptable.

I single out L&OD because the senior leaders, who are the key drivers of the Employee Value Proposition, seem to live by the mantra, ""Our views matter. Yours do when they mirror ours."" The senior leadership is rewarded for implementing early 21st Century ideas to enhance L&OD, meanwhile sucking up valuable resources by taking leadership training instead of providing that training to someone who could actually benefit from it. Incompetence and lack of communication skills are rewarded, hence the turnover.

Lots of overcomplicating processes, many of which result in ""hurry up and wait"" situations (but there is still a dearth of necessary processes...).  Little penalization for not meeting deadlines many arbitrarily set deadlines but no reward for meeting such deadlines.  As a result, progress is highly superficial.  Middle-management likes to... make it look as though there has been change when little no none has actually taken place.
It feels as though this job is a means to an end for most management... some padding of the resume so that they can move on to the next company."
661,"Work on simple, long-term solutions that can withstand the test of time.  If you have to wait until next quarter, wait until next quarter... don't institute an inefficient/unnecessary/illogical/redundant policy and then tell us it's a step forward just so that you can go to your boss and say that you got something done.

There’s too much political jockeying and back stabbing at the senior level that only... serves to distract the troops from what’s important. The blame culture and throwing juniors under the bus (BSD and Infra) deprives Moody’s of staff loyalty as everyone is constantly keeping an eye out for being backstabbed by a colleague or an MD. Honesty needs to be valued more and rewarded instead of being shouted down as not being a team player. Moody’s needs to allow for a more collegial atmosphere so that people can deliver on great ideas and be less competitive (in a bad way) with each other."
881,Low salary and not a lot of opportunities for advancement
882,"There is nothing “Technical” about this role. Its basic 1st line/hardware support/customer service. Nothing much to learn, lots of monitor deployments to waste your time with. The systems engineering team have no presence outside of NY and don’t provide anything helpful anyway in terms of technology or tools. 

Several third party vendors that carry out tasks at a very granular level so difficult to find the right... person. Support from most of those vendors is terrible, they simply don’t care. They have finally decided to streamline and bring in one to take over at least three of those companies so maybe things will improve. 

People will ignore your emails, including senior management. You have to CC in someone important if you need support from people or for them to simply do their actual job.

I suggested many improvements but kept getting  knock-backs. Senior people came up with excuses probably because they were protecting their highly paid positions. 

The only projects you are asked to get involved with are the ones that nobody else wants to do. You’re not asked what you’d like to do. Many broken processes which can create chaos for users.  

In term of progression it is non-existent unless you are already in a senior role or if you are very young and seen to have potential. You can’t be in your thirties and have potential or existing talent. 

Also how about some regular department drinks once in a while rather then only if a senior person from the US comes over with their credit card. Not much team bonding."
883,"The MIT University was a great idea and gave an excellent high level understanding to many functions but the company will not entrust you to get involved with any of these so seems pointless. If there is a particular path you enjoy or technology you like to get involved there is no clear guidance on how to get involved. 
So you can ask around till you find the right names and they either ignore you or fob you off... to a subordinate. You’re not encouraged to take your learning further. You can even offer to stay back and work extra hours to help out those teams but they won’t bother making use of your existing skills or talents. 
The available roles that are advertised are usually quite senior and you could never acquire the required skills from doing the TSA jobs due to lack of systems access/permissions. So they bring new people in and usually to the NY office. Why don’t you train people from within the organisation. How about a quarterly meeting for MIT to give an idea of what roles might be coming and giving staff an opportunity to ask questions and put their names forward for development into those roles."
884,Career growth  which is very less
885,not as such only thing is progression
886,- bad salary progression and even worse bonus. The entry level salary for an associate analyst is decent in London but the bonus is very low (I'm talking 1.8k after taxes kind of bonus). Salary progression is really bad. It doesn't really get better unles
887,"Pay more, simple. In the financial industry you attract motivated people only when the overall package is right. Right now the average Associate Analyst stays for 1.5 years and then leaves. That's not normal! There is just no incentive to stay any longer than that because progression is slow and salary is below average. It seems like most of the people that do stay for much longer are usually the less ambitious ones.... So retaining the top talent needs to be priority!"
888,"Some people take the compliance and regulatory issues too seriously 
Depending on your security clearance you will have to sell all of your industry specific stocks
As with any job that is market based, can be overwhelming at times and underwhelming at other times"
889,Implement casual fridays!!
890,There is no room for internal mobility nor professional development. Compensation is on the lower end. High turnover rate.

895,bad management and poor communication.
896,give your employees more autonomy - stop micro managing.
897,"Analysts spend about 50% time on compliance related works. While everyone can have different views, some senior management have a strong and dominant view. Very tedious works sometimes,"
898,Upgrade systems to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Improve HR and health plan (HR stops insurance coverage when employees take unpaid leaves to take care of sick dependents)
899,Not much room for growth or advancement

908,"Remuneration and benefits are not great (though not terrible either)
Office and facilities are a bit shabby and cramped
Slow progression
Tough regulatory environment"
909,"While I like what Ray and the board are doing, some members in higher positions, i am not a fan of and question how they got there (or why they are still there).  A con for me but if you are friends with the right person or liked by the right person, you will have a much easier time moving up or going anywhere in the company. On the flip side, if you are not friends with the right person, it can be an arduous... journey. While not necessarily in silos, it seems like every team has a different set of rules on how they can or cannot move up the corporate ladder.

While most of the people here are very talented, sometimes, it can be a real struggle to get anything accomplished. Meetings for days. What do you think about (fill in the blank)?, lets have a 30 minute meeting to discuss."
910,"on a seperate work stream (not in PE's), regularly evaluate VPs and higher. Additionally, create a survey or effort to regularly gauge teams abilities to work with other teams, and how they score on working with other teams.

Get rid of the ambiguity behind promotions or advancement."

916,Working hours depend on your team and boss
917,Work tends to stretch which in turn leads to long working hours. Seems to lack transparency in the current set up
918,Employee retention along side client retention and growth should be a balanced approach for future growth and success
919,"If you stay in your position for longer than a few years without a promotion, your chances of promotion or being interviewed for other positions within the company are non existent

936,"HR transformation 2014 was a disaster, high turnover and poor, non-transparent leaders who did not understand the value of retaining HR talent. Politics at play, nobody was told why people were being “let go”, toxic individuals — extremely bad environment that made good people leave. I’ve heard things didn’t exactly get better after."
937,"For such a well-branded global firm, key parts of HR were embarrassingly poorly run in terms of basic management and treatment of employees . I was shocked and saddened at the negative culture. I hope lessons have been learned the past few years, and the necessary improvements made. The HR work culture needs to be improved. I know you there is the leadership talent to do it. Good luck."

943,salary payout is so so
944,"work life balance, time off"
945,A lot of meetings because we want everyone to have a say.
946,some politics to manage at headquarters
947,"Like most large places, very political to move up. The company used to have the people you actually work with have more say in your advancement, but recently, the company introduced middle managers who don't see/understand your work as much, but have a large say in your advancement, so sucking up matters way more than performance.
Also, due to poor management of handling regulatory compliance, there are teams of... people who exist to try and catch you not checking the right box so you can get your bonus taken away. It never happened to me, but it did to people I know and living in fear of the compliance cops isn't fun. Also, lots of lifers work here, so get used to unintentional caps lock and constant whining about how they don't understand the electric typing box."
948,"The middle managers are pointless, compliance checkers create a culture of fear, you spend way too much on rent when you should have people work at home more like your competitors do (cough, s&p), and you're not that progressive so please top telling us that you are when the composition of your c suite and board looks like any other old fortune 500. Thank you for the pay adjustment though to pay market rates. I... liked that."
949,"Low salaries and very low bonuses, especially for most junior staff. Work is very similar to investment banking junior roles, but for less pay. Poor career progression. Some people don't make it to VP after 10 years and retire before they become MDs.

Extreme forced diversity campaigns - you will be forced to attend 2 diversity events a year and you will be spammed with forced diversity e-mails without the option... to unsubscribe.

MDs couldn't care less about junior staff and more focus on how to be friends with other MDs.

Juniors are not respected and are under constant threat of replacement with India offshoring or/and job automation."
950,Stop focusing so much on the outsourcing and focus on hiring best talent instead. Reduce executive compensation. Think long-term rather than quarterly.
951,"No work life balance , but I realize that depends on the department you work in. Being in a shared service environment you would think we wouldn’t work long hours and unnecessary hours at that."
952,Not sure how you have receive the working mother’s award when flexibility and work life balance doesn’t apply to people below VP.
953,"- Very High Turnover

955,"Compensation below median
Progression is limited"
956,"no cons,no cons, no cons"
957,"Days can get pretty boring (depending on who/what team one is supporting), not a lot of career mobility. There are a few admins here who have gone on to other roles within the company, but for the most part this is the perfect job for those who just want a stable job that pays for their lives outside the office - family, vacation, hobbies, etc. Not the place to make tons of money and work your way up the ladder."
958,"Pay more attention to administrative assistants - associate analysts, mid-level women have programs designed to move them up the career ladder, please do something similar for admins that don't want to be pigeonholed into one thing."

975,My advice won't matter. The company is comparable to a giant dinosaur that'll continue to chug along
976,Decision making can be slow at times
977,"Depends on which group you work in... Shared Services area is managed by senior management  only interested in empire building... if you are working in Transformation project area, forget about work-life balance... project mismanagement will ensure you work like a dog... if you work in Operations area, you will not have enough resources to deliver quality product or service..."
978,"Executive management should ensure that senior management actually follow up on cultural values involving inter team collaboration... 

Not aligning bottom line goals with cultural values professed will result in bottom line goals corrupting cultural values... Corporate culture is what you do, not what you say..."
979,No program or product strategy on any key transformation projects. Senior managers only like yes men. The work environment is very toxic
980,There is a lot of talent in the company that is under utilized. Listen to people who you disagree with  too.
981,Changing corporate culture as company grows.

987,"Not much to learn, No clear career path"
988,Desire of wishful role could be a dilemma.
989,"Upward movement is extremely limited, promotions are not earned and given they are applied for. Communication from superiors is very fragmented and it seems the position is either getting left behind or replaced. You will pigeon-hole yourself if you take a role as an FDA. Skills are not very transferable and management is not very motivating. Superiors do not have the highest level of educational background either.... Moody's is the little brother of the financial services industry that banks are forced to play with due to the government. 401k Matching program is weak as is the Stock Purchase plan...does not compete with other similar firms."

Some people have been here very long time so the culture is stuck. Communication is poor within and across departments. This impacts US but also when trying to work with global workforce and offshore teams.  Managers can be unnecessarily tough on staff (as others commented). There is... more than average amount of petty complaining and office politics."

1007,"They separated moody's rating team into rating research and rating support. And rating support think of themselves as separate entity and want to keep junior analysts there as long as possible after they are trained- while the ideal path for those analysts are to move into rating teams. Those analysts need to ""look for new jobs"" instead of being promoted into rating team. Lots of talents left because this system is... ridiculous."

Embarrassing salary, no bonuses. No career opportunities due to shortage of employees in the bottom of the chain, so Moody's will keep you there until you quit. Work life balance nonexistent if you actually want to perform all... your daily tasks. Nonexistent opportunities of growth.

People will not get rich there - you might not even afford to live in Manhattan. Company moral is not strong right now."
1085,"It is not a particularly challenging environment because it is very bureaucratic and new ideas/changes are not often welcomed. Risk doesn't seem to be something the firm operationally mitigates , but rather tries to avoid all together. Not a great formula for strategic growth by any means."
1086,"The technology-- computer systems-- are subpar and they can't seem to fix that. e.g. The help desk has recently been outsourced and people report long waits to get help. Or Blackberries arrived at Moody's years after every one else had them. Also, management has a hard time prioritizing which means that analysts can be overwhelmed. They are also going through a transition given all of the negative press and transitions in general are hard. Finally, while the salaries are decent, they are below those of IBankers and Bond INsurers and as a result there is more turnover than there should be."

1091,"Lack of career direction, growth and planning. There's no where to go, unless your boss is outplaced or leaves."
1092,"Very New York-centric, which can cause resentment outside of US. The company has grown extremely rapidly in the past few years, and this can create a chaotic feel in the way the corporation presents itself to the world.

Projects aren't always managed effectively to completion, partly because of the rapid growth just mentioned, but also sometimes due of a lack of focus from senior management.

Increasing regulatory focus on credit agencies means the company will face a very difficult couple of years ahead, as it tries to justify it's place and function in the markets."
