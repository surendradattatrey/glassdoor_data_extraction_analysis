Work/life balance
Affords great experience in energy fundamentals market - this job is a launchpad, not a career though","Pay is very low, raises hardly keep pace with inflation - promotions bring little monetary value, no incentive to work harder and longer hours
Feedback from (some) managers is almost nonexistent 
Management seems to have little direction, akin to a rudderless ship
Entrepreneurial spirit is encouraged but things take forever to get done
Slow decision making process, bureaucratic 
Little upward mobility unless someone leaves, which has become less frequent
Management plays favorites","Stop trying to grow the company with no clear direction while mobility and opportunity languish below the executive level. Pay your employees more to inspire some motivation, the money is borderline insulting for what some people are capable of there. Decide if you want to train analysts to move on, or develop them there and provide opportunities. Lastly, town halls and company speak revolved around automating things, taking the people out of the process - this is not exactly motivating language. Thankfully, initiatives in this vein that were discussed in 2016 and 2017 still have not come to fruition and still seem a long way off.","Great people, no direction from management",

-Good work life balance","- limited progression
- in the beginning, there's lots to learn and people seem reasonably smart
-past a year, and you realise that this company absolutely cannot innovate, particularly because it is filled with senior leadership who have been there for years and are more interested in securing their position and surrounding themselves with a group of friends, rather than hiring or nurturing genuinely competent people. Having done their time, they now sit around making decisions from the London office that often do not make any sense for fast moving commodity markets. Additionally, for many of these markets, Asia is where you see all the action. However, many major decisions for Asia are made in London by people who have no understanding of the nuances of these markets or how these Asian commodity markets work. Nonetheless, top down decisions are carried out, regardless of market or employee feedback. 
- The culture is tense and many people keep to themselves, intent on carrying out their jobs without scrutiny.
-There is a culture of hiring managers who have connections with leadership, but often have insufficient competence for the job. This is part of the organizational rot that is eating away at this company. This leads to the next point. 
- Bullying and micromanagement is common across many teams, and little has been done to remedy it. Bullying managers are kept on, and shuffled on to other roles (Catholic priest-style) in the organisation.","- Stop being complacent, make yourself genuinely accessible to ground level staff.
- dare to take bad leaders to action
- stop treating employees like commodities
- have a competent HR function
- actually hire competent leaders and let them shake things up
- value industry feedback and stop being hellbent monetization, focus on the product",Needlessly political,"Thank you for your review. At S&amp;P Global, our people come first. We are happy to hear that our improved practices and benefits have made a difference! 

As a global company with team members all over the globe, we are all committed to developing both our managers and team members to foster a positive and inclusive work environment where success is seen at all levels of our organization globally.

This creates an adversarial atmosphere between clients and sales and when the client cancels (and they will), you the sales group are charged back for these losses regardless of which person sold it.  There is no way an ethical person could work for S&amp;P and someone should replace them and put this firm out of business permanently.  Come on Google put this together and add new content, pricing and structure to the energy and commodity markets .",Come clean and stop cheating your sales teams and  clients alike.

S&P Global Platts,http://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Employee-Review-S-and-P-Global-Platts-RVW23600817.htm,Associate,2018-11-28,Singapore, ,Singapore,No,More than a year,Full-time,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,Staying the Same,No,No Rating,"1. Excellent benefits and salary given the amount of work you do you - very much overpaid -  If you are interested in the media/journalism industry, or are seeking to retire / have other priorities over a career and can deal with the cons below.  
2. Sales colleague makes really good poke, best in Singapore.","1. Extremely political like previous reviews have said.  Especially so in the editorial department as there is no focus on PNL and the work doesn't take up too much time so people try to get ahead Game of Thrones style. 
2. Mostly mediocre management that managed to get to their position via above politics thereby are more focused on maintaining their position and image than actually managing well.
3. High turnover -  can be likened to the latest Marvel avengers movie, a snap of the fingers and half of (some) teams are wiped out (quit). My ex-team of under 15 people averaged close to one leaver a month when I was there. To be fair, some teams are better than others in terms of culture and management - unfortunately, the teams to avoid are naturally the ones who constantly have openings. 
4. Limited career opportunities outside of media industry. Please don't mistake this as a good entry point into the commodities industry - you are more likely to be pigeonholed as a journalist the longer you stay.", ,Only If you want to be in the media/journalism/retiring NOT commodities,

- Lifers here who stay for more than 10+ years. Y? Because S&amp;P Global pays you a generous reward if you stay until then
- If you are the eye of the apple, you can raise fast","- Political environment and culture. If no1 likes you, you better start saying your prayers
- Managers look after managers and throw you under the bus, just to stay secure in their jobs
- Those who are there long, per the above pros. but inherently everyone is unmotivated by the sudden shift into how political S&amp;P Global has become",Problem starts at the very top down to the lowest managers.,"If you get a Call from S&amp;P, reject unless you are desperate",

Lots of smart, dedicated professionals doing their best to put out quality content and analysis. Benchmark prices are a bread &amp; butter moneymaker (like bond ratings is for S&amp;P) Some groups that were  gobbled up by Platts  were the gold standard in their specific markets (Bentek for NA Nat Gas, PIRA for global oil). Average  levels as far as benefits / resources / perks go.","Well below average pay compared to similar size companies, especially compared to the Wall st side or the actual industry side. This leads to heavy turnover and generally low morale among the core.  Platts' strategy with their merger spree was to buy first, ask questions later. Between Bentek, PIRA, RigData, SNL (and a few others), there is A LOT of overlap within the company. Many groups have competing products, leading to even more uncertainty and confusion, which management is not usually helpful in addressing. (They are cleaning up the mess of the previous merger or looking to the next one). This all leads to very limited upside  for new entrants. Stay for a year or two and absorb all the knowledge you can from all their content, then take that someplace where its actually valued.","Most of the damage is probably already done as far as the M&amp;A goes.  Be clear with people about the future of their group. Time to step it up with competitive pay for top analysts, writers, and other performers. Forget the billion dollar buybacks and your precious branding and focus on investing in your best asset: The people on the ground who actually make it all happen.",Meager Money in a Merger Mess,

Just don't expect to be rewarded for it.","The editorial organization reeks of nepotism. A tight-knit group of (mainly) white folks in London keeps control of the editorial organization by picking political appointees in teams across the world--a clear signal to everyone else that meritocracy isn't rewarded here. It's great going if you're a loyal member of this influential group, as you can move around the world and get any job you want.

You might learn how to be a journalist too. For editorial staff it is a v important role in the market place that can give access to senior figures. Solid on the CV, but only if you want to be a junior analyst in Switzerland at a commodity trading house or work for a competitor. If you are lucky you get in to an exchange.  You do make friends for life though. A good place to start your career and certainly no easier sales place to be than here. Big marketing budget.","Bureaucracy - layers of it and no one understands the roles, rules or functions. Compliance functions staffed with people that (mostly) have no experience of the business and haven't done the job (apologise to those that have). Get them working a content job to understand the pressure and pain of systems they design.
Content - front line roles have no sense of meaning, autonomy and the compliance rules mean staff are treated like children. Necessary for compliance? It may be, but it doesn't feel like it is YOUR job. Millennials will find this the hardest bit as Platts' graduate recruitment plan shows.
Strategy - sales strategy is to exercise Platts' power in a de facto monopoly. Client base for price reports is going down. So the general practice has been to squeeze the biggest clients for more money and offer them some analytics or price reports they don't need. This creates client distaste for the organisation as many many people have commented on here.  Great for shareholders. Not great for customer facing roles. Only going to get worse as sales try and force Analytics offerings that the company has purchased  down Platts' clients throats. 
Product management - paralysed. Haven't launched a new revenue-generating product for years and the technology from the companies that were bought was left to wither on the vine. Generally they are hamstrung by a decision-making process that no one understands and crippled by fear of losing revenue.
Marketing - Excellent, but (as noted by many in the organisation) they end up marketing products the company doesn't sell. That's because the products the company does sell (PDFs) look dreary.
Management - Micromanagement is high with senior to middle managers left with little authority bar being a conduit for minor decisions(big decisions don't get made). Too many times do people ask for guidance only for managers to kick decisions upstairs. There is an uncomfortable succession-planning process where every employee is rated on an overly simplistic scale of 1-4. Managers with little knowledge of employees often have a big say in a rating process that can harm careers long after that manager has departed. Feels underhand. Ask your manager what yours is if you work there.
Career prospects - Like any corporate beast it is good if you pick up the lingo, curry favour and don't challenge the status quo.  Listening to the colourful tall stories farmed out by senior management, (which I guess is meant to be inspirational) can be torturous though so a rhino skin and a sense of humour is important.
Culture - too many people with not enough work to do in some areas leads to gossip and office politics. As many have noted in here, the politics is really really bad. That's partly due to a complicated reporting line structure that very few people understand and causes distraction.","Get a management consultancy in to tell some hard truths. Hire people who are experts in compliance to minimalise the impact of pending regulation.  Try hiring managers that have had success in their careers at other places. Ask yourself - do we really need all this staff that don't really produce content, sell it or market it?",Bloated & paralysed with an odd corp. culture,

Projects left to drift, with no one stepping in, culling the project leadership and starting afresh. No brave new blood, rather a rehash of ineffectual middle management muddling along in the vain hope they will be able to deliver something, someday, somewhen.","Be brave.  When you see a ship steering off course, challenge that Captain of the ship.   Ask them why they have under delivered against what they have committed to deliver.

All in all it was a good job at a good place and clearly the market leader in its limited field.,Apart from the occasional repetitiveness the main bad point was with a group manager who I found to be somewhat dishonest. This person was a good speaker and leader but clearly making up big parts of their life story like being in the army when they obviously wasn't or stuff like being a sports coach when it was very unlikely! Their story would change so often that I lost faith in the leadership and it was part of the reason I started to look at other roles.

And it works as most of my ex-colleagues who are smart enough to qualify working in a trading house were dissuaded by the pay cut from jumping onto a trade support role. 

Loads of opportunity to network and travel or to speak in conferences. 

You also learn a lot from the sources in the industry and also from the Managing Editors/seniors who can be knowledgeable. This is the case in Singapore at least. 

I think the most valuable for me is learning about the energy pricing, trade flows, economics, and other factors that energy traders care about the most.

A major pro is that, by conducting analysis, primary research and due diligence, reporters generate relevant content and it's not something insubstantial - there's a reason why analysts and brokers copy these articles in their internal reports after all. Information gathering is a relevant skill and is one thing that the industry sadly overlooks when they see a Platts reporter. 

The managers are encouraging and nurturing, and will ensure that you get the proper training before you represent the company in the industry.

The job is not for the faint-hearted and is thus a good character-building experience - you can encounter objections (sometimes nasty confrontations) on your price assessments.","As a reporter, it was tough for my hard work to be appreciated by the industry if the pricing methodology is somewhat flawed - not that there's a viable or robust substitute in the first place anyway.

There's also a growing lack of confidence from external sources on the quality of reporters who have become complacent after benchmark status of their product has been fully established.

The learning curve can be truncated by the nature of the market you're covering. Sources share information in so far as it benefits them. In some (or most?) markets, opacity is money and this is the case where there's limited opportunity for learning. 

It is a news organization and so (1) it can be very stressful on certain days when something major happens, and (2) relationships within are the core and the people who are not necessarily capable but are good in talking BS and sucking up to management can get very very far. As with huge organizations, relationships are key and the politics can be bad. 

Turnover is high (at least in Singapore) because a lot of recruits who are not necessarily with journalistic background/flair wish to join, or are probably even better within the commercial world instead of writing news.

It can become a bit dull to write about the record high price in three months and other irrelevant news angling for the sake of hitting a news target in a week. Anyone who didn't aim to be a journalist can be quickly dissatisfied.","Do not misrepresent the job like it's a stepping stone to the trading world - because it is not.
