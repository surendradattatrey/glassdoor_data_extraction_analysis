"S&P Dow Jones Indices, LLC",http://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Employee-Review-S-and-P-Dow-Jones-Indices-RVW27832932.htm,Senior Index Manager,2019-07-06,New York,New York State,US,No,Less than a year,Full-time,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Getting Worse,No,No Opinion,"Company Benefits are great. 
Certain departments have flexible work from home policies. 
There are some areas of the business that are intellectually stimulating and run by intelligent, driven individuals. 
People outside of IMPG seem much happier with their roles/responsibilities.","Lack of appreciation for employees within the IMPG department, resulting in extremely high turnover, poor morale, and toxic work environment. 

During certain times of the year, you can be stuck working past midnight, doing work that easily could be automated/streamlined if management decided to spend the money on internal resources. 

The work is far from stimulating, and the processes in place are painstakingly inefficient. There are certain teams that do not finish their daily responsibilities until 8-9 pm on a regular basis, which puts a hindrance on work-life balance. 

Mid-level management is deficient. Several individuals have been placed in managerial positions solely because they are the only remaining team members as a result of rampant turnover.","When contemplating what has gone wrong, take a hard look in the mirror. People aren't the problem, the hiring process is not the problem... the problems are a broken operating model and poor internal culture. 

Be more appreciative of employees, treat them as human beings rather than just numbers. 

Ditch the arrogance... The business is far from invincible, and just because the firm is established in the space doesn't mean it is immune from external competition.  

Last, but not least, invest in technology. It is 2019 and as much as S&amp;P wants to consider itself a ""publishing firm"", it will need to adapt itself as a Fintech firm in order to survive. Other firms are able to provide similar services and products in a much more efficient manner, and there is only so long clients will put up with delays, mistakes, and expenses until they take their business elsewhere.",Disappointing Experience in IMPG,
