A look on the intranet would show you how skewed that is.  If people spend time reading the research and the empirical evidence around these topics rather than just jumping on the D&I bandwagon , it would be better for the company. Preferential hiring and expecting equality of outcomes , is a foolish endeavour. There is enough evidence out there to prove that.

After spinning off from McGraw Hill, ""S&amp;P Global"" cannot seem to get its footing and identity.

The corporate culture behaves like a small, ""start-up"" 100 person organization.  Everything is ""hodge-podge"" and there is no corporate foundation in terms of corporate structure including no corporate policies and standards (thus businesses and corporate have no direction or mandates and just do whatever they want), HR job positions and career bands are not setup and have 50 years of various, archaic, outdated HR positions so in HR system everyone has some crazy title that does not even come close the titles listed on their external or job posting, thus very hard to determine upward career path/promotions.  

The lack of legitimate corporate hierarchal Senior Leadership positions such as a formal ""CIO"" etc. who make global Technology decisions create more dysfunction and poor direction. 

Lastly, most of the management level ""Directors"" and higher have very little leadership and solid global experience.  As a result, very poor management causing toxic culture and very high turnover especially in Colorado offices.  This place is simply being ""used"" as a ""stepping stone"" for people who want a better title before the move on usually within a year or so.","Completely restructure your SVP, VP  roles so there are improved reporting functions and accountability.

-They have got a new Idea that to hire newer interns at cheaper salary than full time. They have started to threaten the existing employees to work as good as interns, or they have to leave the company.

-First they will make u act as mentors for new joiners, then once they got hold of the process and got all info that you have, they will become your immediate threat and which leads to even providing Expectation memos/termination or negligible bonuses.

-People performing marginally better will get 2 or 3 time the bonus you will get if the person is favored by the manager(i.e. an occasion of my team where older employees including me who was teaching the new employees got bonus as low as 6,500 to null for other employee as same experience as me), whereas the newer person who u taught everything and got same accuracy by fully asking you the procedures will be getting as high as 18,000 or even more.

- Older employees get lower pay then the new employees. Company hired new employees for 22,500 as new and 1 year back people were hired for 18,500. So not only they are getting more salary and bonuses also we- the older employees are expected to train them. (i dont get this - who is actually the senior here. The older person with lower wage or the new joinees who are getting much more).

If you are lucky enough to last six years and the grueling daily commute doesn't kill you, you will probably see so much upheaval, process change and outsourcing as to make your hiring company unrecognizable.

The company relies ever more on managerial self service for everything from hiring to firing and all matter of employee management decisions in between, yet the best they come up with for manager training in any new or revamped company process is a series of train yourself videos posted somewhere on the company's internal website.

MHFI became SPGI and traded its humanity and soul for a better stock price. Armies of people come and go. HR is dysfunctional and robotic.

It is so ""old school"" that it is a detriment to their success in retaining new talent. There is a ridiculous amount of paper waste because the culture is not digitized enough. This archaic, paper-wasting culture is perpetuated by old executives who are stuck in their old ways. There is also a tremendous amount of outsourcing in this company and each entity is terrible at communicating with eachother, so this leads to an unnecessary amount of extra leg work, which is placed on the shoulders of the support staff. There are also no real checks and balances in place to address bad managers. There are plenty in this company and their bad behavior is often rewarded with promotions. I had the misfortune of working for a very ""green"" executive, who was very insecure and afraid to question old habits and enforce a new way of doing business there.

The split has been difficult and created additional stress for employees who are already under significant stress levels. The split is not surprising in that the company is rooted in business that are stale and facing significant changes in the future (text books, advertising, financial ratings, etc.). The company has done a decent job of communicating as much as they can about the split but still, very stressful for most. 

On a day to day basis, each individual unit of the corporation is their own little company so it's hard to speak for what working at the corporation is like; I can only speak for my experience. In the Construction Group, where I work, new management is in place. Very ""rah rah"", but the reality on a day to day basis, it feels a bit like ""slave labor"" and you've never really done enough. Very high expectations, which is ok, but bordering on unreasonable at times. Instead of encouraging, senior management seems to thrive on ""humiliating"". Very few pats on the back and quite a few kicks in the butt. It's clear for most of the highest senior management in the group that work is their #1 life priority, but the reality is that for most of their employees, family is what comes first. I'll never forget hearing the CEO of the Construction Group in a town hall meeting saying ""I support the whole work/life concept, but...""; in other words, he doesn't support the work/life concept. If you're leaving at 5 pm it will definitely be noticed. You're expected to put in long hours.

I will say in the last year, all Construction employees received a nice bonus as the group achieved their financial objectives. I can't complain about this obviously but one thing that was odd was that this came as such a surprise. I would think that employees would have been encouraged as we reached the final quarter of the year that this bonus was a possibility as our goals were in reach, thereby motivating everyone to work harder. Instead, it came out of nowhere after the year was over and the communication about it just seemed lacking.","Just treat people with respect. We all want to succeed and we all are working hard. Many of us have gone from having full staffs to running entire departments by ourselves. Try and be encouraging. Encouragement doesn't come from yelling at people, talking down to people, humiliating people. Acknowledge what we are doing, if we aren't doing something you think we should then just try and understand why and what the issues are. Talk to us like adults, not children.",Reflecting back on 15 years with the company...,

Several examples of managers who either micromanage or don't pay enough attention to their employees.

There are many employees who are simply ""getting by,"" who don't actually pay enough attention to procedures or past mistakes and are doomed to make the same errors over and over again.  On top of that, their managers rarely do anything about it.  One of the biggest reasons is that HR is so entangled in every single decision that it's nearly impossible to get anyone fired from this place, even if they are doing a terrible job.

The performance management review process is antiquated and ridiculously complicated.

Deadlines are hard, fast and often cutthroat.  it seems like sales and marketing make most of the decisions without regards to anyone else's work/life balance.  I've worked about 60+ hours a week on a regular basis for months as a result.

A huge corporate reorganization was implemented in 2009 to shake up some of the broken procedures and dismantle departments/roles that an external consulting firm decided were no longer necessary.  Huge mistake.  We eliminated positions that were crucial to the publishing process (Umm... whose idea was it to remove proofreaders altogether?) and created new jobs that are still unclear to the masses.  Now we're spending more time trying to bend over backwards and fix things that weren't broken in the first place.

Opportunity for stock based compensation which can be rewarding but which has changed dramatically in recent years.","Company has become addicted to layoffs. Obviously these are difficult times for the publishing industry and S&P has had their well publicized problems, so it's naive to think that there won't be reductions in work force. However, there is little logic behind who is laid off. There are many ""do nothings"" at MH who have been there for 25+ years who would give anything to be let go and get a package so they can retire. Inevitably, those are the ones who are spared, and the people who actually do the work are often let go. Morale in the company is at rock bottom. Every year, in late November/early December, dozens of your peers will be let go. Happy Holidays! Again, I don't expect this not to happen, but it almost seems as if the company has become mean spirited about it. I know of one woman who was out for a year on disability due to a serious illness, cancer. She was let go within 6 months of coming back. And this was a lower level employee who did not make a lot of money. In other words, the company probably didn't even save anything by letting her go. Also, when you are told that you have to let one of your employees go (and no, they won't listen to your reasons why you need this person or why they are a valuable contributor to the group), you are specifically told you cannot say the words ""I am sorry"". Heartless. Again, morale is rock bottom as a result of these annual layoffs. But senior management doesn't understand something unless it is a number on a balance sheet.","Look beyond the numbers when you make decisions. Do a real employee survey to see what people think of the company and be honest with the results. Think long term. You make decisions which benefit the year, but you don't think of the longer term impact of these decisions. Think productivity has dropped since you started aggressively laying people off every year? Well it has.",It's all about the numbers.,

The prescription plan offers super cheap co-pays for generic drugs.  The company prides itself on being one of the top 10 companies for working women (according to Working Mother magazine), but this is a relatively new outlook.  Twenty years ago a working mother had little more than six-weeks maternity leave as a benefit.  Now there is family leave and resources for finding day care and sick-child care.  They also offer elder care help.  M-H has a liberal work/family policy including flex-time.  They offer tuition reimbursement and have a generous vacation and floating days policy.","There are few advancement opportunities with most major positions filled by outsiders who rarely stay with the company past their 2-3 year contract.  Meanwhile, people in the organization who have started at the bottom and worked their way up get stuck in middle management for years on end.  These are the people who know the company and know the customer and because they are valuable in their present position, they are left there to stagnate.  The people who do advance do so not because of their talents, but more likely because of their lack of vision-they don't rock the boat.  Most of the MH offices are in the field with some offices having less than 15 employees.  These offices and employees are the back-bone of this company but are the least appreciated and the least compensated.","Senior management needs to listen to the people on the front lines!  These employees deal with our customers on a daily basis; they know their names, their goals for their companies and their complaints about MH.  A lot of changes are made with little or no regard how these will affect the customer or, for that matter, the MH employee.   Too much emphasis is put on the bottom line.

I think the corporation realizes it needs to adapt to the changing ways of a younger generations, but is very slow to do this. The reason, is that a lot of the senior management is from the old school and less likely to adapt. If they don't start making better opportunities for the younger generation to move up in the work force, they will be left behind.","See above.
