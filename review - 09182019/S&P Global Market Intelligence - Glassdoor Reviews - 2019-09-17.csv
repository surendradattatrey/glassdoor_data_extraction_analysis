Lots of people worked off the clock to meet quotas even though they were told not to. 

Benefits are pretty good for industry standard, although pay lags. 

I've heard other parts of the company aren't bad if you're looking to coast.","They rate your articles, which is pretty much the entirety of your performance review. This is incredibly bizarre! It promotes mediocre or worse journalism because everyone is just trying to meet quotas and you can't have a real back and forth with your editor without worrying it's going in your rating. They tend to hire right out of school because the ""newsroom culture is so different and it's easier to train people in it than re-train more experienced journalists."" 

Translation: We don't produce news, we want you to write analyst reports for a cheaper salary than we can pay our analysts, and it's easier to get away with when we don't hire fully trained journalists. 

The newsroom is mostly run by people who worked at SNL (a company S&amp;P bought that did analysis type work). These people have never broken a story, written an investigative article or maintained a source relationship in their lives. It shows. It shows a lot. There was a joke of an ""investigative project"" which is essentially rehashing what other outlets have done and they continue to throw money at subpar work while pushing out people who are trying to create meaningful content. This has been going on for more than a year. Even at journalism conferences people are confused that S&amp;P has a newsroom. It's been literal years since it launched, but no one outside of an incredibly select few have ever produced something worthwhile, so it continues to go unknown while much newer newsrooms have steadily built readership. 

On some teams, it's not uncommon for articles to get 10 or so views. 

Mostly, your butt will sit at a desk and rewrite press releases for 8 hours a day. The rest of the time, you'll string together three analyst interviews to write a quick hot-take. That, apparently, qualifies as an ""exclusive.""","If you're not going to invest in news or create a real news product, don't pretend.",Yikes!,

SNL has turned this company into the lowest level of a work environment. Employee perks disappeared quickly. It's a bring your own office supplies environment, which I find unconscionable. I was in a hiring manager presentation that told us to ask whatever we want to identify the highest performers, but make sure to shred anything written so the Mike Chinn doesn't get sued.

I also witnessed and tried to stop male employees getting grossly larger raises and bonuses than more talented female colleagues. It's a bro atmosphere on every level. In fact, if you check the states, there are very few women in real positions of influence at the company. This was acknowledged and bandied about in multiple meetings.

S&amp;P is now SNL in disguise and has adopted their well-known persona of acting like a sweat shop. You can't imagine what a fall it's been from being a quality employer to one that forces out long-term employees to hire younger cheaper ones. Their claim of pay-for-performance is code for mandated bad reviews, unwarranted performance improvement plans, and an all-around demeaning of the people that work there.

It's quiet, and editors and reporters just sit at the computer like robots,  racing against time to meet the daily quota. 

Even though it claims to pursue ""journalism"", it suffers a severe identity crisis. It is trying to be both a Bloomberg/Reuters-type quick-paced newswire and an in-depth analytical publisher utilising proprietary data. Because of this lack of direction and focus, there is no system in place to train/guide the reporters  - the managers have no idea what kind of training is necessary. 

I've never been in a newsroom where the sole responsibility lies in the reporter, and the editor screams at you for a single spelling mistake and marks you down for non-substantial mistakes, even though they have also played a part in the product. A lot of energy is used on blaming and pointing fingers. The assessment system is designed based not on the quality and value of the content of the article, but on administrative factors such as whether the reporter remembered to attach source documents.

Worst of all, it does everything it can to ensure constant insecurity among the reporters.","Find focus,  quit encouraging a culture of insecurity and unhealthy competition, establish a proper training system,  place full responsibility on the editors -- they are not just keepers of the reporters but have some value-adding to do

Management is a revolving door that doesn't really make decisions that tip the scales all that much.

The biggest problem for US employees' future prospects is that the division has a ""hiring freeze"" that only seems to be in the US. This existed throughout my employment there, and didn't seem to extend to India, where we were rapidly staffing up. 

The majority of the division's tech staff is in India. On top of being a ""low cost location"" (salaries being about 1/5th of the US equivalent), an increasing amount of developers were being hired there. QA was entirely in India. It's very difficult to interface with people whose days hardly overlap with EST Americans and whose English skills vary widely.

At some point, before I left, we began to receive these emails from the head of the Market Intelligence (MI) platform extolling the virtues of crunch time (working weekends, removing all bugs, etc.), for the platform that was badly behind schedule. These emails went on for a full two months before, management ultimately decided to push back the release at least four months, but probably more.

When unrelated teams kept getting pulled in, MI showed off the fact that it was five year old tech that had been reskinned to sell to management, but with an increasing amount of ""low cost location"" labor behind it.

There were layoffs but mostly incompetent staff were affected. Decisions are being taken quickly which is great thing compared to earlier.

CTO is supportive to employees in aspects like training, good infrastructure, specifically got approvals quickly for pluralsight training,  systems upgrade & lower environment stability, good change from how it used to be. Puts good effort to communicate several aspects of technology space to employees.

COO is also very hard working and makes efforts to be transparent, this will help company survive and beat competition.

Other pros that exist before snl aquisition - work life balance, pay & good projects remain same as before.","Integration decisions are made one sided favouring SNL systems - such decisions have great support from top management - this is frustrating to CIQ employees as they feel there is no honest evaluation.

From the technology perspective, ciq employees feel things that we should build are bought from market and vice versa, but we need some more time to understand this better.

SNL teams market themself heavily - certain CIQ areas are criticised without understanding details thoroughly and ciq employees having hard time since people aren't listening, they can't go aggressive also as there is fear of elimination, same time SNL teams are very aggressive since they have backing so working environment for middle managers is not so great at the moment.

Quoting certain people like CTO by employees to get certain things done with in and outside priority is frustrating and influencing culture negatively.","Pay for performance is doing 10 times bad for 70% employees, than it's helping little to 30, slowly affecting we're one team atmosphere too. Please think about it at corporate level. Earlier performance appraisal of team + individual + company used to help everybody keep motivated.

TR and FDS are primed to leap ahead of the business not reliant on the CUSIP and Ratings monopolies.",Learn what talent retention means. Your best talent is leaving or wants to leave badly while the overpaid contributing next to nothing are protected by senior managers in an environment that resembles a Hollywood high school movie. Anyone can box subpar products and slap a guarantee on it. Just ask Tommy Boy. Some of you also have a thing or two to learn about professionalism.,No one is looking at the iceburg ahead,

With macro trends favoring SPGMI (migration away from expensive single license seats from Bloomberg/Eikon/FactSet, etc..., reduction in financial information spend since sell side is shrinking, difficulty generating alpha in buy side) this is clearly the financial information company to be part of for the next 3-5 years.

Yikes. Where to begin...
I was put on the mapping team that mainly consisted of legacy members. I applied for a ""Test Engineer II"" position and was offered a position as ""Test Engineer I"" with an on-boarding plan involving me moving up to the next level in a given timeline, which I reluctantly accepted.

After the first few months, I found myself trapped in a stagnant state of under-compelling work that left me feeling anything but motivated. I made several attempts to approach my manager during this time asking if there was anything I could do such as acquiring certifications or external work to ensure I could stay on track with the original plan. This was constantly swept under the rug and ignored. 

During the first round of performance reviews, I was falsely accused of not performing a full 40 hours of work during certain weeks of the year. The accusations were brought on by another tester on the mapping team that I suspect was threatened by my presence. I had no choice at this point to bring HR into the picture while meeting with my manager to clear my name. After enough long-winded meetings, my manager finally admitted on the record that these allegations had no proof or evidence, and that I was not fudging hours on my timesheet. Shortly after these incidents, I received a poor performance review. When approaching my manager about it, all he claimed was that it was as result of a ""Stack Ranking"" system which made him feel ""forced"" into giving me this inaccurate and poor rating.

Although I remained miserable for the next few following months, I gave one last attempt to bring up my concerns to my manager. I informed him that I felt more rewarded for silence than with engaging my ideas with my team. I told him how unhappy I was and how unfairly I thought I was being treated. His reaction to this was to tell me that it was probably the ""Right approach"" to stay quiet and under the radar and perhaps I would eventually feel better after enough time. Needless to say, I started applying for another job immediately following that meeting.

To shed some light on my qualifications and work ethic, I'm now employed at a much better place where I feel engaged, challenged, and rewarded for my work. I've gotten a tremendous amount of positive feedback from my team here, and received a raise after my first few months at the company. I'm not just some angry clock watching worker-bee trying to put in a bad rep of S&P Global for the sake of it. I was legitimately miserable, bored, and mistreated my entire time there.","As an educated female millennial, I felt that this was the most unwelcoming environment imaginable for young and passionate talent. I would have appreciated management giving me an unbiased and sincere attitude when approaching them about my concerns and unhappiness. It was clear my manager only cared about particular team members that had been around longer solely because he based an employees value on their collected knowledge of the team and product.

They lure you in with promises of advancement and high profile projects. There are lots of phony promises made . The reality is that you work on many projects that are ill-conceived and unprofitable. Its hard to market on your resume that you spent a year working on a project that was either scrapped because of the never-ending management changes or it was unprofitable because its not marketable.  The firm creates products without asking the customer if they would buy it.  Many research reports either have little viewership or creates no value for clients. Most of the MD's are out of their league, all talk  and just fake it by being loud and obnoxious.  It you show any initiative or offer alternative strategies, you risk being made redundant..  HR is also totally useless and has no backbone -  complaints have been made against some managers but HR does nothing to protect the employee.   Some managers may have personality disorders which  makes the daily workday difficult for employees but HR will not help.  If you want to succeed there, just suck up to management but don't do anything to stand out.  Just be political.  Promotions, bonuses and job stability depend on cronyism and favoritism.  Lastly, there is little investment going on now which means that the company will likely fall behind competitors - the key IT platform keeps crashing and hasn't been updated for years.","Get a clue!

No good development work is currently available. Most of their products are already moved to maintenance stage. They were simply using developers to support their products. That too 24x7. 

No one will care about your feedback or ask you whether you like your work or not. Even if you express yourself it won't get addressed properly.

No proper training. They are not interested in improving employees technical skills.

Policies are not followed equally thorough out the firm. They can be altered as your manager's wish.

Only 15 days of work from home is available for a year. Even a new mom with a toddler at home is also expected to work for 8 to 9 hours from office. They will question if you leave in 6 hours and log in from your home and work for 3-4 hours. They will even question if you are going to your home for lunch.

Colleagues are capable of peeking into your monitor anytime and ask questions on what you are doing. Its time for the firm to teach etiquettes to their employees.

Onsite team will expect you to be available even on a local holiday.

CIQ used to be a place of innovation and has now turned into a bureaucracy of cronyism. Each individual has his own personal agenda and strife is rampant. Total lack of communication as well, which has actually led to two different groups developing the same application without collaboration and neither side was aware of the other.

On a hot summer day, it's common to see employees in sandals and shorts. Capital IQ, from time to time, has these 'Townhall' meetings on Fridays (typically) where employees, management, owners of the company get together for beers. These 'townhall' meetings usually coincide with important milestones of the company such as a big software release or the end of a raving month for sales. Management is generally OK with people taking their vacation at any time as long as you let them know ahead of time (a month or so, the earlier the better).","Employees, save managers and senior employees, don't get the respect they deserve. You can and will get funny looks. Occasionally, one may even be made a laughing stock (literally). The lack of professionalism in this respect is rather shocking. Ongoing popularity contests are part and parcel of the work environment here. In order for employees to gain recognition, they *will* have to engage in small talk involving baseball and the like, as well as going out to bars with senior managers. As a result, employees who do not fit in culturally are ostracized, and often have to endure subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) hostility in a less-than-diverse work environment.
