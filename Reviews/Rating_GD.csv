In many cases people who were absolute top performers were affected. Most of these layoffs were handled very impersonally, in mass meetings of several to a dozen people all at once. In many cases the affected people's managers were never consulted or even informed until later. Although leadership will give reasons related to improving process and the like, everybody understands it is primarily for cost reasons, despite S&amp;P being an extraordinarily profitable company. The result is that the analytic staff is getting very junior, and the senior people are all very worried. This is a reputation-driven business, where customers want to feel that their analysts are experienced and know their business really well. S&amp;P leadership is betting that the franchise is strong enough the get away with gutting the ranks of senior analysts, managers, and risk management people without damaging their reputation or deal flow. The result is lower morale among experienced staff and more voluntary departures, as people no longer feel that strong performance provides stability to their career at S&amp;P.","Most of senior leadership has never rated a bond issue; they have never walked in analysts' shoes. They shouldn't be surprised if analysts feel they are out of touch. The President seems unaware that certain of his key senior leaders are reviled by the rank and file, hurting morale and the President's credibility. I recommend that the President reach down through a few layers of staff frequently, create a safe environment to listen one-on-one with trusted and experienced staff, to understand how people really feel about his leadership team and its actions.","Great company for entry level staff, but is laying off waves of senior people",

The essential nature of the ratings business has not changed much in decades (though there has been evolution to allow rating of new products). They have few competitors and the barrier to entry into the ratings business is high. Senior management appear to have limited fear of disruption by new players. Consequently, this is not a very dynamic company. It's slow to change, slow to adopt new ideas and technology, and the incentives for excellence are modest in comparison to highly competitive industries. This permeates all aspects of the business, and can be frustrating for motivated employees seeking to innovate and advance through merit 
o	Merit is recognized most of the time, but as with many large financial companies, politics play a disproportionate role in career advancement
o	Continuous turnover of senior IT management in recent years has made life difficult for all IT staff. Priorities and strategic direction are in constant flux
o	Emphasis on off-shoring and near-shoring has lengthened workday and made project execution more challenging for many NYC based IT staff
o	From an IT perspective, S&amp;P is generally playing catch-up when it comes to the latest tech: not the place to be if you want to be at the bleeding edge
o	Regulation and past blunders have created a ton of red tape around software development &amp; deployment, to the point where innovation and creativity often get compromised by laborious, unwieldy and ever expanding processes

You get to go home at the end of the day.,"I worked in the Colorado office, which for whatever reason became the destination for the editorial team, despite the main work being done in New York. This caused endless problems. Real access to management was almost non-existent. On-site management was virtually absent (constantly out to lunch, in conference meetings with NYC, taking copious days off, etc) and the NYC management would endlessly pass the buck; any attempt to ask questions or contact them was met with suggestions to ask another person, who invariably would also not be available. Training on the complex processes was extremely poor.  Communication between teams was beyond poor, and it was common for management to simply give the silent treatment to employees they weren't satisfied with, rather than addressing the issue as adults. Favoritism and petty politics abounded. Layoffs were common and led to tasks being delegated to editorial that should not have been. As a result, the job as I was ultimately asked to perform was not the job I applied for, interviewed for, or felt that I was signing up to do. When beginning a job at S&P, go in actively expecting that it has been falsely advertised to you. 

Technical problems were a constant. The software we used barely worked on the very best of days. All the IT and tech support was outsourced to India.

The programs would crash constantly and make it virtually impossible to meet deadlines.

1.  The business can be described as a ""factory"" that produces ratings.  As an employee, your job is to follow a set process to produce a rating, and then repeat the process over and over again.  There is little room for independent thought or creativity.  Anyone can do the job, so there is not much value for being smart or ambitious.  
2.  There's limited career advancement.  Expect to do the same thing over and over again until you find a new job.  No idea how promotions are made.  Some competent people sky rocket and other competent people float around in limbo. The organizational structure is also very top heavy, so not much room for younger employees to rise.  
3.  Upper level management is not competent.  We have high turnover (often to much smaller ratings agencies like Kroll, which has taken more than a few RMBS analysts) and declining market share.  Classic symptoms of poor management.  
4.  Management keeps creating new processes and organizational changes that make doing my job much harder.  Everything requires more approval and more forms to fill out.

It's first 'analyst class' began in summer of 2015 for class of 2015 graduates (undergrad). The classes are usually about 10-20 (at least in the New York office). 2) The analysts all start with a training program. This training gathers all analyst from all major S&P offices around the world and invites world-class NYU professors to teach finance, analysis, etc. 3) This program is an acceleration program in terms of corporate hierarchy. You can start as a research assistant, but it will take you AT LEAST a couple years to be at an analyst level. 4) Analysts in the US come from usually econ, finance backgrounds from east coast schools ranging from Rutgers to Yale. 5) The unique aspect of this program is supposed to expose you to ALL FOUR of the major money-maker departments. It is designed to start as a summer intern in ONE department, and rotate through THREE departments after graduation (assuming you get an offer back). 6) The exit opportunities are expected to be good. Obviously this is a new program so there's not a huge alumni network from the CREDit program. S&P kinda expects and hopes you to stay after the program and choose one of the rotation teams. I'm assuming many graduates can go on into the buy-side in the debt industry.","You will need to put in the time into this program. It's a competitive program and the upper management expect you to put in the time and effort. Yes, you won't be pulling investment banking hours, but don't expect it to be a 9-5 job, unless its the training period. You'll be rotating so don't expect to get comfortable too much since you'll be moving teams and changing bosses.","Interview according more to the analyst program itself. Obviously the candidates need to have a general finance background, but don't ask questions that aren't reflective of the analyst program. I don't know why the management team feels the need to ask investment banking questions and overly difficult questions. Also, be more responsive to the first and second analyst class - we will help you and HR refine the program so work with us. Take each of our feedback seriously.",CREDit Analyst Program,

Empower your employees and give them access to various learning tools (I think it's only the Bethesda office that lacks access).,"This office exemplifies ""Employee Dissatisfaction.""",

There is a good work life balance especially since middle managers and above are allowed to work from home at least twice a month. The senior managers are generally flexible with work hours and allow the employees to leave early as needed. There are also numerous career development opportunities including courses offered to improve industry knowledge. In addition, the various employee resource groups typically sponsor events on business topics and host mentoring programs for its members. The global presence of the company allows for employees to learn more about business operations in different offices across the world.","There are several downsides of working at S&P. Despite the emphasis on promoting employees from within the company, it is often not the case. Senior managers are usually hired from competitors which supposedly infuses the company with new and different ideas. However this is harmful for the employee morale when the new senior managers are absolutely clueless about the business operations of the company and blindly replicate the ideas that they used in their old company. If the idea was so powerful, why did they bother to leave their old company? Obviously there were problems with the idea to begin with. Secondly, the senior management have only looked at the financial statements when making decisions to lay-off their employees. Instead of focusing on cutting projects that are add no value, they decide to lay off groups that are instrumental to the daily operations of the company such as the mailroom and facilities group aka the same people that set up the laptop and projector for client meetings. They also tend to hire consultants who have no entrenched respect for the company - but I guess it doesn't matter as long as their salaries are lower than full-time employees.","The company has too many chiefs and not enough indians, to borrow a cliche. It is almost a joke for anyone with a title of Director or above because they do absolutely no work and create meaningless work for the people below them. It is difficult for senior management to cut the chiefs because they tend to be their ex-coworkers in previous companies. But ultimately, they must be eliminated from the company in order to allow for the hard-working employees to rise. Senior management needs to wake up and realize that the company is considered a joke by many investment firms. Spend more money on technology but please hire IT folks that actually know what they are doing and can speak English. It is difficult enough trying to call India for desktop support. But don't hire consultants who do the IT programming and business analyst work who speak in heavy accents...No one can understand them!!",More downsides than upside...,

S&P hires many MBA level and CFA associates so there are many intelligent people who are very friendly and down to earth.  As an undergraduate student, it was hard to adjust at first but the workers were very understanding and helpful in many different aspects.","Not a high profile job compared to others on Wall Street.  This isn't the type of job for people complacent with mediocrity and a 9-5 job.  The work is routinized and not too glamorous.  Promotions, I've heard, take very long to occur but the job security is present.  Consider this job if you want to work on Wall Street and place high importance on Work/Life balance.",Please provide more frequent feedback and less formality.,"Overall, decent people and decent pay, but not for the ambitious and/or cubicle-hating people.",

Compared to other Financial Institutions on the Street, S&P is the best place to work. It's moderate-pressure and they do not ask for a lot of time outside working hours. Of course, it's all manager-dependant. If you have a bad manager, your life can be hell. My manager is very flexible with schedule and work-from-home arrangments. Your experience will also depend on which group you're working for and how much money they're taking in. If your group is successful, management will leave you alone. If not, you could be on the chopping block.","Staff cuts in the last year, budget constraints",Be more forthright about the direction of the company,working at S&P,
