A lot of the middle managers seemed like the only reason they were where they were was because they stuck around. Promotions seemed to have a lot more to do with vacancies than new positions or expansion...Again seemed like there was some vast disconnects between executives and middle managers. Some middle managers did not seem to know/understand what their departments were actually capable of i.e. it seemed there was a a misunderstanding of what they numbers meant or what growth was possible. 

I don't know what an average turnover rate is for a company for SNL is but I want to say they told us it was around 15% when I was there. 

Basically if I was an applicant, I would ask lots and lots of specific questions when or before applying! I'm going to recommend the company in this review but my approval is very much contingent on the department, manager and expectations of the position.","Avoid implementing structural changes without first insuring your middle managers relay to you what is possible backed up by facts and numbers and considerations for the greater markets. As much as SNL is a data based company, make sure  you understand the data for your own company. Also not cool at all: changing compensation terms and expectations with little to no notice, and by changing, I mean cutting!",Know what you're getting yourself into! Ask lots of questions about the strategy and history of your department.,

What do they do here? Donkeywork. Hard monotonous repetitive work day in and day out.
 
Let's talk the ranking system then. 15 percent should be in the lower grade. that's what managers target. Now, if you're the one who's selected in the quarter, no matter how hard you work, they'll gang up with other people in the team to put you down. The others would also follow because they're donkeys in the first place. Then you'd be threatened and criticized twice in every hour by each one of them, that's 18 times every day at the minimum.
 
If you try to suggest change, you're a complete idiot trying to do that! They'll make you wait wait wait and wait more till you give up. Donkeys, utter donkeys!
 
There's a more meaningful this that working here - stay home!
 
Growth - that's a joke here, they'll put up a carrot in front of you and make you run till the time they want and when you've organically earned the hikes till the time you're too expensive. then they'll kick you out.","Start with chucking out your old performance system. 
 
The days of relative systems are gone. GE, Microsoft and other's are failing and reevaluating their ranking structures. It's high time you should too. Come up of something hybrid between absolute and relative. You've got a major portion of your employees who're Gen Y and have more impact on the social media than you can imagine. I'm going to tell this to everybody I know and more people will also know what happens in the offices. I'll possibly tell 200 people about what's going on and so forth the communication vine chain would follow.
 
Teach managers and all employees who don't know to resolve conflicts positively. I mean do it right now; otherwise they only thing you'd be doing in the future is putting out fires all the time. The structure would fall on it's own feet.

-World-class headquarters tower in vibrant downtown Charlottesville Va., one of the best all-around cities in the U.S.
-Collaboration across silos has helped SNL distinguish itself as a best-in-class financial news and data source.
-Following a private-equity backed buyout and recapitalization in 2011, SNL has been in a rapid growth mode, both organically and through acquisitions, leading to considerable opportunity for upward mobility.","-Traditionally pays salaries on the low end of the competitive scale, an issue that has been exacerbated with the effective elimination  (for the vast majority of staff and management) of employee stock grants as a component of compensation following the 2011 change-in-control of the company. 
-The resulting high turnover, particularly of the best and brightest employees, stems from the compensation problem and, further, contributes to the strain already felt among many core groups of producers who run lean operations in the first place and can rarely afford the frequent defection of key team members.","While understandably constrained by financial arrangements aimed at maximizing the enterprise value for the majority owner/investor, New Mountain Capital, I would like to see a loosening of restrictions on granting restricted stock to a wider pool of top-performing employees as a retention tool and to instill a greater sense of vested interest and financial incentive to perform at the highest level. Additionally, the virtual elimination of the 401(k) matching contribution during the global financial crisis and ahead of the company's sale, leaves a bad taste in anyone's mouth who were brought aboard under the impression that there was a traditional matching contribution plan (up to 6% of income) for retirement funding. It's sudden and unfortunate demise only adds fuel to speculation that while he company is adding headcount (largely off-shore) and expanding its offerings, the moves are motivated with an eye toward short-term revenues and margins.

But last year they moved to the infamous system started by GE's Jack Welsh, with each employee rated either a 1,2,3,or 4, with the 1s getting no bonuses and pushed out the door and 4s getting the best bonus. The problem is each rating  period the ratings have to fit a mandated percentage, with 15-20% having to be rated 1s regardless of performance, only 10% 4s, and the rest in between. 

The result is that managers are forced to make up excuses for rating someone  lower than their actual performance, which is not only unethical, but also has resulted in a lot of very good employees either being pushed out the door or leaving on their own because they are so fed up with the whole  process. Employee morale has also plummeted because workers are no longer compensated based on performance but rather on the need to meet mandate quotas, with managers caught in the middle and very frustrated

Upper management doesn't care because they don't see their employees as valuable assets but rather as cogs in a machine that can be replaced at any time, which is not the case for many of the employees because they  do tasks that require a lot of industry specific knowledge and experience. As for those who do other things, their jobs are being shipped to Pakistan and India anyway.

Other HR policies have also becoming increasingly bad over the past few years, from employees not being allowed to carry over ANY unused leave the end of the year to the company basically eliminating any 401K matching contributions. 

Thus, for whatever reason top management has turned very hostile to their employees, and the result is I've never worked in a place where the employees dislike the company they work for so much, even though they might  like their specific jobs. Thus, many are leaving, and those who stay only do so because they cannot find work elsewhere. As soon as the economy turns around, however, they also will be able to find jobs and SNL will realize how much talent they've lost that is very difficult to replace.","Get rid of the Jack Welch philosophy and return to paying your workers based on their true performances, eliminate most of the crushing number of procedures that must be followed and the many managers in charge of developing and implementing them, and recognize your employees as valuable assets rather than readily replaceable cogs in a machine.",Not a good place to work,
