CIQ used to be a place of innovation and has now turned into a bureaucracy of cronyism. Each individual has his own personal agenda and strife is rampant. Total lack of communication as well, which has actually led to two different groups developing the same application without collaboration and neither side was aware of the other.

There's no turning back at this point - they just let way too many smart people leave at the wrong times.

Previous turnover had been almost none in many years.  Capital IQ used to be a coherent, complete organization and has been broken apart and included in a larger part of Standard and Poors.  The passion for the business has gone and, whilst the new leadership at the Capital IQ level may have its heart in the right place, the same cannot be said for the next level up.","Although some changes to align with overall direction are understandable, do not lose what made Capital IQ able to compete and grow so successfully for a long time against much larger players.","Passion, potential and longterm opportunity gone; standard S&P mentality arrived with departure of old managment."

On a hot summer day, it's common to see employees in sandals and shorts.

These 'townhall' meetings usually coincide with important milestones of the company such as a big software release or the end of a raving month for sales.

You can and will get funny looks. Occasionally, one may even be made a laughing stock (literally). The lack of professionalism in this respect is rather shocking. Ongoing popularity contests are part and parcel of the work environment here. In order for employees to gain recognition, they *will* have to engage in small talk involving baseball and the like, as well as going out to bars with senior managers.

Senior employees and management are very self-centered in their approach to problems and ways of doing things. They are generally unaware of this. Alternative ideas or suggestions are often shot down almost purely due to this factor.  Management has poor (over-aggressive) estimates for project management. Quality-assurance teams are completely out-sourced. Communication barriers and time zone differences can lead to frustrating and inefficient debugging cycles.
