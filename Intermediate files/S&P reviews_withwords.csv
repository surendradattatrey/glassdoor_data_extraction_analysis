Because of several acquisitions that happened in the past, the company became bigger and better. It operates globally and has offices in Makati and Pasig. Since the company is growing so fast, there are also a lot of opportunities here. The company supports work-life balance and offers 15 days of paid vacation leaves per year. In terms of salary, the company offers a competitive salary package, higher that what other companies in the Philippines offer. The salary increases every year. There is education reimbursement if you want to pursue Masters Degree or even Doctor's Degree. The healthcare benefits includes two dependents (can be your parents or siblings or children) and there is also life insurance for free as long as you are still an employee of the company. Salary increase is yearly. Workload is okay, not too much for you to handle. Many employees are very young and dynamic. No overtime unless something very very urgent needs to be done which rarely happens. This company is a good institution because it cares about its people.

2143,"The company matches the pay of oil broking companies to discourage their reporters from moving out into the industry. And it works as most of my ex-colleagues who are smart enough to qualify working in a trading house were dissuaded by the pay cut from jumping onto a trade support role. Loads of opportunity to network and travel or to speak in conferences. You also learn a lot from the sources in the industry and also from the Managing Editors/seniors who can be knowledgeable. This is the case in Singapore at least. I think the most valuable for me is learning about the energy pricing, trade flows, economics, and other factors that energy traders care about the most. A major pro is that, by conducting analysis, primary research and due diligence, reporters generate relevant content and it's not something insubstantial - there's a reason why analysts and brokers copy these articles in their internal reports after all. Information gathering is a relevant skill and is one thing that the industry sadly overlooks when they see a Platts reporter. The managers are encouraging and nurturing, and will ensure that you get the proper training before you represent the company in the industry. The job is not for the faint-hearted and is thus a good character-building experience - you can encounter objections (sometimes nasty confrontations) on your price assessments.","The company matches the pay of oil broking companies to discourage their reporters from moving out into the industry.
