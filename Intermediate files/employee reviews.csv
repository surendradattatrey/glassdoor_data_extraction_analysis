Management is a revolving door that doesn't really make decisions that tip the scales all that much.

The biggest problem for US employees' future prospects is that the division has a ""hiring freeze"" that only seems to be in the US. This existed throughout my employment there, and didn't seem to extend to India, where we were rapidly staffing up. 

The majority of the division's tech staff is in India. On top of being a ""low cost location"" (salaries being about 1/5th of the US equivalent), an increasing amount of developers were being hired there. QA was entirely in India. It's very difficult to interface with people whose days hardly overlap with EST Americans and whose English skills vary widely.

At some point, before I left, we began to receive these emails from the head of the Market Intelligence (MI) platform extolling the virtues of crunch time (working weekends, removing all bugs, etc.), for the platform that was badly behind schedule. These emails went on for a full two months before, management ultimately decided to push back the release at least four months, but probably more.

When unrelated teams kept getting pulled in, MI showed off the fact that it was five year old tech that had been reskinned to sell to management, but with an increasing amount of ""low cost location"" labor behind it.

There were layoffs but mostly incompetent staff were affected. Decisions are being taken quickly which is great thing compared to earlier.

CTO is supportive to employees in aspects like training, good infrastructure, specifically got approvals quickly for pluralsight training,  systems upgrade & lower environment stability, good change from how it used to be. Puts good effort to communicate several aspects of technology space to employees.

COO is also very hard working and makes efforts to be transparent, this will help company survive and beat competition.

Other pros that exist before snl aquisition - work life balance, pay & good projects remain same as before.","Integration decisions are made one sided favouring SNL systems - such decisions have great support from top management - this is frustrating to CIQ employees as they feel there is no honest evaluation.

From the technology perspective, ciq employees feel things that we should build are bought from market and vice versa, but we need some more time to understand this better.

SNL teams market themself heavily - certain CIQ areas are criticised without understanding details thoroughly and ciq employees having hard time since people aren't listening, they can't go aggressive also as there is fear of elimination, same time SNL teams are very aggressive since they have backing so working environment for middle managers is not so great at the moment.

Quoting certain people like CTO by employees to get certain things done with in and outside priority is frustrating and influencing culture negatively.","Pay for performance is doing 10 times bad for 70% employees, than it's helping little to 30, slowly affecting we're one team atmosphere too. Please think about it at corporate level. Earlier performance appraisal of team + individual + company used to help everybody keep motivated. Not all teams would have challenges all cycles , that also used to balance spikes easily.

Please try to address CIQ teams integration concerns on biased decisions, put honest efforts.","Changing for good, some frustrations interim",

It's currently undergoing a large integration project, details of which are publicly disclosed in S&P Global's SEC filings. Having said that, what I will say is once the integration is complete this firm is going to launch a series of products the market has never seen before. With macro trends favoring SPGMI (migration away from expensive single license seats from Bloomberg/Eikon/FactSet, etc..., reduction in financial information spend since sell side is shrinking, difficulty generating alpha in buy side) this is clearly the financial information company to be part of for the next 3-5 years. 

The management team is almost entirely from SNL Financial, who built an incredibly profitable, resilient business by aggregating publicly available data better and faster than much larger competitors. I am incredibly impressed by their drive, open communication and commitment to accountability. Competitors should be very concerned.....","My only concern would be the sheer amount of change the firm is undergoing to get the entire division aligned to common goals and a singular purpose.

Yikes. Where to begin...
I was put on the mapping team that mainly consisted of legacy members. I applied for a ""Test Engineer II"" position and was offered a position as ""Test Engineer I"" with an on-boarding plan involving me moving up to the next level in a given timeline, which I reluctantly accepted.

After the first few months, I found myself trapped in a stagnant state of under-compelling work that left me feeling anything but motivated. I made several attempts to approach my manager during this time asking if there was anything I could do such as acquiring certifications or external work to ensure I could stay on track with the original plan. This was constantly swept under the rug and ignored. 

During the first round of performance reviews, I was falsely accused of not performing a full 40 hours of work during certain weeks of the year. The accusations were brought on by another tester on the mapping team that I suspect was threatened by my presence. I had no choice at this point to bring HR into the picture while meeting with my manager to clear my name. After enough long-winded meetings, my manager finally admitted on the record that these allegations had no proof or evidence, and that I was not fudging hours on my timesheet. Shortly after these incidents, I received a poor performance review. When approaching my manager about it, all he claimed was that it was as result of a ""Stack Ranking"" system which made him feel ""forced"" into giving me this inaccurate and poor rating.

Although I remained miserable for the next few following months, I gave one last attempt to bring up my concerns to my manager. I informed him that I felt more rewarded for silence than with engaging my ideas with my team. I told him how unhappy I was and how unfairly I thought I was being treated. His reaction to this was to tell me that it was probably the ""Right approach"" to stay quiet and under the radar and perhaps I would eventually feel better after enough time. Needless to say, I started applying for another job immediately following that meeting.

To shed some light on my qualifications and work ethic, I'm now employed at a much better place where I feel engaged, challenged, and rewarded for my work. I've gotten a tremendous amount of positive feedback from my team here, and received a raise after my first few months at the company. I'm not just some angry clock watching worker-bee trying to put in a bad rep of S&P Global for the sake of it. I was legitimately miserable, bored, and mistreated my entire time there.","As an educated female millennial, I felt that this was the most unwelcoming environment imaginable for young and passionate talent. I would have appreciated management giving me an unbiased and sincere attitude when approaching them about my concerns and unhappiness. It was clear my manager only cared about particular team members that had been around longer solely because he based an employees value on their collected knowledge of the team and product.

Also-- good luck with the next sucker you throw on the mapping team.",Bureaucratic Hell,

On a hot summer day, it's common to see employees in sandals and shorts. Capital IQ, from time to time, has these 'Townhall' meetings on Fridays (typically) where employees, management, owners of the company get together for beers. These 'townhall' meetings usually coincide with important milestones of the company such as a big software release or the end of a raving month for sales. Management is generally OK with people taking their vacation at any time as long as you let them know ahead of time (a month or so, the earlier the better).","Employees, save managers and senior employees, don't get the respect they deserve. You can and will get funny looks. Occasionally, one may even be made a laughing stock (literally). The lack of professionalism in this respect is rather shocking. Ongoing popularity contests are part and parcel of the work environment here. In order for employees to gain recognition, they *will* have to engage in small talk involving baseball and the like, as well as going out to bars with senior managers. As a result, employees who do not fit in culturally are ostracized, and often have to endure subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) hostility in a less-than-diverse work environment.

Senior employees and management are very self-centered in their approach to problems and ways of doing things. They are generally unaware of this. Alternative ideas or suggestions are often shot down almost purely due to this factor.  Management has poor (over-aggressive) estimates for project management. Quality-assurance teams are completely out-sourced. Communication barriers and time zone differences can lead to frustrating and inefficient debugging cycles.

In many cases people who were absolute top performers were affected. Most of these layoffs were handled very impersonally, in mass meetings of several to a dozen people all at once. In many cases the affected people's managers were never consulted or even informed until later. Although leadership will give reasons related to improving process and the like, everybody understands it is primarily for cost reasons, despite S&amp;P being an extraordinarily profitable company. The result is that the analytic staff is getting very junior, and the senior people are all very worried. This is a reputation-driven business, where customers want to feel that their analysts are experienced and know their business really well. S&amp;P leadership is betting that the franchise is strong enough the get away with gutting the ranks of senior analysts, managers, and risk management people without damaging their reputation or deal flow. The result is lower morale among experienced staff and more voluntary departures, as people no longer feel that strong performance provides stability to their career at S&amp;P.","Most of senior leadership has never rated a bond issue; they have never walked in analysts' shoes. They shouldn't be surprised if analysts feel they are out of touch. The President seems unaware that certain of his key senior leaders are reviled by the rank and file, hurting morale and the President's credibility. I recommend that the President reach down through a few layers of staff frequently, create a safe environment to listen one-on-one with trusted and experienced staff, to understand how people really feel about his leadership team and its actions.","Great company for entry level staff, but is laying off waves of senior people",NA

The essential nature of the ratings business has not changed much in decades (though there has been evolution to allow rating of new products). They have few competitors and the barrier to entry into the ratings business is high. Senior management appear to have limited fear of disruption by new players. Consequently, this is not a very dynamic company. It's slow to change, slow to adopt new ideas and technology, and the incentives for excellence are modest in comparison to highly competitive industries. This permeates all aspects of the business, and can be frustrating for motivated employees seeking to innovate and advance through merit 
o	Merit is recognized most of the time, but as with many large financial companies, politics play a disproportionate role in career advancement
o	Continuous turnover of senior IT management in recent years has made life difficult for all IT staff. Priorities and strategic direction are in constant flux
o	Emphasis on off-shoring and near-shoring has lengthened workday and made project execution more challenging for many NYC based IT staff

o	S&amp;P IT leaders have tried to implement Agile repeatedly, and if questioned would say that Agile is the methodology used for development.

Good work-life balance.  Generally a 9:30 to 5:30 job.  Easy to work remotely.  
2.  Compensation is good given the low stress.  Good benefits too (6% matching)

4.  Good exposure to the capital markets; possible to leave to higher paying but more stressful jobs.
5.  Less likely to fire staff in downturns.","(I worked in Structured Finance) 

1.  The business can be described as a ""factory"" that produces ratings.  As an employee, your job is to follow a set process to produce a rating, and then repeat the process over and over again.  There is little room for independent thought or creativity.  Anyone can do the job, so there is not much value for being smart or ambitious.  
2.  There's limited career advancement.  Expect to do the same thing over and over again until you find a new job.  No idea how promotions are made.  Some competent people sky rocket and other competent people float around in limbo. The organizational structure is also very top heavy, so not much room for younger employees to rise.  
3.  Upper level management is not competent.  We have high turnover (often to much smaller ratings agencies like Kroll, which has taken more than a few RMBS analysts) and declining market share.  Classic symptoms of poor management.  
4.  Management keeps creating new processes and organizational changes that make doing my job much harder.  Everything requires more approval and more forms to fill out.  It seems the problem is that there are too many managers, so many of them are creating solutions to imaginary problems.","Give employees a path to grow, or they will find growth elsewhere.

It's first 'analyst class' began in summer of 2015 for class of 2015 graduates (undergrad). The classes are usually about 10-20 (at least in the New York office). 2) The analysts all start with a training program. This training gathers all analyst from all major S&P offices around the world and invites world-class NYU professors to teach finance, analysis, etc. 3) This program is an acceleration program in terms of corporate hierarchy. You can start as a research assistant, but it will take you AT LEAST a couple years to be at an analyst level. 4) Analysts in the US come from usually econ, finance backgrounds from east coast schools ranging from Rutgers to Yale. 5) The unique aspect of this program is supposed to expose you to ALL FOUR of the major money-maker departments. It is designed to start as a summer intern in ONE department, and rotate through THREE departments after graduation (assuming you get an offer back). 6) The exit opportunities are expected to be good. Obviously this is a new program so there's not a huge alumni network from the CREDit program. S&P kinda expects and hopes you to stay after the program and choose one of the rotation teams. I'm assuming many graduates can go on into the buy-side in the debt industry.","You will need to put in the time into this program. It's a competitive program and the upper management expect you to put in the time and effort. Yes, you won't be pulling investment banking hours, but don't expect it to be a 9-5 job, unless its the training period. You'll be rotating so don't expect to get comfortable too much since you'll be moving teams and changing bosses.","Interview according more to the analyst program itself. Obviously the candidates need to have a general finance background, but don't ask questions that aren't reflective of the analyst program. I don't know why the management team feels the need to ask investment banking questions and overly difficult questions.

Despite the emphasis on promoting employees from within the company, it is often not the case. Senior managers are usually hired from competitors which supposedly infuses the company with new and different ideas. However this is harmful for the employee morale when the new senior managers are absolutely clueless about the business operations of the company and blindly replicate the ideas that they used in their old company. If the idea was so powerful, why did they bother to leave their old company? Obviously there were problems with the idea to begin with. Secondly, the senior management have only looked at the financial statements when making decisions to lay-off their employees. Instead of focusing on cutting projects that are add no value, they decide to lay off groups that are instrumental to the daily operations of the company such as the mailroom and facilities group aka the same people that set up the laptop and projector for client meetings. They also tend to hire consultants who have no entrenched respect for the company - but I guess it doesn't matter as long as their salaries are lower than full-time employees.","The company has too many chiefs and not enough indians, to borrow a cliche. It is almost a joke for anyone with a title of Director or above because they do absolutely no work and create meaningless work for the people below them. It is difficult for senior management to cut the chiefs because they tend to be their ex-coworkers in previous companies. But ultimately, they must be eliminated from the company in order to allow for the hard-working employees to rise. Senior management needs to wake up and realize that the company is considered a joke by many investment firms. Spend more money on technology but please hire IT folks that actually know what they are doing and can speak English. It is difficult enough trying to call India for desktop support.

After spinning off from McGraw Hill, ""S&amp;P Global"" cannot seem to get its footing and identity.

The corporate culture behaves like a small, ""start-up"" 100 person organization.  Everything is ""hodge-podge"" and there is no corporate foundation in terms of corporate structure including no corporate policies and standards (thus businesses and corporate have no direction or mandates and just do whatever they want), HR job positions and career bands are not setup and have 50 years of various, archaic, outdated HR positions so in HR system everyone has some crazy title that does not even come close the titles listed on their external or job posting, thus very hard to determine upward career path/promotions.  

The lack of legitimate corporate hierarchal Senior Leadership positions such as a formal ""CIO"" etc. who make global Technology decisions create more dysfunction and poor direction. 

Lastly, most of the management level ""Directors"" and higher have very little leadership and solid global experience.  As a result, very poor management causing toxic culture and very high turnover especially in Colorado offices.  This place is simply being ""used"" as a ""stepping stone"" for people who want a better title before the move on usually within a year or so.","Completely restructure your SVP, VP  roles so there are improved reporting functions and accountability. More importantly, mandate formal processes to be developed and implemented PRIOR to trying to automate and implement technologies.  Bringing in tools as a quick fix to try to mature wont work as your internal departments and functions have no idea what each other are doing and they cannot even explain if you ask them. This spells continual rework and people moving on to greener pastures.  Good luck.",Very Immature and Poor Organizational Structure. Disparate Siloed Functions,"Thank you for your feedback.

Several examples of managers who either micromanage or don't pay enough attention to their employees.

There are many employees who are simply ""getting by,"" who don't actually pay enough attention to procedures or past mistakes and are doomed to make the same errors over and over again.  On top of that, their managers rarely do anything about it.  One of the biggest reasons is that HR is so entangled in every single decision that it's nearly impossible to get anyone fired from this place, even if they are doing a terrible job.

The performance management review process is antiquated and ridiculously complicated.

Deadlines are hard, fast and often cutthroat.  it seems like sales and marketing make most of the decisions without regards to anyone else's work/life balance.  I've worked about 60+ hours a week on a regular basis for months as a result.

A huge corporate reorganization was implemented in 2009 to shake up some of the broken procedures and dismantle departments/roles that an external consulting firm decided were no longer necessary.

We eliminated positions that were crucial to the publishing process (Umm... whose idea was it to remove proofreaders altogether?) and created new jobs that are still unclear to the masses.

It produces and scores standardized K-12 tests under contract with state education departments, and it is suffering the fallout from education-department budget cutbacks and from aggressive industry competition that didn't exist several years ago.

When rounds of layoffs take place, those with the most experience and knowledge are typically at the top of the heave-ho list.  Moreover, the company has long mastered the art of exploiting temporary workers; it receives what amounts to full-time labor, over the course of many years in lots of cases, from tons of people to whom it doesn't need to offer paid vacation time, health-care insurance, or other benefits.  A sizable percentage of the company's de facto full-time workforce consists of ""temps.”  In fact, the standardized tests produced by the company, once they have been administered to students and returned to CTB/McGraw-Hill, are scored by temporary employees only!

Every 6 months we see a reorganization happen and these reorgs don't happen because of the on-boarding of a new market, but to make the powers that be have a chance of hiding the fact that most of the management (senior) are ineffective.

They made more than a billion dollars in profit in 2007, and like a shark smelling blood, are focused on improving that figure. This will be done at the cost of the employees.","If you are unlucky enough to be placed under an unfair or biased manager, you make be stuck there for many many years with no way to get out. Internal managers always ask current managers for their experience with an employee before consideration for promotion. If your current manager doesn't like you, he WILL make sure you are unable to leave his department.  Since HR has been outsourced for the most part you have no source of help.","Take some of the management courses you continue to force on others. Since most of MH senior management is hired externally, they have no previous knowledge or experience about MH policy, yet they are given any training in this respect. 
Also stop trying to make a name for yourself at the cost of your staff. Most likely you are new to MH, but your staff has had to prove themselves for years to every other 'new' sr. manager!","Watch your back, MH management will do anything to justify and keep their jobs, even if it means lying.",

Opportunity for stock based compensation which can be rewarding but which has changed dramatically in recent years.","Company has become addicted to layoffs. Obviously these are difficult times for the publishing industry and S&P has had their well publicized problems, so it's naive to think that there won't be reductions in work force. However, there is little logic behind who is laid off. There are many ""do nothings"" at MH who have been there for 25+ years who would give anything to be let go and get a package so they can retire. Inevitably, those are the ones who are spared, and the people who actually do the work are often let go. Morale in the company is at rock bottom. Every year, in late November/early December, dozens of your peers will be let go. Happy Holidays! Again, I don't expect this not to happen, but it almost seems as if the company has become mean spirited about it. I know of one woman who was out for a year on disability due to a serious illness, cancer. She was let go within 6 months of coming back. And this was a lower level employee who did not make a lot of money. In other words, the company probably didn't even save anything by letting her go. Also, when you are told that you have to let one of your employees go (and no, they won't listen to your reasons why you need this person or why they are a valuable contributor to the group), you are specifically told you cannot say the words ""I am sorry"". Heartless. Again, morale is rock bottom as a result of these annual layoffs. But senior management doesn't understand something unless it is a number on a balance sheet.","Look beyond the numbers when you make decisions. Do a real employee survey to see what people think of the company and be honest with the results. Think long term. You make decisions which benefit the year, but you don't think of the longer term impact of these decisions. Think productivity has dropped since you started aggressively laying people off every year? Well it has.",It's all about the numbers.,

The pay in New York, at least, appears to be somewhat competitive with a fair sick and time off policy.","The corporate structure of the corporation is still stuck in a 1950s mentality and there still is a large portion of employees at all levels have worked the company for 20 or more years--this harks back to the one workplace in your career. I think the corporation realizes it needs to adapt to the changing ways of a younger generations, but is very slow to do this. The reason, is that a lot of the senior management is from the old school and less likely to adapt. If they don't start making better opportunities for the younger generation to move up in the work force, they will be left behind.","See above. As much as the senior management like to portray an image of adaptability to its stock holders and clients, it's not all that.

IT since depends on technology hence here it might have some exposure to changes and learnings from outside world but the company is into data collection and maintenance for its own data platform, hence on data collection side everything being done in this company is somewhat ""exclusive"" to it only.
The company has suffered a lot due to frequent Global Top level Leadership changes so guidance of any sort is missing right from the top.
The site top and middle level management suffer from inverse of what happened to the top leadership. There is no change at all. Also the entire Top management here at India site is filled with people who are ingrown so they lack any kind of outside exposure at all. They do not have idea about any global best practices in data collection procedures. To be precise, most of the ""leaders"" are pretty laid back (as if at their fag-end of career!!. They joined the company and saw their career grew at blitzkrieg speed at very fortunate times!! The same like muck rises during high-tide..)
Almost all of the new hires are freshers out of college. Mostly what is looked into at time of hiring is 
1. Good command on english
2. Decent aptitude
3. Stability (not being too ambitious to be very frank)
I saw some good smart freshers joining till few years back. But now due to cost cutting, the company has now started hiring from tier 3 and tier 4 city colleges. Seems like they want ""cheap and best"".

A good place for elderly people and Hyderabadis to work on a routine basis.","In Hyderabad office they supports only Telugu people the most. They can be renamed as TNC (Telugu national company) instead of MNC. Everyone will talk in Telugu in meetings and no one cares whether you understood or not. Even senior officials will use to discuss about you that too in front of you in Telugu.

No good development work is currently available. Most of their products are already moved to maintenance stage. They were simply using developers to support their products. That too 24x7. 

No one will care about your feedback or ask you whether you like your work or not. Even if you express yourself it won't get addressed properly. 

Lot of micromanagement which you initially won't realize. 

No proper training. They are not interested in improving employees technical skills.

Policies are not followed equally thorough out the firm. They can be altered as your manager's wish.

Only 15 days of work from home is available for a year. Even a new mom with a toddler at home is also expected to work for 8 to 9 hours from office. They will question if you leave in 6 hours and log in from your home and work for 3-4 hours. They will even question if you are going to your home for lunch.

Colleagues are capable of peeking into your monitor anytime and ask questions on what you are doing. Its time for the firm to teach etiquettes to their employees.

Onsite team will expect you to be available even on a local holiday.

No friendly working environment. 

Assessment and ratings are not transparent. Lots of politics.

There is no proper hierarchy.

Canteen and food they provide sucks.",Seriously it is time for you to work on.,Poor management of talents and resources,

The experience from this place is pretty much useless, it is close to impossible to move to another company, unless you have some additional certifications (such as CA, CFA, etc).

There is a certain amount of preference for male employees, when it comes to special projects.

c) Massive exodus of talent. Most of the technology team has quit as mentioned by other reviewers. Same trend beginning to appear in research/analytics.

d) Lack of transparency and honesty (a marked change from the pre-2009 times).
