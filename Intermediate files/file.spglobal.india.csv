IT since depends on technology hence here it might have some exposure to changes and learnings from outside world but the company is into data collection and maintenance for its own data platform, hence on data collection side everything being done in this company is somewhat ""exclusive"" to it only.
The company has suffered a lot due to frequent Global Top level Leadership changes so guidance of any sort is missing right from the top.
The site top and middle level management suffer from inverse of what happened to the top leadership. There is no change at all. Also the entire Top management here at India site is filled with people who are ingrown so they lack any kind of outside exposure at all. They do not have idea about any global best practices in data collection procedures. To be precise, most of the ""leaders"" are pretty laid back (as if at their fag-end of career!!. They joined the company and saw their career grew at blitzkrieg speed at very fortunate times!! The same like muck rises during high-tide..)
Almost all of the new hires are freshers out of college. Mostly what is looked into at time of hiring is 
1. Good command on english
2. Decent aptitude
3. Stability (not being too ambitious to be very frank)
I saw some good smart freshers joining till few years back. But now due to cost cutting, the company has now started hiring from tier 3 and tier 4 city colleges. Seems like they want ""cheap and best"".
So it can really become a muck of sorts after sometime for people really want their career to grow and be market ready."," ","Good ""Job Pay"" but bad ""Career Returns"""," "

Also managers and management running under the impression basis growth providing opportunity, at the time of joining if you get marked as less skilled then how much you improve and learn new things for your next desired role still you're evaluate as low rating.

3) They have flexible timings. What they really care is if you are completing your goals on time or not.

A good place for elderly people and Hyderabadis to work on a routine basis.","In Hyderabad office they supports only Telugu people the most. They can be renamed as TNC (Telugu national company) instead of MNC. Everyone will talk in Telugu in meetings and no one cares whether you understood or not. Even senior officials will use to discuss about you that too in front of you in Telugu.

No good development work is currently available. Most of their products are already moved to maintenance stage. They were simply using developers to support their products. That too 24x7. 

No one will care about your feedback or ask you whether you like your work or not. Even if you express yourself it won't get addressed properly. 

Lot of micromanagement which you initially won't realize. 

No proper training. They are not interested in improving employees technical skills.

Policies are not followed equally thorough out the firm. They can be altered as your manager's wish.

Only 15 days of work from home is available for a year. Even a new mom with a toddler at home is also expected to work for 8 to 9 hours from office. They will question if you leave in 6 hours and log in from your home and work for 3-4 hours. They will even question if you are going to your home for lunch.

Colleagues are capable of peeking into your monitor anytime and ask questions on what you are doing. Its time for the firm to teach etiquettes to their employees.

Onsite team will expect you to be available even on a local holiday.

No friendly working environment. 

Assessment and ratings are not transparent. Lots of politics.

3) Too much politics - Promotions are not on the basis of MERIT.. there is no transparency ..a person with 4 years in job will be a level 2 while a fresher with 2 years in company might be senior just because of stupid policies...

4) work is also not challenging... work become mundane after some time, its like a call center where u spend half of the time in replying to client issues 

5) No ONSITE opportunity - US will be a dream for u, only top management goes abroad and for others Webex and video conferencing :P","Management is controlled by a bunch of guys and they do whatever they like, too much favoritism by the Managers, if you have good terms with manager then its ok else there is no one to appreciate your work..

Advice will be to bring transparency, give promotions on Merit","no growth, no job satisfaction, no learning, no value of work in Outside market"," "

b)  Stunning level of politics. Merit is no longer a consideration. Insecure/Arrogant senior management is more focused on surrounding themselves with mediocre cronies.

c) Massive exodus of talent. Most of the technology team has quit as mentioned by other reviewers. Same trend beginning to appear in research/analytics.

d) Lack of transparency and honesty (a marked change from the pre-2009 times). Management can't stop sending ""communications"" but these are almost always irrelevant (except for informing about yet another restrucring and/or senior level exit).","You are a disgrace.
