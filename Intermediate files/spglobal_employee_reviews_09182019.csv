There are still senior managers who do not allow staff to work from home but they work from home often. Middle managers are then left to explain to junior staff why most of the company, industry and their own senior leader are allowed to work from home but they are not.

The corporate culture behaves like a small, ""start-up"" 100 person organization.  Everything is ""hodge-podge"" and there is no corporate foundation in terms of corporate structure including no corporate policies and standards (thus businesses and corporate have no direction or mandates and just do whatever they want), HR job positions and career bands are not setup and have 50 years of various, archaic, outdated HR positions so in HR system everyone has some crazy title that does not even come close the titles listed on their external or job posting, thus very hard to determine upward career path/promotions.  

The lack of legitimate corporate hierarchal Senior Leadership positions such as a formal ""CIO"" etc. who make global Technology decisions create more dysfunction and poor direction. 

Lastly, most of the management level ""Directors"" and higher have very little leadership and solid global experience.  As a result, very poor management causing toxic culture and very high turnover especially in Colorado offices.  This place is simply being ""used"" as a ""stepping stone"" for people who want a better title before the move on usually within a year or so.","Completely restructure your SVP, VP  roles so there are improved reporting functions and accountability. More importantly, mandate formal processes to be developed and implemented PRIOR to trying to automate and implement technologies.  Bringing in tools as a quick fix to try to mature wont work as your internal departments and functions have no idea what each other are doing and they cannot even explain if you ask them.

If you are lucky enough to last six years and the grueling daily commute doesn't kill you, you will probably see so much upheaval, process change and outsourcing as to make your hiring company unrecognizable.

This archaic, paper-wasting culture is perpetuated by old executives who are stuck in their old ways. There is also a tremendous amount of outsourcing in this company and each entity is terrible at communicating with eachother, so this leads to an unnecessary amount of extra leg work, which is placed on the shoulders of the support staff. There are also no real checks and balances in place to address bad managers. There are plenty in this company and their bad behavior is often rewarded with promotions. I had the misfortune of working for a very ""green"" executive, who was very insecure and afraid to question old habits and enforce a new way of doing business there.

Big company, definitely opportunities to be very visible if you are so inclined.","Lots of change going on now as corporation is splitting into 2 separate companies. The split has been difficult and created additional stress for employees who are already under significant stress levels. The split is not surprising in that the company is rooted in business that are stale and facing significant changes in the future (text books, advertising, financial ratings, etc.). The company has done a decent job of communicating as much as they can about the split but still, very stressful for most. 

On a day to day basis, each individual unit of the corporation is their own little company so it's hard to speak for what working at the corporation is like; I can only speak for my experience. In the Construction Group, where I work, new management is in place. Very ""rah rah"", but the reality on a day to day basis, it feels a bit like ""slave labor"" and you've never really done enough. Very high expectations, which is ok, but bordering on unreasonable at times. Instead of encouraging, senior management seems to thrive on ""humiliating"". Very few pats on the back and quite a few kicks in the butt. It's clear for most of the highest senior management in the group that work is their #1 life priority, but the reality is that for most of their employees, family is what comes first. I'll never forget hearing the CEO of the Construction Group in a town hall meeting saying ""I support the whole work/life concept, but...""; in other words, he doesn't support the work/life concept. If you're leaving at 5 pm it will definitely be noticed. You're expected to put in long hours.

I will say in the last year, all Construction employees received a nice bonus as the group achieved their financial objectives. I can't complain about this obviously but one thing that was odd was that this came as such a surprise. I would think that employees would have been encouraged as we reached the final quarter of the year that this bonus was a possibility as our goals were in reach, thereby motivating everyone to work harder. Instead, it came out of nowhere after the year was over and the communication about it just seemed lacking.","Just treat people with respect. We all want to succeed and we all are working hard. Many of us have gone from having full staffs to running entire departments by ourselves. Try and be encouraging. Encouragement doesn't come from yelling at people, talking down to people, humiliating people. Acknowledge what we are doing, if we aren't doing something you think we should then just try and understand why and what the issues are.

The segment talks a very good game regardign the future, but the needed activities didn't always take place at the ground level.",Spend more time  planning future revenue streams/alternative businesses; spend more time building concensus within the segment.,At a crossroads
S&P Global,11/4/2008,The benefits are well laid out and you recieve good compensation,"no diversity, all male white male run - it's like working for a 1960's republican convention","Stop being so stuck up and firm and take the time to honestly consider your employees as human beings, not robots","McGraw-Hill is a robotic, contradicting, unjustified company"
S&P Global,10/12/2008,"The benefits package is really great, and once in the job security is decent.  They also really do have alot offer in their work-life program.","The in-house communication is really lacking sometimes, but they know it and are trying to work on it.
The companies move to out-source some aspects of our work does not seem to be a good idea to me.  The problems it brings up more than out-weighs whatever cost saving there are.
My only other real complaint is their never-ending use and lack of appreciation for Kelly employees.","Hire the Kelly employess who have shown their worth.  It is unfair to them to keep them as temporary employees for years at a time.  They can be hired as project status, and it would probably actually cost the company less.",McGraw-Hill good place to work with great benefits
S&P Global,10/2/2008,Co-workers are good at what they do.,"Senior management Grade levels 23 and above are more concerned with politics and lobbying for position than getting the job done.  Seems that the senior management would prefer to increase their salaries and ensure their positions are secure than to really work on making things right for their investors.

Every 6 months we see a reorganization happen and these reorgs don't happen because of the on-boarding of a new market, but to make the powers that be have a chance of hiding the fact that most of the management (senior) are ineffective.

MHP spends money on projects that are just not needed for could be done cheaper someplace else.  Customer service in NJ, analysts in NY,  the new data center, staffing costs in NY, the use of union workers and the list goes on and on.","Pull your heads out of your ass and start doing your jobs.  Listen to people who work there and get them to trust the company.

Move most of the operations and infrastructure out of New York and New Jersey.",MHP needs new senior managers.
S&P Global,10/2/2008,"Co-workers are intelligent, job can be interesting. If you're retired or independently wealthy, the job could be fun for you.","Company is totally bottom-line oriented, everyone is a temp, compensation is not competitive, management is secretive. Don't expect to be rewarded for doing a good job. Your pay can and will be cut from project to project, regardless of performance. The company requires a Bachelor's degree to be an evaluator, yet the pay is on a par with what you would expect with a high school diploma.","Pay better, improve communications, restore pay cuts. Reward good performance with monetary incentives, not just praise.",The bottom line is the only line they respect.
S&P Global,9/25/2008,"At this juncture and the way this company is headed, I can't think of any. The certainly have become greedy to the point they have literally cut out every generous jester they have ever made. I understand that even the contributions they previously gave to the needy during the holidays is greatly reduced. They made more than a billion dollars in profit in 2007, and like a shark smelling blood, are focused on improving that figure. This will be done at the cost of the employees.","If you are unlucky enough to be placed under an unfair or biased manager, you make be stuck there for many many years with no way to get out. Internal managers always ask current managers for their experience with an employee before consideration for promotion. If your current manager doesn't like you, he WILL make sure you are unable to leave his department.  Since HR has been outsourced for the most part you have no source of help.","Take some of the management courses you continue to force on others. Since most of MH senior management is hired externally, they have no previous knowledge or experience about MH policy, yet they are given any training in this respect. 
Also stop trying to make a name for yourself at the cost of your staff. Most likely you are new to MH, but your staff has had to prove themselves for years to every other 'new' sr. manager!","Watch your back, MH management will do anything to justify and keep their jobs, even if it means lying."
S&P Global,9/7/2008,"Large company, so many internal opportunities develop across other groups. Opportunity for stock based compensation which can be rewarding but which has changed dramatically in recent years.","Company has become addicted to layoffs. Obviously these are difficult times for the publishing industry and S&P has had their well publicized problems, so it's naive to think that there won't be reductions in work force. However, there is little logic behind who is laid off. There are many ""do nothings"" at MH who have been there for 25+ years who would give anything to be let go and get a package so they can retire. Inevitably, those are the ones who are spared, and the people who actually do the work are often let go. Morale in the company is at rock bottom. Every year, in late November/early December, dozens of your peers will be let go. Happy Holidays! Again, I don't expect this not to happen, but it almost seems as if the company has become mean spirited about it. I know of one woman who was out for a year on disability due to a serious illness, cancer. She was let go within 6 months of coming back. And this was a lower level employee who did not make a lot of money. In other words, the company probably didn't even save anything by letting her go. Also, when you are told that you have to let one of your employees go (and no, they won't listen to your reasons why you need this person or why they are a valuable contributor to the group), you are specifically told you cannot say the words ""I am sorry"". Heartless. Again, morale is rock bottom as a result of these annual layoffs. But senior management doesn't understand something unless it is a number on a balance sheet.","Look beyond the numbers when you make decisions. Do a real employee survey to see what people think of the company and be honest with the results. Think long term. You make decisions which benefit the year, but you don't think of the longer term impact of these decisions. Think productivity has dropped since you started aggressively laying people off every year? Well it has.",It's all about the numbers.
S&P Global,8/26/2008,"The benefits (medical dental, vision) cannot be beat.  The prescription plan offers super cheap co-pays for generic drugs.  The company prides itself on being one of the top 10 companies for working women (according to Working Mother magazine), but this is a relatively new outlook.  Twenty years ago a working mother had little more than six-weeks maternity leave as a benefit.  Now there is family leave and resources for finding day care and sick-child care.  They also offer elder care help.  M-H has a liberal work/family policy including flex-time.  They offer tuition reimbursement and have a generous vacation and floating days policy.","There are few advancement opportunities with most major positions filled by outsiders who rarely stay with the company past their 2-3 year contract.  Meanwhile, people in the organization who have started at the bottom and worked their way up get stuck in middle management for years on end.  These are the people who know the company and know the customer and because they are valuable in their present position, they are left there to stagnate.  The people who do advance do so not because of their talents, but more likely because of their lack of vision-they don't rock the boat.  Most of the MH offices are in the field with some offices having less than 15 employees.  These offices and employees are the back-bone of this company but are the least appreciated and the least compensated.","Senior management needs to listen to the people on the front lines!  These employees deal with our customers on a daily basis; they know their names, their goals for their companies and their complaints about MH.  A lot of changes are made with little or no regard how these will affect the customer or, for that matter, the MH employee.   Too much emphasis is put on the bottom line.  I have seen customers leave MH because changes were made that did not address their needs.","People in the field ARE part of this company, too!"
S&P Global,8/10/2008,"McGraw-Hill has great benefits and strives to make a good work life balance for all it's employees. The pay in New York, at least, appears to be somewhat competitive with a fair sick and time off policy.","The corporate structure of the corporation is still stuck in a 1950s mentality and there still is a large portion of employees at all levels have worked the company for 20 or more years--this harks back to the one workplace in your career. I think the corporation realizes it needs to adapt to the changing ways of a younger generations, but is very slow to do this. The reason, is that a lot of the senior management is from the old school and less likely to adapt. If they don't start making better opportunities for the younger generation to move up in the work force, they will be left behind.","See above. As much as the senior management like to portray an image of adaptability to its stock holders and clients, it's not all that. Perhaps it is in the education field where it has been quick to adopt new technologies and such, but in the work force it still has a way to go.","Good benefits, slow at change"
S&P Global,8/1/2008,"The employees' benefits are good and very family oriented. This is one of a few companies still with pension plans. The 401K matching is good. The company allows new employees to rent a temporary place before they find the permanent one. Also, the company would allow employees to hire a temporary nanny in an emergency situation.","There is always poor communication between management level and executive level. The executive level doesn’t know who the hard working people are. Some systems and programs are really old and people are hesitated to modify or renew them. Also, the medical/dental plans graduately decrease with higher co-payments.","Even some people in senior management are ready to retire in this company, they still need to sell their groups.",A good place to work for fresh graduates or ready-to-retired.

The newsroom is mostly run by people who worked at SNL (a company S&amp;P bought that did analysis type work).

This has been going on for more than a year. Even at journalism conferences people are confused that S&amp;P has a newsroom. It's been literal years since it launched, but no one outside of an incredibly select few have ever produced something worthwhile, so it continues to go unknown while much newer newsrooms have steadily built readership.

S&P Global Market Intelligence,5/31/2018,"S&amp;P for many, many years was a great employer with a multitude of reasons to work there. The work was engaging. The benefits were generous. And there was real quality of life at the company. Once the leadership from SNL was put in charge, all of that came crashing down.","Diminishing benefits, Verbal Abuse, Age discrimination, Out-sourcing all jobs.

SNL has turned this company into the lowest level of a work environment. Employee perks disappeared quickly. It's a bring your own office supplies environment, which I find unconscionable. I was in a hiring manager presentation that told us to ask whatever we want to identify the highest performers, but make sure to shred anything written so the Mike Chinn doesn't get sued.

I also witnessed and tried to stop male employees getting grossly larger raises and bonuses than more talented female colleagues. It's a bro atmosphere on every level. In fact, if you check the states, there are very few women in real positions of influence at the company. This was acknowledged and bandied about in multiple meetings.

S&amp;P is now SNL in disguise and has adopted their well-known persona of acting like a sweat shop. You can't imagine what a fall it's been from being a quality employer to one that forces out long-term employees to hire younger cheaper ones. Their claim of pay-for-performance is code for mandated bad reviews, unwarranted performance improvement plans, and an all-around demeaning of the people that work there. It's both sad and.... criminal.",I've got about nothing here. Management isn't listening. Good people are losing their careers.

It's quiet, and editors and reporters just sit at the computer like robots,  racing against time to meet the daily quota. 

Even though it claims to pursue ""journalism"", it suffers a severe identity crisis. It is trying to be both a Bloomberg/Reuters-type quick-paced newswire and an in-depth analytical publisher utilising proprietary data. Because of this lack of direction and focus, there is no system in place to train/guide the reporters  - the managers have no idea what kind of training is necessary. 

I've never been in a newsroom where the sole responsibility lies in the reporter, and the editor screams at you for a single spelling mistake and marks you down for non-substantial mistakes, even though they have also played a part in the product. A lot of energy is used on blaming and pointing fingers. The assessment system is designed based not on the quality and value of the content of the article, but on administrative factors such as whether the reporter remembered to attach source documents.

Worst of all, it does everything it can to ensure constant insecurity among the reporters.","Find focus,  quit encouraging a culture of insecurity and unhealthy competition, establish a proper training system,  place full responsibility on the editors -- they are not just keepers of the reporters but have some value-adding to do

The biggest problem for US employees' future prospects is that the division has a ""hiring freeze"" that only seems to be in the US. This existed throughout my employment there, and didn't seem to extend to India, where we were rapidly staffing up. 

The majority of the division's tech staff is in India. On top of being a ""low cost location"" (salaries being about 1/5th of the US equivalent), an increasing amount of developers were being hired there. QA was entirely in India. It's very difficult to interface with people whose days hardly overlap with EST Americans and whose English skills vary widely.

At some point, before I left, we began to receive these emails from the head of the Market Intelligence (MI) platform extolling the virtues of crunch time (working weekends, removing all bugs, etc.), for the platform that was badly behind schedule. These emails went on for a full two months before, management ultimately decided to push back the release at least four months, but probably more.

When unrelated teams kept getting pulled in, MI showed off the fact that it was five year old tech that had been reskinned to sell to management, but with an increasing amount of ""low cost location"" labor behind it.

From the technology perspective, ciq employees feel things that we should build are bought from market and vice versa, but we need some more time to understand this better.

SNL teams market themself heavily - certain CIQ areas are criticised without understanding details thoroughly and ciq employees having hard time since people aren't listening, they can't go aggressive also as there is fear of elimination, same time SNL teams are very aggressive since they have backing so working environment for middle managers is not so great at the moment.

Yikes. Where to begin...
I was put on the mapping team that mainly consisted of legacy members. I applied for a ""Test Engineer II"" position and was offered a position as ""Test Engineer I"" with an on-boarding plan involving me moving up to the next level in a given timeline, which I reluctantly accepted.

After the first few months, I found myself trapped in a stagnant state of under-compelling work that left me feeling anything but motivated. I made several attempts to approach my manager during this time asking if there was anything I could do such as acquiring certifications or external work to ensure I could stay on track with the original plan. This was constantly swept under the rug and ignored. 

During the first round of performance reviews, I was falsely accused of not performing a full 40 hours of work during certain weeks of the year. The accusations were brought on by another tester on the mapping team that I suspect was threatened by my presence. I had no choice at this point to bring HR into the picture while meeting with my manager to clear my name. After enough long-winded meetings, my manager finally admitted on the record that these allegations had no proof or evidence, and that I was not fudging hours on my timesheet. Shortly after these incidents, I received a poor performance review. When approaching my manager about it, all he claimed was that it was as result of a ""Stack Ranking"" system which made him feel ""forced"" into giving me this inaccurate and poor rating.

Although I remained miserable for the next few following months, I gave one last attempt to bring up my concerns to my manager. I informed him that I felt more rewarded for silence than with engaging my ideas with my team. I told him how unhappy I was and how unfairly I thought I was being treated. His reaction to this was to tell me that it was probably the ""Right approach"" to stay quiet and under the radar and perhaps I would eventually feel better after enough time. Needless to say, I started applying for another job immediately following that meeting.

To shed some light on my qualifications and work ethic, I'm now employed at a much better place where I feel engaged, challenged, and rewarded for my work. I've gotten a tremendous amount of positive feedback from my team here, and received a raise after my first few months at the company. I'm not just some angry clock watching worker-bee trying to put in a bad rep of S&P Global for the sake of it. I was legitimately miserable, bored, and mistreated my entire time there.","As an educated female millennial, I felt that this was the most unwelcoming environment imaginable for young and passionate talent. I would have appreciated management giving me an unbiased and sincere attitude when approaching them about my concerns and unhappiness. It was clear my manager only cared about particular team members that had been around longer solely because he based an employees value on their collected knowledge of the team and product.

They lure you in with promises of advancement and high profile projects. There are lots of phony promises made . The reality is that you work on many projects that are ill-conceived and unprofitable. Its hard to market on your resume that you spent a year working on a project that was either scrapped because of the never-ending management changes or it was unprofitable because its not marketable.  The firm creates products without asking the customer if they would buy it.  Many research reports either have little viewership or creates no value for clients. Most of the MD's are out of their league, all talk  and just fake it by being loud and obnoxious.  It you show any initiative or offer alternative strategies, you risk being made redundant..  HR is also totally useless and has no backbone -  complaints have been made against some managers but HR does nothing to protect the employee.   Some managers may have personality disorders which  makes the daily workday difficult for employees but HR will not help.  If you want to succeed there, just suck up to management but don't do anything to stand out.  Just be political.  Promotions, bonuses and job stability depend on cronyism and favoritism.  Lastly, there is little investment going on now which means that the company will likely fall behind competitors - the key IT platform keeps crashing and hasn't been updated for years.","Get a clue!

S&P Global Market Intelligence,7/25/2011,Capital IQ was a great experience for me.  I learnt a lot and had the opportunity to be part of a fast growing organization within a larger enterprise.  Capital IQ was and is well respected in the financial community and has good name recognition (although somewhat less known here than in the US where it was founded.),"Earlier this year, all of the senior managers left upon disagreements with the parent company about future direction.  Previous turnover had been almost none in many years.  Capital IQ used to be a coherent, complete organization and has been broken apart and included in a larger part of Standard and Poors.  The passion for the business has gone and, whilst the new leadership at the Capital IQ level may have its heart in the right place, the same cannot be said for the next level up.","Although some changes to align with overall direction are understandable, do not lose what made Capital IQ able to compete and grow so successfully for a long time against much larger players.","Passion, potential and longterm opportunity gone; standard S&P mentality arrived with departure of old managment."
S&P Global Market Intelligence,6/21/2011,"They are willing to promote people quickly, although this generally means that positions needing experience and qualifications are held by unqualified staff.","They love to talk about how scrappy they are, but the complete opposite is the truth - there's no energy or buzz in the office, it's like working in a retirement home which is bizarre considering most employees are in their twenties.","Make decisions, stop talking all the time and doing nothing.",Friendly on the face of it but not so nice if you get on the wrong side

S&P Global Market Intelligence,9/6/2009,"Capital IQ has very lax dress codes. On a hot summer day, it's common to see employees in sandals and shorts. Capital IQ, from time to time, has these 'Townhall' meetings on Fridays (typically) where employees, management, owners of the company get together for beers. These 'townhall' meetings usually coincide with important milestones of the company such as a big software release or the end of a raving month for sales. Management is generally OK with people taking their vacation at any time as long as you let them know ahead of time (a month or so, the earlier the better).","Employees, save managers and senior employees, don't get the respect they deserve. You can and will get funny looks. Occasionally, one may even be made a laughing stock (literally). The lack of professionalism in this respect is rather shocking. Ongoing popularity contests are part and parcel of the work environment here. In order for employees to gain recognition, they *will* have to engage in small talk involving baseball and the like, as well as going out to bars with senior managers. As a result, employees who do not fit in culturally are ostracized, and often have to endure subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) hostility in a less-than-diverse work environment.

Senior employees and management are very self-centered in their approach to problems and ways of doing things. They are generally unaware of this. Alternative ideas or suggestions are often shot down almost purely due to this factor.  Management has poor (over-aggressive) estimates for project management. Quality-assurance teams are completely out-sourced. Communication barriers and time zone differences can lead to frustrating and inefficient debugging cycles. CIQ doesn't have formal employee training. Their philosophy is similar to how eagles teach their younglings how to fly - survival of the fittest.

Senior leadership are all SMEs and/or salespeople but almost all poor managers and leaders, much happier when commenting on industry trends than on profits and costs.    Vendors and business partners almost entirely hate working with Platts due to lack of performance, slow decision-making and some unmerited corporate arrogance.

S&P Global Platts,9/27/2017,"Decent pay, good job security and when you are green it can give you great insight and experience into commodity trading. You might learn how to be a journalist too. For editorial staff it is a v important role in the market place that can give access to senior figures. Solid on the CV, but only if you want to be a junior analyst in Switzerland at a commodity trading house or work for a competitor. If you are lucky you get in to an exchange.  You do make friends for life though. A good place to start your career and certainly no easier sales place to be than here. Big marketing budget.","Bureaucracy - layers of it and no one understands the roles, rules or functions. Compliance functions staffed with people that (mostly) have no experience of the business and haven't done the job (apologise to those that have). Get them working a content job to understand the pressure and pain of systems they design.
Content - front line roles have no sense of meaning, autonomy and the compliance rules mean staff are treated like children. Necessary for compliance? It may be, but it doesn't feel like it is YOUR job. Millennials will find this the hardest bit as Platts' graduate recruitment plan shows.
Strategy - sales strategy is to exercise Platts' power in a de facto monopoly. Client base for price reports is going down. So the general practice has been to squeeze the biggest clients for more money and offer them some analytics or price reports they don't need. This creates client distaste for the organisation as many many people have commented on here.  Great for shareholders. Not great for customer facing roles. Only going to get worse as sales try and force Analytics offerings that the company has purchased  down Platts' clients throats. 
Product management - paralysed. Haven't launched a new revenue-generating product for years and the technology from the companies that were bought was left to wither on the vine. Generally they are hamstrung by a decision-making process that no one understands and crippled by fear of losing revenue.
Marketing - Excellent, but (as noted by many in the organisation) they end up marketing products the company doesn't sell. That's because the products the company does sell (PDFs) look dreary.
Management - Micromanagement is high with senior to middle managers left with little authority bar being a conduit for minor decisions(big decisions don't get made). Too many times do people ask for guidance only for managers to kick decisions upstairs. There is an uncomfortable succession-planning process where every employee is rated on an overly simplistic scale of 1-4. Managers with little knowledge of employees often have a big say in a rating process that can harm careers long after that manager has departed. Feels underhand. Ask your manager what yours is if you work there.
Career prospects - Like any corporate beast it is good if you pick up the lingo, curry favour and don't challenge the status quo.  Listening to the colourful tall stories farmed out by senior management, (which I guess is meant to be inspirational) can be torturous though so a rhino skin and a sense of humour is important.
Culture - too many people with not enough work to do in some areas leads to gossip and office politics. As many have noted in here, the politics is really really bad. That's partly due to a complicated reporting line structure that very few people understand and causes distraction.","Get a management consultancy in to tell some hard truths. Hire people who are experts in compliance to minimalise the impact of pending regulation.  Try hiring managers that have had success in their careers at other places. Ask yourself - do we really need all this staff that don't really produce content, sell it or market it?",Bloated & paralysed with an odd corp. culture

You could get work done in a structured way and was thanked for delivery.  There was heated discussion but we moved forward and past disagreements buried.

There are a lot of talented people and a lot of very good storytellers there that can make life interesting and throughout my time there I never once had that dreaded feeling of having to go into work.","However, the longer I stayed I saw that the company did not promote success, but rather the opposite.  If you failed and failed badly, but were able to scamper away to another part of the business, while blaming others for your failure, you were safe.

If you missed your deadlines, but were able to put a nice powerpoint together that explained why you had only delivered a fraction of what you had committed to deliver to, you were safe

There was one Senior Managet who no one in their team actually knew what they did, but they talked such a good game, the C-Suite would talk in awe of them.   

Management only in it for their own benefit, and are frightened of rocking boats, in case they find their own name in the firing line, so content to let projects drift aimlessly with nothing being delivered, biding their time till they can jump to the next role and leave their mess behind for someone competent to clean up.

Projects left to drift, with no one stepping in, culling the project leadership and starting afresh. No brave new blood, rather a rehash of ineffectual middle management muddling along in the vain hope they will be able to deliver something, someday, somewhen.","Be brave.  When you see a ship steering off course, challenge that Captain of the ship.   Ask them why they have under delivered against what they have committed to deliver.

If they continue to do this, don't wait for it to really go awry, step in earlier, remove them, and if necessary, remove their manager.

The work was usually interesting and the staff was diverse and a fun team to be in. Oil dominates the company and it was good to see how the markets work and have such access to so many people who knew so much especially industry participants like traders etc. The pay was ok for what I was doing but some of the work could be repetitive as there were many daily tasks to be done. All in all it was a good job at a good place and clearly the market leader in its limited field.,Apart from the occasional repetitiveness the main bad point was with a group manager who I found to be somewhat dishonest. This person was a good speaker and leader but clearly making up big parts of their life story like being in the army when they obviously wasn't or stuff like being a sports coach when it was very unlikely! Their story would change so often that I lost faith in the leadership and it was part of the reason I started to look at other roles.

S&P Global Platts,9/15/2013,"The company matches the pay of oil broking companies to discourage their reporters from moving out into the industry. And it works as most of my ex-colleagues who are smart enough to qualify working in a trading house were dissuaded by the pay cut from jumping onto a trade support role. 

Loads of opportunity to network and travel or to speak in conferences. 

You also learn a lot from the sources in the industry and also from the Managing Editors/seniors who can be knowledgeable. This is the case in Singapore at least. 

I think the most valuable for me is learning about the energy pricing, trade flows, economics, and other factors that energy traders care about the most.

A major pro is that, by conducting analysis, primary research and due diligence, reporters generate relevant content and it's not something insubstantial - there's a reason why analysts and brokers copy these articles in their internal reports after all. Information gathering is a relevant skill and is one thing that the industry sadly overlooks when they see a Platts reporter. 

The managers are encouraging and nurturing, and will ensure that you get the proper training before you represent the company in the industry.

The job is not for the faint-hearted and is thus a good character-building experience - you can encounter objections (sometimes nasty confrontations) on your price assessments.","As a reporter, it was tough for my hard work to be appreciated by the industry if the pricing methodology is somewhat flawed - not that there's a viable or robust substitute in the first place anyway.

There's also a growing lack of confidence from external sources on the quality of reporters who have become complacent after benchmark status of their product has been fully established.

The learning curve can be truncated by the nature of the market you're covering. Sources share information in so far as it benefits them. In some (or most?) markets, opacity is money and this is the case where there's limited opportunity for learning. 

It is a news organization and so (1) it can be very stressful on certain days when something major happens, and (2) relationships within are the core and the people who are not necessarily capable but are good in talking BS and sucking up to management can get very very far. As with huge organizations, relationships are key and the politics can be bad.

In many cases people who were absolute top performers were affected. Most of these layoffs were handled very impersonally, in mass meetings of several to a dozen people all at once. In many cases the affected people's managers were never consulted or even informed until later. Although leadership will give reasons related to improving process and the like, everybody understands it is primarily for cost reasons, despite S&amp;P being an extraordinarily profitable company. The result is that the analytic staff is getting very junior, and the senior people are all very worried. This is a reputation-driven business, where customers want to feel that their analysts are experienced and know their business really well. S&amp;P leadership is betting that the franchise is strong enough the get away with gutting the ranks of senior analysts, managers, and risk management people without damaging their reputation or deal flow. The result is lower morale among experienced staff and more voluntary departures, as people no longer feel that strong performance provides stability to their career at S&amp;P.","Most of senior leadership has never rated a bond issue; they have never walked in analysts' shoes. They shouldn't be surprised if analysts feel they are out of touch. The President seems unaware that certain of his key senior leaders are reviled by the rank and file, hurting morale and the President's credibility. I recommend that the President reach down through a few layers of staff frequently, create a safe environment to listen one-on-one with trusted and experienced staff, to understand how people really feel about his leadership team and its actions.","Great company for entry level staff, but is laying off waves of senior people"

The essential nature of the ratings business has not changed much in decades (though there has been evolution to allow rating of new products). They have few competitors and the barrier to entry into the ratings business is high. Senior management appear to have limited fear of disruption by new players. Consequently, this is not a very dynamic company. It's slow to change, slow to adopt new ideas and technology, and the incentives for excellence are modest in comparison to highly competitive industries. This permeates all aspects of the business, and can be frustrating for motivated employees seeking to innovate and advance through merit 
o	Merit is recognized most of the time, but as with many large financial companies, politics play a disproportionate role in career advancement
o	Continuous turnover of senior IT management in recent years has made life difficult for all IT staff. Priorities and strategic direction are in constant flux
o	Emphasis on off-shoring and near-shoring has lengthened workday and made project execution more challenging for many NYC based IT staff
o	From an IT perspective, S&amp;P is generally playing catch-up when it comes to the latest tech: not the place to be if you want to be at the bleeding edge
o	Regulation and past blunders have created a ton of red tape around software development &amp; deployment, to the point where innovation and creativity often get compromised by laborious, unwieldy and ever expanding processes
o	S&amp;P IT leaders have tried to implement Agile repeatedly, and if questioned would say that Agile is the methodology used for development. In practice, the business rarely accepts this, and IT staff often get caught in the worst of two worlds: the delusional ""fixed-time/fixed-scope/fixed-price world"" of business leadership who initiate and fund the projects, and the ""theoretical Agile world"" of IT leadership who execute the projects", ,Honest Insights into 15 Years at S&amp;P

Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC,5/10/2017,It's a job. The office had vending machines. You get to go home at the end of the day.,"I worked in the Colorado office, which for whatever reason became the destination for the editorial team, despite the main work being done in New York. This caused endless problems. Real access to management was almost non-existent. On-site management was virtually absent (constantly out to lunch, in conference meetings with NYC, taking copious days off, etc) and the NYC management would endlessly pass the buck; any attempt to ask questions or contact them was met with suggestions to ask another person, who invariably would also not be available. Training on the complex processes was extremely poor.  Communication between teams was beyond poor, and it was common for management to simply give the silent treatment to employees they weren't satisfied with, rather than addressing the issue as adults. Favoritism and petty politics abounded. Layoffs were common and led to tasks being delegated to editorial that should not have been. As a result, the job as I was ultimately asked to perform was not the job I applied for, interviewed for, or felt that I was signing up to do. When beginning a job at S&P, go in actively expecting that it has been falsely advertised to you. 

Technical problems were a constant. The software we used barely worked on the very best of days. All the IT and tech support was outsourced to India. Though the overseas support people did their best, there were obvious barriers (many barely spoke English) and they rarely seemed to know much about S&P, let alone understanding much of the work we did. The programs would crash constantly and make it virtually impossible to meet deadlines.

1.  The business can be described as a ""factory"" that produces ratings.  As an employee, your job is to follow a set process to produce a rating, and then repeat the process over and over again.  There is little room for independent thought or creativity.  Anyone can do the job, so there is not much value for being smart or ambitious.  
2.  There's limited career advancement.  Expect to do the same thing over and over again until you find a new job.  No idea how promotions are made.  Some competent people sky rocket and other competent people float around in limbo. The organizational structure is also very top heavy, so not much room for younger employees to rise.  
3.  Upper level management is not competent.  We have high turnover (often to much smaller ratings agencies like Kroll, which has taken more than a few RMBS analysts) and declining market share.  Classic symptoms of poor management.  
4.  Management keeps creating new processes and organizational changes that make doing my job much harder.  Everything requires more approval and more forms to fill out.

The classes are usually about 10-20 (at least in the New York office). 2) The analysts all start with a training program. This training gathers all analyst from all major S&P offices around the world and invites world-class NYU professors to teach finance, analysis, etc. 3) This program is an acceleration program in terms of corporate hierarchy. You can start as a research assistant, but it will take you AT LEAST a couple years to be at an analyst level. 4) Analysts in the US come from usually econ, finance backgrounds from east coast schools ranging from Rutgers to Yale. 5) The unique aspect of this program is supposed to expose you to ALL FOUR of the major money-maker departments. It is designed to start as a summer intern in ONE department, and rotate through THREE departments after graduation (assuming you get an offer back). 6) The exit opportunities are expected to be good. Obviously this is a new program so there's not a huge alumni network from the CREDit program. S&P kinda expects and hopes you to stay after the program and choose one of the rotation teams.

Raises were steady, thanks to a longstanding relationship with the union. For me as a support staffer, work was enjoyable, stable, skill-promoting, and varied, without being frantic all the time. I was deeply dedicated and value my experience there.","The company has gone through many rounds of job cuts and outsourcing, swapping out businesses to new divisions not covered by the union contract. Support staff were reduced, the mail room was outsourced, graphic design was eliminated, and some managers seemed more inclined to pit people against each other. Considering that S&P generated three-fourths of McGraw Hill's profits, it was hard to understand why senior management would risk the quality of its products and work environment through turnover and job cuts to try to squeeze out ever more profits.

Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC,8/9/2008,"Depending on the specific department, the environment is generally laid-back. There is a good work life balance especially since middle managers and above are allowed to work from home at least twice a month. The senior managers are generally flexible with work hours and allow the employees to leave early as needed. There are also numerous career development opportunities including courses offered to improve industry knowledge. In addition, the various employee resource groups typically sponsor events on business topics and host mentoring programs for its members. The global presence of the company allows for employees to learn more about business operations in different offices across the world.","There are several downsides of working at S&P. Despite the emphasis on promoting employees from within the company, it is often not the case. Senior managers are usually hired from competitors which supposedly infuses the company with new and different ideas. However this is harmful for the employee morale when the new senior managers are absolutely clueless about the business operations of the company and blindly replicate the ideas that they used in their old company. If the idea was so powerful, why did they bother to leave their old company? Obviously there were problems with the idea to begin with. Secondly, the senior management have only looked at the financial statements when making decisions to lay-off their employees. Instead of focusing on cutting projects that are add no value, they decide to lay off groups that are instrumental to the daily operations of the company such as the mailroom and facilities group aka the same people that set up the laptop and projector for client meetings. They also tend to hire consultants who have no entrenched respect for the company - but I guess it doesn't matter as long as their salaries are lower than full-time employees.","The company has too many chiefs and not enough indians, to borrow a cliche. It is almost a joke for anyone with a title of Director or above because they do absolutely no work and create meaningless work for the people below them. It is difficult for senior management to cut the chiefs because they tend to be their ex-coworkers in previous companies. But ultimately, they must be eliminated from the company in order to allow for the hard-working employees to rise. Senior management needs to wake up and realize that the company is considered a joke by many investment firms. Spend more money on technology but please hire IT folks that actually know what they are doing and can speak English. It is difficult enough trying to call India for desktop support.
