Advice.to.Sr..Management
"Reward your staff and actually appreciate them, a couple of meetings to inform everyone wouldn't hurt. Updates on direction of where the business is going, higher pay"
 
 
 
Invest in IT
"Less middle management, more interaction directly with employees.  More transparency on career paths."
 
 
 
Value production teams brtter
 
 
 
 
 
 
Promote high achievers and grow the business so no more layoffs are needed
 
Get rid of the $50 award given to readers to spot mistakes. This gimmick results in scared reporting and weak writing.
"Try to finish layoffs and turn the corner on expanding the business.  At this point, there is no reason for any ambitious or talented person to attempt to build a long-term career at the company as there is no loyalty (due to the integration) and lack of long term vision (not sure about the Kensho acquisition.)"
 
 
Please look into what the management has been doing with their employees and train them on performance reviews
 
 
SNL folks you were small time before and you’re still small time with much bigger boots. Eventually you’re going to drown.
Make decisions with conviction. Take into account how to manage org structure put in place.
 
"Establish working groups with junior employees, give them ownership of certain IT/marketing/operations/strategy problems, set a deadline, and give them a chance to use a different part of their brain beyond their day-to-day function."
Work pressure is everywhere but paying attention to the concerns and issues of the employees is the need of the hour. Quick actions should be taken to regain the trust of employees. There is too much negative competition and colleagues are mostly non helping because they have also faced the same issue when they joined.
I've got about nothing here. Management isn't listening. Good people are losing their careers. The products are secretly failing with the transition to all out-sourced IT teams. Nothing good.
 
 
"Look to the people you still have left there and allow for true honest feedback.  And look for ways to keep the valuable resources you have in the company, instead of letting those resources go."
 
 
Value your employee a bit more and dont treat them like their an expendable resource... even if they are to you...
 
Nothing...
Stop making org changes all the time
 
Less dictating of decisions out of NYC...ask the other successful offices about strategies for success.
Do the company and it's shareholders a favor and exit the building immediately and don't look back before the only thing left is your oversized and undeserved compensation packages.
The addition of few strategic resources would generate a positive ROI as this would allow the commercial team more bandwidth to act more strategically.
"Focus on developing the people on this team, and open up more opportunities for them"
"Provide weekly feedback, especially when asked."
"At a minimum, act like the people that work for you are humans."
Be honest about outsourcing and try to stanch the administrative and American employment outflow.
"Stop experimenting with the S&P Ratings money, and these 3rd party attempts at a platform."
Keep up the good work!
 
Keep doing what your doing. Setting expectations and then keeping a hands of approach is a great motivator. Nice to see that I am expected to be responsible
Awesome job.
pay people what they are worth
 
 
 
"Take a look at the companies they are investing in for day to day functions, it seems the changes are because they are a friend of a friend and not for the wellbeing of the company.  Clients are starting to notice and will eventually go elsewhere.  It's time to take back the keys!"
Understand that non-SNL folks actually understood business as well as new SNL team.
 
 
 
Continue making S&P a one stop shop.
"Engage more with employees, even contracted employees"
Need professional management
"Acquiring and retaining top talent in all locations
Give engineers the tools and accountability as well as remove the restrictions 
Good engineers do not need guidelines and procedures to get the job done
Planning of company wide milestones needs the involvement of all  stakeholders else you will end up with unrealistic timelines"
Focus on getting things done right.
Listen more to mid level managers. They had a good sense of what was happening on an operational level.
"If you want to demonstrate value to clients, don't fire the experts."
 
Don't believe what recruiters tell you about unlimited sick days and flex work hours as promised by recruiters no work/life balance be ready to work on weekends. Long work hours and unrealistic deadlines. Your benefits wont start till after a month if your lucky it took me almost 2 months to get everything setup and I was working in HR.
 
Pick a leader from the industry who actually has run a huge organization and actually try to retain top employees instead of just using the statement as lip service.  Actions and your message often diverge.
Have ALL management take motivation training. My current manager is a massive bully who has threatened to fire people during meetings if they say something he doesn't like. He has also said on numerous occasions to several people that things they are working on better go well as their job depends on it.
 
NA
 
 
Provide better opportunities for the most talented employees or keep loosing them
people are the most valuable asset...we create financial and market info tech tools... give people a reason to want to build the best tools and you will have the best product in our space.
Increase bonuses for top performers
Focus more on people's professional development
 
"Pay for performance is doing 10 times bad for 70% employees, than it's helping little to 30, slowly affecting we're one team atmosphere too. Please think about it at corporate level. Earlier performance appraisal of team + individual + company used to help everybody keep motivated. Not all teams would have challenges all cycles , that also used to balance spikes easily.

Please try to address CIQ teams integration concerns on biased decisions, put honest efforts."
"There's a feeling of instability among the rank and file.   While keeping headcount down is good for the bottom line in the near term, getting too low has a negative impact."
 
Some advice to management would include - Management needs to take training classes to understand how to manage employees and help with career development.
"I wish there was something at this point that could be done, but the constant reorging and lack of stability are irreconcilable."
Learn what talent retention means. Your best talent is leaving or wants to leave badly while the overpaid contributing next to nothing are protected by senior managers in an environment that resembles a Hollywood high school movie. Anyone can box subpar products and slap a guarantee on it. Just ask Tommy Boy. Some of you also have a thing or two to learn about professionalism.
Show more compassion to your employees. Come up with a better way to measure performance; a way that's not subjective. Come up with a standard way to deal with situations.
 
"Be cognizant that this is a bigger company now, what worked in Charlottesville might not work in NYC/London/Hong Kong. Think big, monitor metrics but don't get consumed by them and focus on hiring the best people possible."
"As an educated female millennial, I felt that this was the most unwelcoming environment imaginable for young and passionate talent. I would have appreciated management giving me an unbiased and sincere attitude when approaching them about my concerns and unhappiness. It was clear my manager only cared about particular team members that had been around longer solely because he based an employees value on their collected knowledge of the team and product.

Also-- good luck with the next sucker you throw on the mapping team."
 
"pls invest in employee development and training, work culture needs a lot of improvement."
N/A
Try to nurture younger employees by promoting them into higher positions.
 
Create a system for promotions so employees can actually get a promotion without having to leave the company. Retention rates would skyrocket.
"Keep maintaining the same atmosphere and work environment. The acquisition has brought many exciting, new changes and if we can incorporate these and still maintain the atmosphere that made me love working at SNL, we'll be all set."
Keep your experienced workers!!!!!
diversify and give the emplo
 
"SNL folks need to show that they do care about retaining current employees, although they assured this in town halls, you really don't see them care about people, all you've been asked to do is to follow their procedure and finish the integration. That is a job for robots, we people need motivation once in a while to feel involved in the long term picture"
 
Have a communication skills class given.
Help IT members improve by offering certifications to those who have been with SNL for two years plus and have received good reviews.
"Reduce and simplify processes. Make people take end to end responsibilities, where developers talk to everyone all the way to product and sales."
Non existent.
 
 
Pay your employees a competitive salary according to their experience.
Keep up the good work!
Keep employees involved with new projects and faster works flows.  Moving projects more often can be helpful.
Fire the local management and start over.  Encourage employees by showing that hard work is rewarded.  Don't allow drug use in the office.
Ditch the forced distribution of performance ratings. Trust your management to fairly rate each employee
 
Promote from lower-levels!!
give better reviews
eliminate acquiring too many companies
Stick with one direction and go with it.
 
Encourage and promote high performers faster
"Create more opportunities for learning and advancement.
Management needs to be more transparent and honest."
 
Create more opportunity for internal growth from low grade levels.
 
 
 
 
 
 
"create clear strategy goals (1 year, 5 year etc) / identify top producers and promote / invest in training and company culture"
Respect/appreciate your employees and they will provide great performance and effort.
give account managers more exposure to sales cycle/ shadow time with sales directors. Everyone is on their own island- not a lot of teamwork even thought there are teams in place.
Stop allowing inexperienced managers to manage large groups of people - let them manage projects instead.  Also stop covering up bad business decisions by laying off talent since you cannot trust your managers to identify themselves as being the employees that need to be laid off.
More transparency to entry-level employees.
Pick a strategy and stick with it. Too much changeover in upper levels due to strategy misfires.
"Stop being hypocritical - lots of buzzwords that sound like major changes, but resistant to any actual progress"
Please resign and get some new management that understands capital markets
Improve upon the pros listed and eliminate where possible the cons mentioned.
 
keep it up!
"Try paying more if you want to retain a higher percent of employees. Also, tell the higher ups that day-long ""leadership training"" events are incredibly dull"
Needs to maintain stability in terms of products and employee count
"too many ""restructures"" will be disastrous"
 
 
"Invest in your talent.   At one time this company was run by executives who worked their way through the ranks and had a personal interest in the long term success of the company, now you are lucky if someone stays for a full year!"
"Take a step back and look at the big picture, instead of just profits, then maybe people will stay longer than 1-2 yrs at the company"
 
 
Embrace the culture of old (CIQ). Eliminate much of the P&C control that stalls and delays innovation and be more open to using partners to maximize the value of the data and to allow 3rd parties to innovate with us.
 
"Back off, let people do their jobs, technology management needs the big ole heave ho.  Bring in young, smart people, instead of old school boys club cronies."
Hire a team/managers that have plans instead of wasting time.
HR team and the interviewing policies need to revamped.
 
Lead by example
open up to other channels and listen more
 
"Execute the structural changes you know the business needs. Everything is in place to do that and while change is hard, opportunities like this don't occur often - seize the day!!"
Value employees to retain them longer in order to get well trained and knowledgeable people.
"Use better motivation tactics, not scare tactics"
 
 
"Long walk, short pier - take a hike
The management culture of any company is set by the executive suite - and this place surely suffered as a result.  As was mentioned in a recently held meeting amongst the senior management: Lou is a capable sales man, and should have stayed in sales....."
"Allow employees to take some risks to grow the company.  Otherwise, it guarantees mediocrity and inhibits growth."
Consider increasing compensation for teams that over perform.
 
"Make a better effort in recognizing that many of your long-standing employees actually ARE valuable, possess needed experience, clearly demonstrate loyalty, and really do add to the long term success of the company."
 
 
 
 
 
Company to create a career paths for people which can eliminate bias and conflicts.
"streamline the senior management by paying closer attention to the actual work being done by the so-called ""directors"" and ""senior directors""."
Promote more within the company.
"It's been 2 years since the re-org.  Stop ignoring the problems and writing them off as growing pains.  Instead, solicit feedback from all tiers of employees and take meaningful action to correct the issues."
Read the reviews.  React.
Pay attention.
Fire all and get a new management
Hire on merit for senior positions and not just based on past loyalties
Focus on ensuring there is a balanced scorecard on the key management team across all areas of the firm especially in areas where there is a greater than normal level of staff attrition.
Resign. You guys are so terrible it's helpless!
 
 
"Clean house if someone is doing a poor job.  Entitlement, and seniority should be cut off at inception."
"McGraw Hill needs to change management and create a culture that values and rewards it's employees from the bottom up.  The company needs to make a real investment in market research in order to better understand the needs and wants of customers in order to bring real, market driven products instead of forcing unwanted products to customers."
"Be upfront about the job people are applying for. I was an overachiever and even offered a promotion within the company which my boss blocked. It is a mess, don't work there."
None.
 
Stop sugar coating this position.  It is just a customer service job and let people know before day 1.
 
 
Get another floor! There is no space left for even new full time hires what more for interns!
"I cannot offer any. You've already destroyed what was once a great company. The fact that you do not even see what is wrong nor have done anything to address it is astounding. Just like King Midas, everything you've touched appears to be ""turned to gold"", when really, you've just permanently frozen everything. Yet all you see is gold and think you've done a wonderful job. Wake up and drink the coffee instead of the Kool-Aid. I hear they are still serving the Kool-Aid at TR.

I feel sorry for you when the customers finally realize how much your choices and actions have stifled a great platform and they leave..."
Stick the course -it's already much improved...
Cut all senior management and start new.
 
 
 
Provide more direction for new employees (it took me 6-12 months before I had any idea of what the role entailed).
 
"Wake up and realize that unless you start respecting (and paying) your top talent, its all going to leave the building.  You think losing 2-3 key people a week would send a signal."
Actually do something with all the feedback that you have instead of steamrolling everyone and accepting your losses.
 
Be upfront with development analysts about their real job.
 
Set product vision and then execute
Take more time to talk to employees and really listen to feedback.
"Be clear about the position, misleading people about the job description is why your employees want to leave!"
should hire more outside talent as management here has a very narrow view of the company and the world outside
"Management training is required.  It would also help to move away from being such a flat organization- it would help define roles more clearly and help hold people accountable.  One manager can not effectively manage 50 to 100 people. 
Processes need to be clearly defined.  Growth happened so fast now it's really time to take a look at how to streamline things and become more effective."
Have interns take on more responsibility.
With the recent reorganization you know the writings on the wall. McGraw-Hill will spin you off and sell Capital IQ. Unfortunately they will never be able to recover the inflated price they paid for you. Cents on the dollar!
Listen to your employees. There are many talented people in other cities besides NYC that are eager to participate and make the company better. People are your biggest asset; treat them so.
"Encourage and listen to feedback, keep dedication to resources and hiring good people"
Please try to give some value to employees working there.
Increase the level of professionalism amongst lower level employees. Promote diversity within the company. Provide more training for new employees.
"Try and create new markets, not just expand market share in already saturated markets.  The plan of taking away from competitors will only go so far."
 
 
Come clean and stop cheating your sales teams and  clients alike. Make a wholesale change now or expect to be replaced  like the buggy whip.
What's the point? No one is listening.
Continue to focus on improving employee engagement
 
N/A
 
Do right by your employees
I believe you already cleared out the key problem...
 
 
"Seriously look into how the ""kids"" are treated especially by the London managers. Work on establishing a fair and  balanced work place. Get rid of verbally abusive managers. It's time to grow up. I wish this was the American company that it use to be when I was hired."
 
None
"Work harder to reduce information barriers between offices and departments, enable faster change and implementation of projects"
Increase salary to be more competitive with industry peers; implement upgrades to technology at a faster pace so there are minimal disruptions for day-to-day work
Platts need to decide on a path and allow it to bake.  Get new organizational structure in place and then move full steam ahead.  Continue to improve internal technology enhancements for more repeatable processes.
 
 
 
"Focus more on quality of services.
Be more honest and straightforward."
Communicate with your employees. Don't make major shifts in strategy without walking employees through the reasons and what it means to them. Encourage collaboration and exploration - not one where employees are worried about making a mistake.
Be more straightforward about changes in company strategy and priorities. Management could do a much better job about communicating with employees about the company's direction.
 
"Review your policies, as I'm quite certain it's illegal to deny a severance package to someone who is sick when you lay them off."
You're the problem.
 
"Improve the relationship between business and technology. Find opportunities to leverage best-of-breed technology offerings, instead of S&P Ratings retreads. Consider technology career paths. Fix the vendor relationships, and they way they're managed."
 
Run your firm fairly.  Don't lead by intimidation. Pay your people a living wage. Worked here for years and made less every year. Over 1/2 of our group have resigned and started competing firms.
 
 
stop adding layers of management to increase efficiency
"Hire talent who can deal with a company growing quickly, work with different people, and empower employees. Get rid of managers who lack integrity as this contributes to the low morale and high turn over within Platts."
Make an effort to attract a more diverse group of people. Try to place more extroverted people in managerial positions.
"Maybe take more more care of your employees.  There is a general feeling that no matter what you do, it will not be recognized."
"Break the mold, find out-of-the-box thinkers, and quit kidding yourselves that rotating senior management among the franchises is effective."
 
Invest in employees before the franchise is ruined.
"Balance the needs of all stakeholders better. Employees are important stakeholders. By constantly burning employees, stockholders will ultimately be burned as well, though maybe not in the short term."
 
Increase salaries
 
 
 
Provide more career advancement opportunities for credit analysts
"even in a public company, you can cut too much"
"Treat ur employees well, they’ll take care of your business/customers."
"Most of senior leadership has never rated a bond issue; they have never walked in analysts' shoes. They shouldn't be surprised if analysts feel they are out of touch. The President seems unaware that certain of his key senior leaders are reviled by the rank and file, hurting morale and the President's credibility. I recommend that the President reach down through a few layers of staff frequently, create a safe environment to listen one-on-one with trusted and experienced staff, to understand how people really feel about his leadership team and its actions."
Fire poor managers at once.
 
 
None. You are what you are.
keep doing what you are doing
 
"In order for the company to be successful, you need right people in the right roles. There are strong junior and mid level managers that are good but senior managers are not very strong leaders."
- Don't let the old way of doing things stop innovation.
Share the company's success with your employees in tandem with shareholders
 
"People is your best asset. If there is no clear goals and clear communication, people will leave."
 
Protect talent
Let your knowledgeable employees help organize projects and define success.  Share accountability with them on projects.
There really isn't anything that can be said to management as they are most likely in the same boat and are working day to day in hopes they won't get cut.
Start walking the talk on culture and values
"Pick a leadership team and stick with it
Best way to improve morale is through compensation"
"Great talent leaving your company,  your competitors are treating your employees better than you.  S&P has great history,  Please open your eyes to save the talent."
"Take care of the talent you have, you will see soon enough that moving all support to India is not worth it."
Invest in better IT systems.
Reduce number of reorganizations. Promote from within.
"Suggest regular review of work, and responsiveness to requests"
"You want advice? You don't deserve advice! When I got stuck with a terrible manager, who would yell at me at my cubicle with dozens of peers in earshot (all confirmed by MANY peers under her as well), the ""proper channels"" did absolutely nothing about it, and it took me years to find our that ""HR partners"" for every department even exist!

Also, every 8 hour day is divided into 15 minutes real work and 7-3/4 hours justifying it via scrum stories, forms, test cases, etc., etc., all on the worker's own - absolutely no thought given to automating or streamlining anything. Focus on results more than process and protecting your butts!

Finally: your BS town halls full of inspirational philosophical crap are a complete waste of time and lies, and everyone knows it. Our cubicles are coffins squeezing ever tighter, even as you preach out-of-the-box and helping the company generally. It's totally laughable, you blithering idiots. Wake up by spending ""a day in the life of a developer"". No, a month!"
Keep engagement high
"Stop underestimating and undermining your current employees. We understand the value of change and know the business. Maybe the new leadership should learn the people and the business a little better. 

Before hiring outsiders to lead consider putting 'acting' managers in place to see if your existing talent can do the job before disqualifying them, you may be surprised how many diamonds you passed off as lumps of coal. 

Stop trying to out do one another. The biggest failure at teamwork is you!!  Shame on you all!"
 
Allow more room for employee growth.
Provide clear career path for the star analysts and take early action to correct nonperforming ones.
Wake up. Your own leadership team causes more harm than good.
 
 
Need a good balance
Get the vision going
 
 
Establish and manage by measurable objectives.  The majority of the employees in the IT department have no idea what their deliverables are.
Pick a mission/goal and stick with it. Invest in employee's education and happiness. Mentor new/young employees to help them grow skills.
The strategy for the management team is to to run for short term profit and no concern for the people side of the equation.
Show you care about people by giving the right incentive. Train your HR to treat all potential employees with basic respect. Don't be a bigot.
 
Keep up the good work
This department needs a complete restructure. Training methods are obsolete and mentors are left to train incoming analysts without much help or guidance from management.
"The situation: S&P has a brand name which affords huge value, as well as an infrastructure and senior management built over several decades.  Consequently,  senior management needs to to shake things up just the right amount--enough to thrive going forward without disrupting existing business."
 
Allow employers to advance or change in departments that make them more productive and happier.
 
Stop micromanaging your employees.
 
"Give employees a path to grow, or they will find growth elsewhere.  Get rid of a couple layers of management."
"Value your employees, you are losing top talent every day."
raise compensation
 
"Stop making constant changes, meet and support your employees. Emails about ACE awards is not enough. Make it a nicer place to work."
Focus on efficiency and cultivating the best analyst on Wall Street rather than expense mgmt
 
More accessibility and support for staff
 
"Give proper incentives to your employees outside of the analytical community, do a better job of linking skills to positions"
"Focus on profits and not just costs or revenues, ROI analysis is a real thing that for-profit companies find helpful.  Protect the core franchise by listening to and supporting your rating analysts.  On regulation, emulate the banks and open serious dialogues with the regulators and be prepared to teach them about the rating business and learn from them about risk management at the same time."
 
Invest in IT (data and workflow management). Simplify processes and methodologies. Work on improving employee morale.
Focus on identifying and retaining top talent
 
Take care of your people or they will run to the next decently paying opportunity out there
 
none
 
 
 
 
Pay attention to your customers and don't gauge them. At some point entities will have a choice about rating agencies and will not use the one where they were treated poorly.
"Listen to your employees , not dismiss them if they do not have a degree."
"Interview according more to the analyst program itself. Obviously the candidates need to have a general finance background, but don't ask questions that aren't reflective of the analyst program. I don't know why the management team feels the need to ask investment banking questions and overly difficult questions. Also, be more responsive to the first and second analyst class - we will help you and HR refine the program so work with us. Take each of our feedback seriously."
Please hire appropriate top management to lead the company. Your market shares has dropped to the bottom and Fitch is more than happy to gobble them up.
 
 
 
Stick to a president for a while so the culture you want can take hold. Value our employees truly -- don't just give it lip service. If you're going to be quick to change process that you need to be quick to respond to employees' needs. The lag creates animosity.
Invest more in development and stop losing senior women
Good work!! keep going but need higher level management more accessible
Improve compensation and streamline compliance as much as possible.
"Keep up the good work. As long as you keep the same business model, you'll be successufl."
 
 
Promote culture to hire from within rather than go outside to fill positions especially in upper management.   Stop it will all the compliance training.
 
"Put people first--all of your employees, not just upper management."
 
"Destroying the company, very shortsighted.  Looking only to maximize shareholder value and increase size of its own bonus."
enforce accountability and change to meritocracy.
 
Review your management team OFTEN - listen to those that report to them - believe what you actually see not hear from your management team. No manager is infallible so stop paying your lawyers to bail the incompetent out.  STOP OUTSOURCING - you'll never get your clients approval or restore their faith in the company until the environment changes and you go back to appreciating your employees.
Improve internal mobility and work on internal talent development and retention.
 
Cherish your people!  Analytical minds are your core asset.
"Taper down the NY big corporate tone. After all, people who get things done are located in other offices. Value your employee with promotions, not stagnant wages and no development."
Who would listen really? So I rest my case.
 
 
Transparency works both ways not just for the public eye. Alot of employees are unhappy because noone is saying anything.
"Would advise to raise pay to keep top performers.  Even though it seems this is the rating agency model to tamp down on salaries, it would pay off in the long run to keep the brightest employees."
 
Keep up the good work; I applaud your ability to maximize shareholder value in the monopoly you took over. Cash in those stock options before the decline in market share. Citi model seems to be working well so far!
 
 
"The top leadership changes had critical impact across entire corporation. Employees understand need to change, adapt and modernize but was handled poorly and at expense of dedicated employees. Look at ratio between consultants, legal, compliance and analysts -- there is a significant imbalance."
 
 
Invest more funding in better more efficient technology
#NAME?
"You are destroying an excellent and profitable franchise. Your strategy might increase the margins over the short term, but you need to focus on the credit analytics and retain experienced analysts for the long term health of the company. What reason do you think you are offering analysts to stay at S&P?"
"Too many chiefs not enough Indians. 
Dony think asking us to fill out surveys will give you the truth from employees. Don't tell us to start documenting our projects and hours and telling us McKinsey wants to help us ""streamline""projects. We all know what that means. All the good people are leaving the firm and you let go of all the good senior managers in the last layoff."
Onboard new contractors so they know what to expect from the company.
none
"This was once a great firm that people were proud to work for. Sadly, it is no more."
Take a hard look at what is and is not working and listen to the analysts not the shared support groups
 
"have a stable senior management, more cross training opportunities, provide internal promotions instead of hiring from outside"
 
"Losing talent over new changes. Employees don't like the new changes going on and you just ignore them and think they will adjust. You only care about saving money not making your employees happy. Run a survey on how many people have left Corp Ratings after consultants came in instead of asking for a weekly ""anonymous"" survey where no will tell the truth of how they really feel. New floor plans are not popular."
"Need to be more innovative, we seem to be stuck in our ways. Less innovation leads to poor public perception and lawsuits from the DOJ."
"The easiest thing to do is to cut expenses. In s&p's case revenues will not be impacted and margins will go up. But the quality of the work will go down.

Let analysts be analysts and realize that good analysts need time to do their work. Reduce beurocracy and reward people that work hard, otherwise the talented people will find a job elsewhere.

Stop and think about the company's future, not your compensation today."
 
None.  Its a quasi government entity that has no real skin in the game.
"Realize that this is a human capital business, and behave as if you value the capital that walks out the door every day."
Cut costs in letting go of areas where there are too many managers and less people working on the data
"Never forget those who are the foundation of your support, especially for annual/spot bonuses.  No one works hard all year for just a box of chocolate."
 
Better focus on analytics and the people
 
Stop trying to do more with less.
Support your employees
clean house again
"Standard and Poor's needs to get it's tech up. There was some old technology being used when I was there, but they are working to modernize (there was a CEO change and the new one seems to be more on top of that)."
People are your asset. Stop outsourcing.
Update technology; let analysts do their jobs; hire more administrative staff to handle appropriate level work;
"Be more responsive to employee (current and former) complaints about abusive behavior.
Consult industry specialists to gauge potential impact of across-theon-board cost-saving actions."
Thank you for your continued mentoring!
 
Be more aware of how middle management is actually supervising staff.
 
 
Institute and accountability based culture.
 
"Understand that the fundamentals of ratings is to give investors an opinion of the credit risk. Allow the analysts to provide analytic. Also know that at times, the analytic is qualitative and not quantitative, so we can't possibly put into numbers why we arrive at a certain rating."
need to embrace risk consulting like Moody's and Big Four
Treat workers like you would want to be treated
 
"Help employees grow within the organization, at times I feel I could be challenged way more."
Invest in your talent instead of downsizing it!!!
Allow people to do what they were hired to do.   Just because somebody doesn't have an advanced degree doesn't mean they can't do the job.
 
The future of the business is technology. Treat your technology team as business partners.
good place to work in NY
"Be more honest with your employees. Stand up to your responsibilities
 as a manager."
"This business is management's to lose; focus on the core business, don't over-complicate."
Need to look at people's personality before hiring
Need to optimize resource
Get leaner
 
Hold people accountable for their actions.  There is work to be done.
"I feel upper management of which I was a part of needs to know who the right people are for the job they need to have done. Some upper management are to big for their own shoes,"
"should establish career path , well defined goals to employees at the beginning of the year."
Meet more often and on a predictable consistent schedule.
Learn from the mistakes from the past and reinvent your business. Ignore your competitors ratings and develop a truly independent viewpoint.
 
Do away with the blocking system in ratings services let your employees grow with in the company
good thing this place closed down
 
Get your house in order internally before you try to win over people on the outside.
Mentor more and provide more growth opportunities
 
First and foremost stop outsourcing jobs. Your customers hate having to deal with India. This is going to end up biting you in the end.
 
 
Managers need to be trained at being managers.  Company needs better communication from the top down.
Nothing that i can add at this time
Should have better defined roles and growth plans for business analyst
 
 
 
"Keep doing much of the same, embrace the new ideas you can get from employees."
 
 
Be more competitive with your salary.
 
Your assets - the analysts - walk out the door every night.
 
Need to place a stronger emphasis on making those in the second tier of management happier and more engaged in the strategy. The company has gone through some ups and downs and many changes over the past coiuple of years.
 
Promote within is usually great for moral..
"Faster promotions for those that deserve it. The best employees aren't going to wait around to get one, they want to see that their work is rewarded or they will find somebody else who will. The politics and meetings kill productivity, and should be eliminated."
 
Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.  Manages changes carefully.
Invest in your employees by promoting from within.
 
"Political situation way too complex for a trite recommendation. However it needs to be addressed. Recommend creating a true ombudsman department, with several members and an organization process to explore issues that employees raise - and bring concerns, results and patterns of complaints to C-level management so they can start to become aware of the real issues, while not exposing the ""whistle blowers"" to risk."
Hold job performance and understanding of markets and PEOPLE to higher standard than you hold ambitious employees' kiss-up abilities.
"less micromanagement, more trust in employees"
stop paying your analysts less to do more
 
"- Pay a decent amount to interns. Something comparable to other financial services firms. $15/hr is almost an insult

- Revamp the internship program so that the internships could possibly end up in full-time offers. Just like any investment bank does"
 
 
"If S&P is to remain viable as a Ratings/Financial Company, it can not be run under the management of or as part of a bookstore manager's mentality."
"Cut dead wood. Don't just shuffle people around to make them another manager's problem. Cut down on politics and jockeying for position. focus on doing what's right for the customers/company, and not what will get you a title or an office."
Increase compensation for advance education
Revise your scrum process...people with out technical back ground run the agile meeting and they gave examples which are far off from reality
 
need to communicate better and more timely
Per Lou - We can be a billion dollar bureaucracy or a billion dollar startup.  We are the former.  Focus on results instead of processes.
 
Stop hiring everyone from Thompson/Reuters.  Replace the top 2 levels of management.
Show some respect and courtesy to consultants instead of treating them like servants. Check that employees do their duty well and establish a good process.
 
please try to hire some intern for the full time
"increase compensation level for senior level jobs
cut the time spent on meaningless meetings
increase on-job training opportunities for all employees"
 
"No advice would be constructive. Most of these people don't really care about their jobs and just work to support their families. Dog eat dog world, blah blah, you know the whole drill :)"
"Take a real good look and weed out all the ""yes men"" that say ""I can do that"", knowing full well they can not and also knowing that they will never be called out for their incompetence."
 
 
Get back to focusing on what works
Major change in process is required. Try to put consultants in better roles and dont treat them like cheap labors.
Treat others as you would like to be treated. The golden rule never hurt a soul.
More innovation would be an improvement
"None,"
Compensate staff to get more productivity
Realize the biggest asset you have is the people and their knowlegde content that are working for you.  Treat them with with the utmost respect.
They need to figure out how to start evaluating people based on their current performance and play more of a mentorship role.
"Pay and reward people based on what they would be worth outside of S&P - and you'll find that junior people are probably underpaid and senior people are grossly overpaid.
Axe executives who show no leaderhsip yet maintain key leadership roles (Sharma, Milano).
Establish metrics beyond financial metrics to help you understand the real performance story."
"Please stop pushing administrative tasks on to the analysts and analytical managers. Help them to keep their focus on the rating process, which is where it should be. Ask for feedback on processes before you roll them out. And, when you do ask for feedback, make sure you act on it."
Old regime cannot compete with competition nor in today's market. The entire organization as a whole needs an overhaul from management down to process and technical rigor.
"Hvae better structure, and reward employees according to their work performance"
try and make a unified approach to talent retention.  we lose way too many good people because we treat outsiders better then insiders.
"Stick to the basics, and stop handcuffing the analytic process with administrative tasks."
Learn how to communicate better with the new generation of workers
pay competitively based on the industry coverage of the analyst
Create a plan and STICK to it.
"None at the moment really. Overall, it really is a great company to work at due to the corporate culture and environment."
I thought that the management did a very good job at S&P. I got along very well with my managers.
Fund growth initiatives with $$$. You're not going to grow the company if you refuse to take any risks going forward.
"Definitely not a bad place to work, but they need to do a better job compensating employees and a better job coming up with more interesting projects."
Best of luck.
Value your people. Create systems that enable and encourage great work rather than encourage gaming the system.
Reward your people and get rid of the union.
Don't forget your employees.
Be open to regulatory reform instead of fighting it. If you have good talented employees that a rating agency can thrive even in a competitive environment.
Remember that S&P's most valuable assets are their employees.
"Beef up the bonuses, or watch those revolving doors spin..."
"When morale has been low for a long time now, and all it would take is some focus on career development!"
"Try your best to be proactive instead of reactive. Internally, employees feel that S&P is always a day late and a dollar short."
"Develop a porgram to better manage the talent in place  and create more opportunities for employees to move around within the company, so that they don't feel like they have to leave in order to advance professionally."
retire and let people with ideas and guts take over so that there is somebody there to make business decisions
Hope to see changes in working environment to become more result- driven environment.  Too slow in its decision and project execution.
"Clearly define professional track
Hire knowledgeable staff"
Management needs to get rid of most of the middle management layer that has been in place for 20+ years.  These middle managers are biding their time until retirement rather than moving the company forward.
Management needs to be more risk taking and more forthcoming.
there should be more cooperation between groups withing the company.  Management should focus on making it more like one big company instead of a bunch of small ones.
"Work harder to award innovation, intelligence, efficiency.  Forget about how S&P has done things in the past."
There is a tremendous amount of bureaucracy at S&P -- it seems that everyone there is a manger or director. I feel that it is a little top-heavy.
"Learn your business
Start respecting your employees
Bring more U.S. based analysts into senior management ranks. Skip the the current senior and middle management and pull from the team level.
Your analytical team is very very unhappy"
"-promote people within by providing them the tools and flexibility to succeed
-make sure they are happy in their current roles
-rotate people so they are not bored
-try to automate things and change old computer systems
-eliminate redundancy 
-g"
Get a decisive leader who will hire some competent criteria officers for the structured group.
"S&P has good lower level and middle managers, but historically in Structured finance and generally at the most senior levels of the company, you have incompetent, unqualified executives. That is starting to change, too bad it took a crisis to be the catalyst."
You should really consider all the assets you have at your disposal.  Do not ruin the talent of the people you sucker into working here.
fire the incompetent people! ditch the issuer pay model or at least play hardball with bankers/issuers! fire the lazy people! pleaseeee.
Please invest more in technology and administrative support
Not much
"Turn the place into a true meritocracy - promote collaboration within and across groups, punish silo mentalities"
"Invest in the business: IT, software, financial modeling, research, database infrustructure."
Senior Management of McGraw-Hill needs to pay more attention to what is happening within subsidiaries and their divisions outside of Manhattan and surveying employees once a year is not enough attention to pay.
Try to communicate the potential benefits of working harder and not being satisfied with the status quo.
Create career advancement opportunities for your employees.  They should be achievable and transparent.  Think big but act small.  Be more entrepreneurial and less buracratic.
"Cull.  Pay more to attract  more people.  Promote managers who are both knowledgeable and leaders, and stop promoting them because they've been there a long time."
To take an interest in their employee morale and reduce the amount of repetition involved in the work. Empower your employees and give them access to various learning tools (I think it's only the Bethesda office that lacks access).
"The company has too many chiefs and not enough indians, to borrow a cliche. It is almost a joke for anyone with a title of Director or above because they do absolutely no work and create meaningless work for the people below them. It is difficult for senior management to cut the chiefs because they tend to be their ex-coworkers in previous companies. But ultimately, they must be eliminated from the company in order to allow for the hard-working employees to rise. Senior management needs to wake up and realize that the company is considered a joke by many investment firms. Spend more money on technology but please hire IT folks that actually know what they are doing and can speak English. It is difficult enough trying to call India for desktop support. But don't hire consultants who do the IT programming and business analyst work who speak in heavy accents...No one can understand them!!"
Please provide more frequent feedback and less formality.
Be more forthright about the direction of the company
 
 
None
Keep up things like #ChangePays
 
Break up the SNL crew so that they assimilate into the rest of the company.  Stop giving all their leaders the best jobs. The are a click and they stick together.  very sexist and racist crew.
 
"Completely restructure your SVP, VP  roles so there are improved reporting functions and accountability. More importantly, mandate formal processes to be developed and implemented PRIOR to trying to automate and implement technologies.  Bringing in tools as a quick fix to try to mature wont work as your internal departments and functions have no idea what each other are doing and they cannot even explain if you ask them. This spells continual rework and people moving on to greener pastures.  Good luck."
Your Chiefs and CTOs and CIOs are ego driven and don't care about the company and are not nice to those around them unless junior level.  Some exceptions but this is a boys club most got their jobs because they were in a department and a friend pulled them in for a higher level job with them.  Get real experts in these roles not people who are there because they were friends with others at the top.
"I know it's a big corporation, but I think retaining current talent should be a priority. S&amp;P Global should be more willing to"
 
"- Be employee first companies.
- Listen to employees and their ideas
- Don't set unrealistic targets 
- Change the org cultural first, make it open. 
- Have FinTech mindset"
Poor decision by CPO to sacrifice FTEs for flashy and costly HR offsite; even worse that CFO and CEO authorized this trip
"Giving time back to analysts is great, but if all the good analysts leave because the salaries are abysmal, time back to analysts won't matter."
"Change culture, be open to new ideas, listen to new associates."
 
Hold all managers accountable for bad behavior.  Stop protecting the “so called” hi potential males that continue to promote bad behavior.  Recruit more women and people of color and make more meaningful efforts to keep them.  The Board of Directors should demand more progress on those stats. If you share flat results year after year on earnings you get fired but same results for Diversity get ignored.
 
.
"Think like consultants, not publishers of data"
Managers do not manage well and care not for the employee but the metrics. A KPI means KEY. Management will live with ANY performance indicators.  It’s made up metrics.
 
 
Hire more employees from within the company. Create more abilities for team members to meet their manager in person to foster a better relationship
Hire American!
 
 
Treat good people right.  Get rid of the middle management that get bonuses when they screw over good people.
Don't outsource.
Decisions seem to be not about making product better but how to just do it cheaper. Instead of working at firm that’s decades old feels like startup mentality pinching pennies when have huge profit margins so can make improvements if wanted
-
A bit of job rotation is a good thing
 
Fire all the architects in the company
 
 
Give employees opportunities to develop
 
 
 
 
 
put yourself in your employees shoes
Promoting from within is not a bad thing.  Internal promotion motivates others in thinking that it is possible for them to get to certain position.
 
nothing
"Focus more on people development and stability - don't try to reinvent the wheel all the time and hire new people to replace the old ones, because their ideas are not necessarily better."
Cross business unit experience need to be rewarded more - maybe even make it mandatory to be promoted above Director level.
"Where to begin?  Well, first, you might actually learn the ratings business..."
"Management should assess the leadership to assure the right, experienced people are in those positions.  Also, the organization changes should stabilize so staff do not feel uneasy."
 
"Change policies towards common people, let us grow professionally and financially."
Like they Say - Hire American and Make America Great Again - IT is like you put a small group of high school students in India on a raft and sailed to Battery Park.   Employees with that little education or experience need professionals around not old foggy business people that think hacking is the new waterfall.
Mostly just keep doing what you've been doing. Stay in touch with those who are selling and who support them. Train as much as is feasible.
 
None
Keep up the good work!
Choose your projects wisely and commit. Commit to eliminating technical debt.
Why bother. They don't care. Don't read this site anyway and probably would slough off comments as those of a chronic malcontent.
 
"company should promote work-life balance by implementing proper policies. after all, happy employees = great results!"
Ensure people being promoted into managerial positions are ready to take on these types of assignments.
Decompress
 
Being open-minded to new ideas and expressing a degree of flexibility.
 
Take care of your people
More opportunities to advance.  Work with everyone to help establish a carreer path not just upper management
 
 
 
 
 
 
Must find a way to reduce the chaos by either combining services or detaching them - leaving things in limbo caused confusion for staff and clients; provide more training to new employees; provide opportunities for ongoing internal training
 
Get new management
"This is 2016 and with the majority of the workforce being millennials, it is important to be open and flexible with employees.  You will have a lot more loyalty and less turnover this way."
"-Take on a chance on some new content management software
-Provide more transparency on the future state of the business and how/why current decision are going to get us there."
Total tunnel vision right now. Look at the bigger picture. We are no longer two companies. We need to take the best of both sides.
Make the hard choices now to keep up with the times
 
 
 
 
"HR needs an overhaul and must take more responsibility onboarding talent and stop pushing this on the support staff to handle. HR and management also need to have regular check-in conversations with staff. There are so many unhappy people working at this company, but no one really seems to care."
 
 
Keep in mind that employees need to connect with a positive purpose that transcends higher revenue and margins and lower costs.
 
 
 
"Stay focused, grow both organically and via acquisitions and reward people for their contributions - then the sky is the limit."
stop playing favorites
 
 
Bring back the flex time and working remotely.
 
"You have responsibilities to three groups: your customers, your shareholders and your employees. Always keep them balanced. MHFI seems to be following the example of too many corporations, taking care of the folks in the C suite at the expense of the grunts on the shop floor."
 
 
HT needs to focus on the needs of the business rather than internal politics.
Return to your old values.
Just break up the company into the business units and eliminate corporate executive management.
 
 
Dearest Doug Peterson and management - you are not the only game in town.  Here's what we know: you don't care about your employees or value us.  Thanks anyway.
Enable those closest to the customer  to innovate
 
 
 
make people want to come to work. a little cheerleading and congratulations go a long way
 
More focus on training and hiring the intelligent upper managers/Directors.
Create career-path instead of just a place for retirement
"doesn't matter what i say here, not at all"
 
"Make longer-term decisions, not just short term."
"You guys have essentially killed any 'quality of work life' by this genius move ""from Value company to Growth company"".  Yeah right.  OK, now freeze spending company wide in 2014.  So we can't actually function, but we'll come in everyday to zero forward motion, no projects, no initiatives.  There's no money for that!  We want to be SURE that Mr. Peterson (hey, you seem like a nice guy) get his $1.1 million bonus plus $4 million equity for MHF having such a great year.  For you, yeah."
Become ahead of the game with regards to where book sales are going.
 
 
Try to remember the company's vision is more than saving a buck.  Quality and customer service are still relevant.
 
Pick and path and execute.  Empower the ranks to drive positive change forward and reduce bottlenecks.
Allow more benefits outside and within the office for employees.
 
"Find a way to keep the capable people, let them know they are valued. Provide opportunities for employees, don't just depend on the same people and assign them to every project; invest in technology and don't continually 'make-do' and work around the old technology. Make a decision to be innovative and find the budget for it. Move into this century with a better vacation package for your employees, it provide a better work/life balance."
 
"Better communication about outlook and possible restructurings, and technology a bit behind other peer companies"
Keep doing your thing.
 
Further increase internal communication to align their work with corporate priorities.
 
 
Streamline and flatten Management
Keep empowerng employees; increase transparency of all actions; enhance communication
"They should balance the boat with american values that mix of cultures brings. You are not outsourced yet, so stop behaving like you are back home already.
Such should clean their ranks first of all these smiling faces with no values. Get people who have a desire to create and ideas how to do it. Not all these ""don't bark on me i won't bark on you"" personalities.
Second, figure out what do they want to do - now they are just running the wave out with nothing new in the pipe."
Listen to the people you hire to do the job.
 
Needed more communications with the employees.
 
"Streamline and improve the back office functions. Real estate, IT costs, etc. are too big a burden on operating units and are not responsive enough."
 
Compensate better to motivate employees to stay and fight with old timers to bring the change to company. Do better and more detailed review of old timers: there are a lot of people who have senior titles and not doing much and not knowing much - completely out of touch with technology advancements.
Continue the great on boarding process for all new employees and reinforce the value of the peer mentor role.
more transparency........reach down in the ranks more
None.
"Encourage collaboration 
Develop green talent, there is a major focus on retaining top level employees when more junior employees do the grunt work"

"Sell the education division, recognizing your upper mgmt is out of its depth. Ah, you did."
 
"HR Management should be challenged to pursue a clear career track initiatives for upwardly mobile employees, especially for women and people of color."
Do a better job at recognizing unconventional talent
 
"Virtually all of senior management needs to be replaced, especially the president of McGraw-Hill Higher Education."
Get a clue...
The grass is not always greener when considering outside hires.  Reward your loyal and productive employees with chances to advance.
n/a
Get a better performance recognition program that has structure.  Upper management seems to only recognize their favorites and not the effort that was put into a project when handing out bonuses.  Look at the performance & skills of the shared services management.  None of them know the first thing about developing employees and they hide in their offices and are nowhere to be found.
You must innovate and move faster.  Be less political.
"Favor substance over process, eliminate the computer-model driven reviews and quit marginalizing good workers, empower middle-management"
Need to give your UX team room to grow.
get a handle on the corporate politics.  get off the outsourcing/offshoring bandwagon.
"Listen to your PEONS. They know more than you think. WE are the ones talking to the customers, NOT YOU. You talk among yourselves about money and layoffs, we talk among each other about ways to improve processes. I just WISH I was in a position to make changes. The company would stop wasting time and money on stupid repetitive processes they pay us to do everyday, and these processes would be automated."
Encourage staff more and recognize the efforts of all staff.
They were fine. No comments.
"Lean Six Sigma is broken, as some solutions are not implemented."
Add metrics for 'speed' and customer perspective; establish a formal training and performance improvement organization; fill some senior exec roles from within
 
Too much of a good-old boy network.  CEO needs to step down and take some of his cronies with him.  Doubtful that company will be able to succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace as long as it continues to rely on advice of same senior managers.
Give real P&L responsibility to executives with digital experience
"New Corporate Leadership, commit to a pay for performance culture, walk the walk"
Offer competitive salaries for experienced professionals. Invest in promoted leadership to develop mgmt skills.
Take a hard look at favoritism dynamic.
"it doesn't take a lot to show appreciation to your staff or team members.  Appreciation does not always have to be a higher wage, but kind words, encouragements, little gifts or tokens, a nice note, etc."
 
 
Walk the talk.
get on board with textbook rentals
Pay attention to your employees. You let a lot of good people go for the sake of keeping those that have been there a long time picking their noses and depending on others to trouble shoot and work.
De-layer. Fund growth.
"I am very proud to work for McGraw-Hill, and especially proud of our senior leadership.  I would recommend others to seek jobs within the company."
 
improve communication between segments to elimiante duplication in efforts and improve planning to ensure clear understanding and buyin from employees
"Do something real or get out.  Stop pretending that the company is a Global company because it isn't.  MH is a New York company that has other remote office.  The fact that the term ""remote office"" is used at all shows that MC does not believe anyone outside of NYC is worth their time."
"Think about the rank and file employees and what the work environment is like for them.  Unify the company to act as one -- not compete and work against one another.  As a knowledge company, your greatest asset is your people."
"Focus on remove under performers, promote hard work, vs old fashion loyalty, and create a new graduate recruitment program to attract new and bright minds"
Think out of the box- -and don't just say it in meetings-- really do it!
There's a need for more dynamic management at the company. There are too many B and C players in key roles.
"Trust your employees.  Don't offer simple buzzwords.  Also, look outward.  Most of the time you seemed to be navelgazing."
more focus most of the time
Focus on lower levels for development to feed the talent pipeline and reward innovation.
"Show your employees some respect. You're not high school principals; trust the people you've hired to do their jobs well, and they will respond by exceeding your expectations. Have you learned nothing from the mass exodus you witnessed in 2009 after you so gleefully stated in your ""town hall"" meeting that jobs are scarce, but anyone who doesn't like it at MH could leave?"
Act on the procedures you've implemented.  Give the big picture to everyone on the team--most people are pigeonholed into their own corner and don't think twice about how their actions affect the entire program.
Time for a new CEO
You should really reward hard work and performance swiftly and promptly.  Individual career paths should be focused and management needs to be accountable for their employee's advancement.
Continue to review the salary process to retain good staff. I agree with others that the 2-3 percent annual rate increases are too low compared to the cost of living.
Recognize the recent leadership failures are a root cause of inabiltiy to achieve sufficient success in your digital transformation - more will happen. You need to move this effort outside of the current culture.
Look for a new way forward--and bring in some people with a track record of innovation and understanding of the Digital Age.
"If the business unit is collapsing fire someone above the level of director. THEY ARE NOT THE PROBLEM, SENIOR MANAGEMENT IS!"
Show gratitude to your employees so you stop losing the talent; foster an environment that promotes career growth; do more than just say how great an employer you are and show it.
Notice the immensely talented and promote.  Retain the best or bring back the ones you know make a difference to McGraw-Hill and its future.
Make it possible for employees to experience growth and don't be afraid of new ideas.
"You truly need to listen to your employees who are ""in the trenches"" and step off your ivory towers. Bad decisions are made because of ""yes men"" who pander to upper management."
"Leadership should be aware that there are other employees there that deserve a chance to move ahead, not just the ones that are already in executive roles."
"Provide employees with solid numbers regarding expectations, accuracy percentages and number of papers needed to be graded in order to stay on the project."
"Please read the review above and give some thought to how you treat your workers.  Frankly, it is unconscionable to reap the fruits of the labor of persons who contribute to your ""bottom line"" on what amounts to a full-time basis and yet hang these people out to dry as ""temps"" indefinitely."
More progressive work environment.
Get new senior management
Much work has to be done in professional development.
Make an effort to keep your word--especially concerning promised raises and elevation of contract workforce to regular-staff status. Make the most of staff enthusiasm by extending some real sign of gratitude.
"Train the trainer, teach more staff to fish vs do all the fishing for them. Cross discipline training should be adopted vs. single staff person is the person who is only responsible for doing one thing."
I would improve career opportunities for some of your higher performing employees. Get rid of the dinosaurs in the company that can not adapt to the new environment.
Spend more time  planning future revenue streams/alternative businesses; spend more time building concensus within the segment.
"Stop being so stuck up and firm and take the time to honestly consider your employees as human beings, not robots"
"Hire the Kelly employess who have shown their worth.  It is unfair to them to keep them as temporary employees for years at a time.  They can be hired as project status, and it would probably actually cost the company less."
"Pull your heads out of your ass and start doing your jobs.  Listen to people who work there and get them to trust the company.

Move most of the operations and infrastructure out of New York and New Jersey."
"Pay better, improve communications, restore pay cuts. Reward good performance with monetary incentives, not just praise."
"Take some of the management courses you continue to force on others. Since most of MH senior management is hired externally, they have no previous knowledge or experience about MH policy, yet they are given any training in this respect. 
Also stop trying to make a name for yourself at the cost of your staff. Most likely you are new to MH, but your staff has had to prove themselves for years to every other 'new' sr. manager!"
"Look beyond the numbers when you make decisions. Do a real employee survey to see what people think of the company and be honest with the results. Think long term. You make decisions which benefit the year, but you don't think of the longer term impact of these decisions. Think productivity has dropped since you started aggressively laying people off every year? Well it has."
"See above. As much as the senior management like to portray an image of adaptability to its stock holders and clients, it's not all that. Perhaps it is in the education field where it has been quick to adopt new technologies and such, but in the work force it still has a way to go."
"Even some people in senior management are ready to retire in this company, they still need to sell their groups."
More perfance based incentives.
