Don't say anything wind or solar energy. What are other names for fossil fuels? What is the greenhouse effect? What are some greenhouse gasses besides CO2? - ex. methane gas Then i needed to do a few math problems involving averages. Ex. If you knew the price of an energy commodity for July and knew price of the combined July and August price. How do you find the August price? If you have the price of Sept and the price of the Sep/Oct/Nov bundle price can you find the individual price of Oct and the individual price of Nov? The answer is no, you can only find the average of the Oct and Nov bundles. They were easy problems but my main concern was that they were too easy so I was looking for a trap. There wasn't a trap. Basically they wanted to see your reasoning skills. After about an hour with the editor I spoke to his boss. This was more of a chat about who I was and what I could bring to the company.

In a couple of days I received a phone call from HR who wanted to arrange an interview for one of the editorial positions. I am coming from overseas and require a visa sponsorship, which usually can be a problem. HR confirmed by e-mail that they are willing to sponsor me if I pass an editorial test and go through the interview. I got an interview with Managing Editor and Editorial Director and then I did one hour editorial test. I enjoyed the interview process and was asked many interesting questions about current affairs and discuss some issues of the industry. My interviewees were friendly and meeting this kind of people really encouraged me to get the job at Platts. Test is not easy, but doable, especially if you prepare in advance. Usually HR would send the information about the test several days in advance and you will have time to prepare. I have not heard back from HR for 2 weeks and decided to follow up and get a feedback. I also found that they advertise new position on different desk where my language skills can be useful. I asked HR if I can be considered for this new position as well. HR got back to me straight away saying that they still deciding on the fist position and they are happy to consider me for new role too. My interview for the new role on different desk was scheduled in the beginning of January. I met Editor in Chief and Managing Editor. I didn't have to do the test again and my interview went very well according to HR's feedback. Still I was completely clueless about the result of my first interview. However on my second interview I was told that I successfully passed the test. In another 2 weeks I was invited for the second round of interviews for the second position I applied. I met Editor in Chief again and Editorial director, I also was introduced to some members of the team and was showed around the office. During the interview I also was told that the only reason I didn't get an offer for the first position I applied was the fact that it was maternity cover role and the company can only sponsor a visa for full-time positions. Very strange situation, as in the very beginning I was told by e-mail that they are OK to sponsor my visa, otherwise it was no point even to come for an interview. Next day I receive a very positive call from HR that my second interview went fantastic and hopefully I will receive a good news soon. He also asked me to send him a copy of my residence permit, as their visa agency wanted to start the process. I have not heard from Platts for a week and e-mailed HR and received back not so positive call, that HR couldn't reach hiring managers as they are away. Today after two and a half weeks I received a call from HR who told that they wanted to make me an offer, but decided to give a job to internal candidate as his role at another department was put at risk. Results: 3 months of interviews, preparations, anxious waiting for feedback and I wonder if the positions I applied were even available or exciting.

I was informed via phone and on the day that it will be a 2 hour interview process split into 2 parts. The 1st hour will be an interview followed by a 1 hour copy-writing test. When the interview started it was going well and went on for an hour and 20 mins. After 1 hr 20 mins I was told I have to start the copy-writing test. The test paper also very clearly stated it was a 1 hour test. Much to my surprise, the hiring manager was back in around 40 mins and asked me to stop my test, which was quite shocking as it was meant to be a 1 hr test. The hiring manager informed me that the they thought the interview went quite well and that I had the skills and qualities to match this role. When I told him that I needed more time for the test as it was a 1 hr test, he informed me that since the interview went so well, the test performance will be reviewed accordingly. When asked why he had to finish the test abruptly, he informed me that he had another meeting to get into before which he had to collect the laptop on which I was doing the test. I did not argue much as he sounded very positive from his talk. Almost after a week of follow up, I received an email from HR letting me that unfortunately they will not be going ahead with my application. On contacting HR they informed me that on basis on the interview and project, they had found a better candidate. I was extremely shocked by this response as I thought this was an unfair process. As a candidate who removes time from his/her current job, takes an effort to get to an interview and give their best shot and puts their hopes on an interview; I felt exploited and cheated as a candidate. My test was evaluated against another candidate who got a full 1 hour to perform in his/her copy-writing test while I was not given my full time to perform. How can they choose another employee on basis on an interview which was not a fair process for the other candidate? When I raised this with the HR the response I got was they will have an internal investigation, but I should not hope to get the job as they have offered it to someone else. the whole question here is, how is it justified to offer another candidate a role over me, when the process followed for me is incomplete and unfair? S&P Global Platts is renowned to be a globally present company and that has equal opportunities for all.

Interview was extremely positive with her ending by saying she wanted me to meet her manager when he is in town.

After not hearing anything I chased her and she replied that there has been no change. Then 3 weeks after, the role was posted on the website. I contacted her again and she said they have already given an offer & I was not qualified as they wanted an ex-client of theirs or an oil and gas industry specialist - when I had asked her originally if my background was suitable she said it was great & said alot of people come in from outside of the industry with good sales experience.

The first interview went well, hence the second, and I thought the second also went quite well and was confident of a positive outcome. That last interview was almost five weeks ago, and despite multiple attempts to contact the recruitment team I have not heard back at all from them. Over the two interviews I took several hours out of my personal time (one was after work) to attend, and yet evidently they have not the courtesy to even tell me the outcome. Reading other interview reviews, it seems this is a common practice when they don't want to proceed with a candidate. I'm not even bothered about feedback or reasons, just a confirmation of not going further which takes literally 10 seconds on email. Note to S&P HR if you bother to read this stuff - it's 2018, these type of recruitment practices are not acceptable any more. The things that people care most about in a workplace these days are environment, culture, people and brand, and it doesn't surprise me at all that your GD reviews are so bad if this interview experience is indicative of S&P's attitude to those things.",No Offer,Negative, , ,It was all informal based on my experience., , , , ,

When I arrived, the main interviewer said that he hadn’t prepared for the interview. It quickly became clear that he hadn’t even looked at my CV prior to the interview. This was very disappointing, given that I had spent several hours preparing for the interview. The other two interviewers arrived late, to the extent that neither I nor the main interviewer thought they would turn up at all. When they finally arrived, they were very lackadaisical not only in their approach to the interview but also in their attitude to the company. They had very few questions for me, which I felt put me at a disadvantage. Overall, I came away with the impression that the way the interview was conducted was very unprofessional.

The person from the HR department who sent me the invitation and who I was supposed to meet did not show up when I came to the office. Even though I had sent an updated version of my CV, the HR department had never forwarded it to the interviewer. On the other hand, the interviewer, the receptionists and the lady who set up the hiring test for me were extremely kind and helpful. The interview felt more like a conversation rather than a strict Q&A session. The test was okay although you need to be ready to be distracted by the surrounding noise.
