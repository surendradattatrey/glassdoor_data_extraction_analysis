At the end of the conversation she had scheduled my next phone interview with the ""would be"" hiring manager for the following week. I spoke to the hiring manager and it was a 30 min conversation. Some of the questions she asked were about project management - Agile vs. Waterfall methodologies. The difficulties I experience with Agile. They use Agile method, so make sure you understand this method of PM. Asked me about Business Analysis and how I collected requirements (different ways) and what type of documentation (workflows, BRDs, Functional requirements, etc...) After that phone interview I heard back from HR department like 4 days later to schedule an in-person interview to meet with 4 individuals, including the would be hiring manager that I had already spoken to. During that interview there were a lot of questions about Project Management methods, more documentation question, the consistent question was what are the challenges you face with Agile method and how do you solve it?, A lot of questions about the correlation between business analysis and Agile method- be ready to elaborate on that. I was also given a scenario to solve on paper. If you are qualified for the position this won't be challenging, it was not difficult.

For the most part, it was a negative, but also important experience. It was important because it was an experience like no other, and that in itself provided a valuable experience that I can take with me and learn from. I interviewed with 5 total people: recruiter, hiring manager, teammate 1, teammate 2, and hiring manager's boss. Of these 5 people, it was the recruiter and hiring manager whom I liked (and I think also liked me). The teammates 1 and 2 I thought did not respect my experience what-so-ever. They drilled me with irrelevant technical, pointed questions that only someone who spends their fridays and saturday nights at home would know. They expected rote memorization in my answers. That is something, I am proud to say, I do not endorse. Moreover, they didn't let me talk about my experiences and what I've done in my career. They kept drilling me with technical questions. The hiring manager's boss (the last guy I interviewed with), just seemed like a jerk. He's probably the one who gave the orders for the nature of the interview. Also, they gave me a 50+ question technical exam. This exam you cannot do well unless you do significant preparation on beforehand. I think conducting such an exam, once again, indicates they do not respect your experience and believe that using such metrics indicate someone's intelligence and ability level. They will use the exam as a bargaining tool at the end of the interview. It's kinda deceptive. In the end, even if I got a job offer from S&P, I would have declined it.

They never gave me the opportunity to talk about what I did or my experience, and instead bombarded me with irrelevant technical questions that would never be applicable in the real world. The interviewer always tried to make me double guess my answer, even if it was correct. If I said something he disagreed with or believed to be incorrect, he would pounce on it and interrupt me without letting me finish my thought. He was very argumentive and there was no respect or professionalism. Not to mention, they made me take a lengthy, irrelevant examination right before interview and they will become very judgemental over you based off of how you do. Then, they will use that against you as a bargaining chip later on. I did not receive an offer, but even if I did, I would have rejected it immediately.

Our interview was short, exactly 30mins. She asked a few questions and went into details of the job expectations, the organizational alignment. We ended the interview and she did confirm there are 2 other individuals she has to interview as part of the internal recruiting process.

Here's the numbers - 500 candidate resumes received, 100 phone interviews conducted, 28 candidates invited to super day, 10 spots for each year's analyst class. 1) The phone interviews will ask technicals there's already interview reviews on glassdoor so check them out 2) The day before Super Day is pretty chill. They will set you up a hotel and airline as long as you're not local (aka NYU or Baruch). They had a dinner event for when you arrive while you 'network' with Directors from all major departments. After the dinner they'll have like a small corny teamwork building exercise. 3) The Super Day itself can be pretty intense. You'll be a part of the morning or afternoon interview time. The whole interview REALLY relies on who you'll have. If you have a super chill director from a non-intense team (small local US government - public finance) , then it's easy cruising. If you have a former banker veteran from a bulge bracket bank (JP Morgan, Goldman, etc) that's currently managing multiple teams (corporate) then expect to get hammered on technical questions. To be safe, I'd review all the general accounting questions and review some legit literature from the S&P website that's available publicly.

Throughout the process, the recruiters were very responsive and friendly. Started with a brief phone interview with my manager's manager, then about a 4-hour in-person interview with a peer, my direct manager, and her peer; separately, about an hour each. The phone interview was more of a get-to-know-you thing. With the in-person interview, they seemed to adhere to a pretty standard front-and-back sided 8.5x11"" questionnaire with questions about how you handle conflict, your learning style, etc. If you've been through a behavioral-based interview before, you know the type.

As others have experienced, 5 minutes before my scheduled phone interview, I received an email asking if I can push it back an hour due to someone else double-booking the manager's calendar. The manager on the phone was very friendly, but thought I had already spoken to HR about the role. She spoke about the role and emphasized they are looking for someone who is a good communicator, a good team fit, and someone willing to learn, rather than necessarily someone with a finance degree or Excel experience. I was offered an in-person interview the next day. The manager was running 30 minutes late (seems to be a theme here), so I met with the other 2 team members first (separately). The first question I was asked was ""Where are you from?"" which is not actually legal, so I would suggest the managers prepare inexperienced team members on how to conduct an interview. The other team member said he had 5 other interviews that day and was too tired to ask me questions so I could ask questions & said that most of the people are in their 20's&30's and they are looking to hire more young workers. Again, I would suggest training your staff on proper interviewing. The manager didn't ask me too many questions, as it appeared they had already made up their minds on hiring. The manager referred to the team as the boys."" It was very casual, if not too casual for the size of the company, and not very organized.

The first part is a simple online interview where you will be asked questions on Standard & Poor's: -Why S&P Credit Rating? Your motivation for applying to this programme -What do you know about S&P? -Which languages do you speak? Really simple but work well on your answers and know well what S&P does (not only on Credit Rating but also the other divisions). The second round of interviews are two phone calls that you will receive which are more technical than the video interview: -Walking them through your CV and motivation for applying to this role. -Questions on the Balance Sheet, how all the three financial statements are connected. -The most recent financial crisis: what happened -The Euro zone crisis: reasons behind -Current financial news: what is happening in Europe? with the ECB/ Federal Reserve? -Differences on the economic systems of North Korea and the United States. The third round is the more difficult and interesting one. This round is in London and you will be gathered among other candidates for the EMEA Credit Programme at S&P. You will have breakfast or lunch (depending on whether your interview is in the morning or afternoon) and you can get to know the candidates and analysts working there better. After breakfast/lunch you will be taken to different rooms where the interviewers will be seated. Questions are again around your motivation for S&P and situation questions (be ready to give PRECISE examples). Some examples are: -A situation where you had to work on a team -Situation where you showed leadership -Have you worked with programmes to handle data? Which ones? When? There are also technical question so know your Accounting well. I was also asked again for the reasons behind the Eurozone crisis/ why was Capital Expenditure important to analyse/ what things would I consider for analysing a country's Sovereign Debt. Get to know the information provided on S&P Credit Rating's webpage on ratings well, it can always be useful in case you are asked this type of questions. Another important TIP is to ask questions yourself. Really take the chance lo learn more about the analysts that are interviewing you, all of them have incredible insight on the day to day of a Credit Analyst. Enjoy yourself.

He then went to find a higher up, who came in and sat down with me individually as well. They were both very personable people and the interview never seemed contrived or awkward. The office was extremely nice and the environment was professional yet surprisingly calm. I received a phone call a few days later from the same person at HR. He gave me great reviews on my interview, actually quoting a couple of the things the interviewers had said about the interview. He then gave me the interview statistics of how many people applied (over a hundred) and how many people were called in for an interview (less than 10).

I pushed to have a telephone interview before a face to face, however i was assured the hiring managers were very eager to meet me, so i agreed to come for 'a chat'. I attended the interview and it was very obvious that one of the hiring managers had not read my CV, let alone ever being 'very eager' to meet me. It was obvious as she came to the meeting unprepared, without my CV and had no background information on me whatsoever. Her greeting was lackluster as I initiated and drove the handshake, pleasantries and small talk while we waited for the other interviewer. I felt like I was a burden to her. After about 5 minutes into the interview, it was very obvious that the role and I were not suited, from a skills or aspiration perspective. I was sold a role with variety and exciting work by the interviewer, however the hiring managers used the words 'Just keep the wheels turning for this application' many times. There was no variety and it was mentioned that the new CIO was putting pressure to reduce support for applications like this. I considered ending the interview myself, however I decided against it. Although it was obvious the role was not for me, the attitude of one of the interviews was dismissive and uninterested. I knew i didn't have the job when she muttered (literally) that she had no more questions after about 20 minutes into the interview. The other interviewer was pleasant and asked questions focused on what the role needed and what i could bring to the role. I left the interview feeling utterly deflated with the disinterested interviewer as well as angry with both the recruiter for refusing the telephone interview, as well as with myself for not ending the interview sooner.
